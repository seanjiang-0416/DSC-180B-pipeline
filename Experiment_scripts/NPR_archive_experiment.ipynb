A Vietnam vet, he suffered from PTSD along with his diabetes, high blood pressure, and smoking-induced COPD. He\\'d survived a bout of kidney cancer, too, along his medical journey.\\nIn late 2019 he came to see me because he was considering making a move to an assisted living facility. I thought it was a good idea — as an older male with previous suicide attempts, I was worried that loneliness would compound his difficulties.\\nCarl was estranged from his family. I knew he had an adult son and daughter, but he refused to talk about them let alone to them.\\nAssisted living would provide some community in addition to three squares a day. The facility also had a nurse who could help with medical care.\\nAbout a month after he moved there, the nurse called to tell me that she\\'d sent Carl to the hospital for fever and shortness of breath. His oxygen saturation had dipped below 90%.\\nThis was in early March, when COVID-19 was still mostly in China and Italy. Our lives hadn\\'t stopped. Yet.\\nCarl was admitted to the ICU with \"double pneumonia.\" On his chest X-ray, there was evidence of it in both lungs. Not surprising for an older man with a long history of smoking, lung disease and diabetes.\\nCarl narrowly avoided intubation. With careful ministrations he turned the corner and was discharged back to his facility after a lengthy hospitalization. A nasal swab came back positive for influenza. Flu had been the culprit!\\nHis return to assisted living occurred right around the time the world was shutting down. All of our lives were changing dramatically.\\nCarl was quarantined in the facility. The nurse working there actually lived-in during March and April, until it was no longer feasible. She and the other staff did everything they could to keep their residents safe.\\nThe happiest I heard him this whole year was when he revealed that he and some friends in the facility would play late night card games — with an assist from a friendly aide who didn\\'t report them.\\nPrior to his hospitalization, Carl had come in my office every month. It helped quell his anxiety. Now that his facility was on lockdown, our visits had to be by telephone.\\nI was amazed he\\'d survived his hospitalization, let alone that he had somehow missed getting COVID. His lungs were practically kindling for this type of infection.\\nThroughout the spring, summer and fall, Carl and I talked, sometimes weekly. He was frustrated that he couldn\\'t go anywhere.\\nIn one of the perversities of the pandemic, Carl started smoking again just so he could go outdoors to have a cigarette a few times per day.\\nThe happiest I heard him this whole year was when he revealed that he and some friends in the facility would play late night card games — with an assist from a friendly aide who didn\\'t report them.\\nBy fall, there had been sporadic cases in his facility. He and his fellow card players were remanded to their rooms again. He was not a happy camper.\\nAll along, I was fearful that Carl would eventually test positive. He was high risk, and elder care facilities have acted as accelerators to COVID-19\\'s spread.\\nIn December, it finally happened. Another fateful call from the nurse.\\nCarl was sent back to the hospital for fever and symptoms. He tested positive for COVID-19 this time.\\nAmazingly, after a three day observation, Carl was deemed medically stable for discharge. He\\'d had fever and aches without the pulmonary involvement this time.\\nBecause of the number of cases at his facility, he had to first go into isolation in a skilled nursing facility — one used as a transition zone between the land of the sick and home.\\nWhile there on a Saturday, he began to decompensate. His oxygen saturation dropped, and he was sent back to the hospital.\\nI was able to converse with his bedside nurse, who told me he was struggling to breathe, but remained lucid. I was able to get there in time to say goodbye.\\nCarl was in a COVID-specific unit that had been commandeered from \\'regular\\' hospital use because of the pandemic.\\nHis bedside nurse was visibly pregnant. \"I\\'ve already had COVID,\" she told me.\\nCarl had clearly expressed his desire not to be intubated or have \\'heroic\\' measures taken to try to prolong his life. He and I had talked about it a lot after his prior hospitalization.\\nAll year the specter of COVID had hung over Carl. Over all of us. And now, with vaccines imminent, his number was being called.\\nIt was a cruel twist of chance and illness — one that will continue to play out over and over for at least much of 2021, as the pandemic continues its deadly march through America and most of the world.\\nI have no doubt that if Carl had been able to keep dodging coronavirus long enough to get vaccinated, he\\'d have been delighted to get immunized and have many more nights of cards to look forward to.\\nAs I stood by his bedside, Carl shook my gloved hand and said, \"Keep doing the good work you\\'re doing,\" knowing it would be the last time we spoke.\\nHe died a few hours later.\\nJust one of more than 343,000 Americans.\\nJohn Henning Schumann is a doctor and writer in Tulsa, Okla.

They can remain effective for up to 12 hours if left at room temperature. Beyond that, the drug is rendered useless.\\nDuring a teleconference Thursday, Chief Aurora Medical Group Officer Jeff Bahr told reporters that the former employee deliberately removed the vials from refrigeration on two separate occasions — on Dec. 24 overnight, then returning them to proper storage, and then again on Dec. 25 into Saturday morning.\\nA pharmacy technician discovered them outside the refrigerator on Christmas morning and immediately notified superiors, Bahr said.\\nAs a result, health care workers were forced to throw out about 570 doses of vaccine. However, some people were given the medicine that had been left out.\\nGrafton police detectives reported 57 patients received those injections. Bahr said those vaccines were rendered potentially less effective or altogether ineffective. The patients, who have been notified, are not at any risk of adverse health effects because the doses were left out, he noted.\\nThe pharmacist told investigators he knew \"that people who received the vaccinations would think they had been vaccinated against the virus when in fact they were not,\" officials said.\\nThe value of the spoiled doses is estimated to be between $8,000 and $11,000.\\nThe suspect is currently being held in the Ozaukee County jail.\\nNPR\\'s breaking news reporter Jaclyn Diaz contributed to this report.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

The country aims to vaccinate 25% of Israelis by the end of January. \\nThe vaccination drive began Dec. 19 with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu receiving the first shot on live TV. Israel so far is using the vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech and is awaiting a shipment of Moderna\\'s vaccine.\\nFigures compiled by Our World in Data, a website published by Oxford University, put Israel in the lead in vaccination doses administered per 100 people. But the country is behind China, the United States and the United Kingdom in the total administered as of Thursday.\\nBut Israel is not providing vaccines to Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank or in the Gaza Strip, which is blockaded by Israel and Egypt. Palestinian officials are scrambling to secure deals with vaccine manufacturers.\\nIn February, 3% of Palestinians in both territories are expected to be vaccinated through COVAX, an initiative co-led by the World Health Organization and a vaccines alliance to distribute COVID-19 vaccines more equally around the world, said Ali Abed Rabbo, director general of the Palestinian Health Ministry. That program pledges to eventually vaccinate 20% of the Palestinian territories, which have a combined population of about 5 million.\\nOn Wednesday, drugmaker AstraZeneca offered to sell the Palestinian Authority enough vaccines to cover an additional 20% of the territories\\' population in February, he said.\\nIsrael says the Palestinians are responsible for their own health care under the 1990s Oslo peace accords. Some aid groups say Israel and the Palestinian Authority both share responsibility.\\nAbed Rabbo said the Palestinian Authority only began approaching drugmakers in the last few weeks, long after other countries inked their own vaccine deals. The Palestinian Health Ministry official said a recently resolved Palestinian financial crisis, brought on by a months-long Palestinian Authority boycott of Israel, had left few funds for vaccines. Officials had expected to receive vaccines from Russia, but Russian officials Wednesday notified the Palestinian Authority they did not yet have enough supplies to offer.\\nIsrael\\'s vaccination bonanza — with inoculation stations open every day, including on the Sabbath, from a sports arena in Jerusalem to tents in Tel Aviv\\'s central square — is at the core of Prime Minister Netanyahu\\'s campaign for reelection in March.\\n\"Israel is the world champion in vaccines,\" Netanyahu said Tuesday. \"Maybe we will be the first country in the world to emerge from this coronavirus.\"\\nThe prime minister has said his new friendship with Pfizer\\'s CEO got Israel toward the front of the line. Israeli officials have indicated the country paid a higher price than other countries. One Health Ministry official told local media Israel paid $62 a dose, compared to the $19.50 price tag in the U.S. In a statement to NPR, the Israeli Health Ministry did not confirm how much it paid, citing the \"sensitivity of the subject,\" but Israeli Finance Minister Israel Katz said the higher price was necessary considering Israel was vying for vaccines among much larger countries.\\nIsraeli officials believe the country\\'s fast vaccination campaign could provide an early model for countries.\\n\"One of the reasons why Israel was given some of the vaccines [may be] so we can study in advance to see how such a big effort takes place,\" said Dr. Boaz Lev, who heads the Health Ministry\\'s advisory committee for prioritizing how COVID-19 vaccines are distributed.\\nOfficially, Israel\\'s four national health insurance companies are only vaccinating citizens over 60 years of age, health care workers and residents of psychiatric and geriatric institutions. But many younger Israelis, who are at lower risk of COVID-19 complications, have also found ways to get vaccinated.\\nSome clinics vaccinate younger Israelis in the evening so Pfizer vials removed from refrigeration do not go to waste, Lev said.\\nSome Israeli Jews have also found it easy to get vaccinated at clinics in Arab communities in Israel. Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel, who comprise about a fifth of the country, have been more skeptical of the vaccine.\\nNicole Schwartz, 27, accompanied her grandmother to get the vaccine Thursday, in the town of Sderot, and unexpectedly received one herself when she asked. She feels relieved after taking a year off work as a special education teacher out of concern she would catch the virus, but also guilty at how easily she as a young person got the vaccine.\\n\"I am unhappy with how political it is to bring the vaccines and do it so fast,\" Schwartz said. \"It\\'s important to [Netanyahu] that everyone will know that he brought the vaccines and he did it so fast and we are the first country.\"\\nSderot borders Gaza, where the medical system has struggled to cope with coronavirus infections.\\n\"No one talks about it in the news, and I don\\'t think that people that live in Sderot actually talk about it, but it\\'s not fair,\" Schwartz said about Israelis having vaccines before Palestinians in Gaza. \"There are people there.\"\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

When the company homed in, a startling finding appeared: company source code \"in a number of source code repositories\" had been accessed by hackers. \\nMicrosoft said the company\\'s source code was not altered by the attackers. \\n\"The account did not have permissions to modify any code or engineering systems and our investigation further confirmed no changes were made. These accounts were investigated and remediated,\" the company said. \\nDmitri Alperovitch, a cybersecurity expert and chairman of Silverado Policy Accelerator, a Washington-based think tank, said while the breach appears to be a \"serious issue\" and can potentially make it easier for attackers to uncover additional system flaws at Microsoft, the company\\'s worst fears were not realized. \\n\"This attack was not as bad as it could have been for Microsoft,\" Alperovitch said. \"If they had modified the source code, or used it to introduce new backdoors, since Microsoft has billions of users out there in pretty much every  organization around the planet, that would\\'ve been a very severe, very grave concern,\" he said. \"But that doesn\\'t appear to be the case.\"  \\nStill, what the hackers can still do with whatever proprietary data was gathered from Microsoft should keep officials on edge, according to David Kennedy, who runs the Ohio-based company TrustedSec LLC, which investigated the hack.\\n\"We trust the devices that we use. We trust our computers. We trust our phones that we\\'re using on a daily basis. And all of them have source code that runs on the devices,\" he said. \"My hope is that none of this was compromised in the process, but we just don\\'t know at this point.\"\\nMany facts remain unknown about how the cyberattackers targeted Microsoft. The company did not say what products the viewed source code was tied to, or how long the hackers were able to stay within its systems. \\n\"Is it Microsoft Cloud Services? Is it their Windows operating system? Is it Microsoft Office? That would be very helpful to know to understand what source code was accessed and what vulnerabilities may be in that source code now,\" Alperovitch said. \\nKennedy offered additional questions. \\n\"Does this impact authentication mechanisms and how usernames and passwords are protected? Are they in the operating system side of the house or future projects? These are key things we need to understand to know how deep this goes,\" Kennedy said. \"The more access they had, the greater potential damage there is in the future.\" \\nA Microsoft spokesman declined to comment beyond the company\\'s blog post, which noted that the hackers did not compromise customers\\' personal data, nor did the intruders harness the information it read to attack others. \\nMicrosoft downplayed the significance of the attackers reading its source code, saying, unlike other tech companies, its employees have an \"open source-like culture\" to viewing source code within the firm. \"So viewing source code isn\\'t tied to elevation of risk,\" the company said. \\nThat may be true, security expert Kennedy said, but having a group of malicious hackers reading a company\\'s source code at the direction of a foreign government is a completely different matter.\\n\"Those are typically trusted employees within an organization that have access to source code and aren\\'t looking at it from an adversary\\'s perspective,\" he said. \"This can be used later on to launch additional attacks.\"\\nInvestigators are still probing the far-reaching attack, which has been traced back to October and compromised 18,000 private and government users who inadvertently downloaded a tainted software update from the Texas firm SolarWinds. \\nU.S. agencies were compromised, including the departments of State, Treasury, Commerce, Energy and Homeland Security. \\nOfficials do not believe the intrusion penetrated any classified information, yet investigators remain concerned that other sensitive data could have been stolen. \\nBut, as expert Alperovitch noted, what exactly the suspected Russian hackers got away with is still a mystery. \\n\"This is just one more shoe to drop,\" he said. \"There will be many more in the coming months. We\\'ll learn about more victims, more data that was taken. So we\\'re just in the very early innings of this investigation.\" \\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

The most active hurricane season on record was just one of many challenges facing the oil industry this year — aside from the attention-grabbing crisis of the pandemic.\\nIt\\'s no surprise that the oil industry had a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad year. Oil powers the vast majority of the global transportation system, and the pandemic froze most of the world\\'s population in place. \\nBut set aside the pandemic. Ignore the collapse in demand. Forget about the time oil prices went negative. Look at everything else that happened this year, and — \\nWell. Oil still had a pretty terrible year. \\nBetween hurricanes, geopolitical rivalries, irate investors and climate pressures, oil producers faced a host of challenges that weren\\'t created by the coronavirus — and can\\'t be cured with a vaccine. \\nIn the Gulf of Mexico, the amount of oil production lost because of storms was about six times higher than the recent average, according to Sami Yahya, an analyst with S&P Global Platts.\\n\"The worst offender was Hurricane Delta, which cut Gulf of Mexico production by just about 92%,\" Yahya says. Then, just as the industry was about to recover from Delta, Hurricane Zeta swept in. (The names themselves are a sign of just how brutal this year was: So many powerful storms formed this year that, for just the second time, forecasters ran out of names and had to resort to Greek letters.)\\nMarkets didn\\'t react much because there was so much surplus oil that refineries didn\\'t see any interruption. But producers felt a hit. And while any given storm season may be an outlier, in general, global warming is expected to make hurricanes more powerful and destructive.\\nMeanwhile, U.S. shale producers were bracing for a brutal 2020 even before most Americans had heard of social distancing.\\n\"Prior to COVID — actually, days prior to the lockdowns — we had entered into a market share war,\" says Sarp Ozkan, a director of energy analysis at Enverus Market Intelligence. Russia and Saudi Arabia were slashing prices, each trying  to seize a larger slice of the global oil market. Not so coincidentally, those low prices were devastating for U.S. shale producers, whose explosive growth made the U.S. the top oil producer in the world. \\nA few years ago, the U.S. oil industry survived such a price war just fine. But back then, they had the support of investors eager to pour money into the U.S. oil patch. By last year — well before the pandemic — investors were getting increasingly frustrated. \\n\"Wall Street finally decided, \\'Hey, we\\'ve given you a lot of capital and you have sunk it into the ground. But we haven\\'t seen any of those returns that we\\'ve been expecting for a long time,\\' \" Ozkan says. Investors weren\\'t willing to put up more money until shale producers proved they could be profitable.\\nU.S. producers were starting to sweat. Then the coronavirus lockdowns rewrote the script for 2020, with the market share war replaced by a frantic struggle to stabilize crude prices.\\nToday, U.S. producers can point to the pandemic to explain their current woes. But in an alternate reality where the pandemic never happened, Ozkan argues the final outcome — companies merging and slashing investments, the entire U.S. industry shrinking — would be oddly unchanged.\\n\"Either way, I think we would have ended up with sort of the same sort of scenario,\" he says.\\nThen there\\'s the even bigger, more fundamental challenge for the industry: its future viability in a world fighting climate change.\\nThe pace of the \"energy transition\" — the shift away from carbon-emitting coal, oil and natural gas and toward zero-emission power sources, electric cars and electrified houses and even clean trucks, planes and ships — appears to be accelerating. \\nTo be clear, the world is not currently on track to meet its climate goals. It would take a massive transformation for the global economy to end its reliance on petroleum, which is woven throughout virtually every aspect of modern life.  But a growing number of powerful figures, including political leaders and business titans, are describing that shift not as idealistic but as urgent — even inevitable. \\nYou hear it from investors: At the beginning of this year, Larry Fink, the powerful CEO of BlackRock,  the world\\'s largest asset manager, said climate change would be at the heart of his firm\\'s investment strategy. By the end of it, JPMorgan Chase and the New York State pension fund announced plans to shift their investments away from carbon-emitting industries. A new activist investor group is pushing Exxon to pivot so it could still be profitable in a world weaning off oil. And as investment dollars pull back from oil and gas exploration, electric vehicle start-ups and renewable energy firms are soaring on Wall Street. \\nYou hear it from executives: This summer, European oil giants BP, Shell and Total warned that oil demand would peak soon, if it hadn\\'t already, and announced they were ramping up investments in renewables. Even producers who do not embrace renewables, such as many American oil companies, are voluntarily nodding to climate concerns in their earnings announcements. \\nAnd, perhaps most significantly, you hear it from regulators. This year China surprised the world with new, ambitious carbon targets. California, which exerts powerful influence over the U.S. auto industry, set a landmark law calling for zero-emissions semitrucks and  announced a future ban on new gas- and diesel-powered cars. Colorado set new, strict limits on methane emissions from oil and gas producers. Denmark ended new oil and gas exploration. \\nAnd, showing just how quickly sentiments are shifting, the U.K. accelerated its plans to prohibit the sale of gas- 0r diesel-powered cars not once but twice. In February, it moved the target from 2040 to 2035. Then, in November, it pushed it up to 2030. \\nAmy Myers Jaffe, managing director at the Climate Policy Lab at the Fletcher School at Tufts University, says these decisions were not triggered by the pandemic.\\n\"All these things I believe would still have happened,\" she says. \"They just intensified because of the collapse in oil demand, but all of those trends were coming.\" \\nFor oil companies, this creates a monumental challenge. They make multibillion dollar investments that won\\'t pay off for years. A drop in oil demand would make many of those investments unprofitable.

Margaret Kibben has been appointed chaplain for the U.S. House of Representatives. Kibben is the first female chaplain in either house of Congress.\\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi marked another milestone for women in Congress Thursday by appointing retired Navy Rear Adm. Margaret Grun Kibben as chaplain of the U.S. House of Representatives. Kibben is the first female congressional chaplain since Congress\\' founding in 1789.\\n\"Kibben brings decades of decorated experience in the military and the ministry, as a retired Rear Admiral who served as the U.S. Navy\\'s Chief Chaplain and the chaplain of the Marine Corps,\" Pelosi said in a statement. \"Her integrity, experience and patriotism will serve the Congress and the Country well, as she ministers to the needs of Members. \"\\nAs chaplain, Kibben will lead House members in a daily opening prayer as well as other ceremonies. The chaplain also provides pastoral counseling to House members, coordinates the scheduling of guest chaplains and arranges memorial services for House members and staff.\\nKibben was selected by a bipartisan committee of House members, whose recommendation was accepted by Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. She replaces retiring Rev. Pat Conroy, a Roman Catholic priest who has served as chaplain since 2011.\\nKibben\\'s military career spans more than 30 years. On top of her bachelor\\'s degree, Kibben received her doctorate of ministry and a master\\'s of divinity from Princeton Theological Seminary. She also studied national security and strategic studies at the Naval War College.\\nKibben also served with the Marine Corps in multiple chaplain positions, including Chaplain of the Marine Corps from 2010 to 2014. She has five deployments under her belt, including at least one to Afghanistan as senior chaplain. Most recently she served as a consultant with the Department of the Navy\\'s Sexual Assault and Prevention Office.\\nOver the course of her career Kibben received the Distinguished Service Medal, two Legion of Merit awards, the Bronze Star, three Meritorious Service medals and three Navy Commendation medals.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

And few foresaw how well it would end up.\\nHere are the highlights:\\nStocks in meltdown\\nBetween Feb. 12 and March 23, the Dow lost a stunning 37% of its value.\\nOn March 16 alone, the Dow plummeted nearly 3,000 points, losing 12.9%, as investors worried about the prospect of economic destruction wrought by COVID-19. The drop in stock prices was so large and so swift that it triggered multiple trading halts that day. In fact, the New York Stock Exchange suspended trading several times during those days.\\nThe worst-hit stocks were those affected by the travel restrictions, such as cruise lines, air carriers and energy companies. United Airlines stock fell to $24 in March after selling for $86 a share on Jan. 1. \\nHistoric recession\\nIt was a chilling time for investors, when the bottom seemed to be falling out of the global economy. Some 22 million jobs were lost in April and May in the United States as businesses were forced into lockdown mode.\\n\"The scope and speed of this downturn are without modern precedent, significantly worse than any recession since World War II,\" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on March 13.\\nThen a dramatic rebound\\nThen something surprising happened: The stock market rebounded. With a vengeance.\\nThroughout the summer and fall, prices began to creep up again, and by Aug. 18, the Standard and Poor\\'s 500 was hitting records again. And the Dow  crossed 30,000 for the first time ever on Nov. 24.\\n\"It\\'s a sacred number, 30,000,\" President Trump said at the White House. \"Nobody thought they\\'ll ever see it.\" \\nEven with all the tumult, the Dow finished the year up 7.2%, and the S&P 500 did even better, gaining 16.3%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite index, which is dominated by hot technology stocks, soared by a whopping 43.6%.\\nCongress, Fed and Treasury to the rescue\\nWhat on earth was going on? \\nThe Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department and Congress took quick, decisive action to support the economy during the worst of the meltdown. \\nCongress approved supplemental unemployment benefits and $1,200 stimulus checks that helped many of the hardest-hit Americans pay their rent and keep food on the table. And the U.S. Treasury got those checks out quickly.\\nThe Fed cut interest rates to near zero, and then stepped in with a broad $2.3 trillion package of lending programs to prop up households, employers, financial markets and local governments. \\n\"We are deploying these lending powers to an unprecedented extent [and] ... will continue to use these powers forcefully, proactively and aggressively until we are confident that we are solidly on the road to recovery,\" Powell said in April.\\nAll this sent a message to the financial markets: The Fed isn\\'t about to let you go under. Buoyed by those assurances, investors began dipping their toes back in the water.\\nTech bonanza\\nInitially, much of the market\\'s gains were driven by a few hot tech stocks, such as Amazon and Netflix, which benefited from the lockdowns, as online shopping took off and people who were stuck at home streamed plenty of movies. \\nNetflix ended the year nearly 64% for the year, Amazon more than 70%. \\n\"In terms of the broad economic changes, these companies are on the right side of history,\" says Lu Zhang, a professor of finance at the Fisher College of Business at Ohio State University. \\nTesla\\'s wild ride and a new centibillionaire\\nBut few stocks exploded in value as much as the electric-car maker Tesla, which rose more than 700% this year, eventually getting added to the S&P 500. Even founder Elon Musk, whose Tesla shares were worth so much he became a newly minted centibillionaire, complained in May that the price was too high. \\nIn fact, the stock market gains this year have made the rich a lot richer at a time when tens of millions of people are still struggling without jobs, and they have exacerbated the country\\'s wealth gap. \\nGeneration homebound and trading\\nSome part of the rebound — there\\'s debate about how much — was due to the explosive rise in online trading, with homebound investors filling their hours buying and selling stocks. \\nOnline brokerage companies such as Fidelity and Charles Schwab saw massive increases in trading volume. \\nThen there was the stock trading app Robinhood, with its 13 million customers, many of them young people with little experience trading. And many are especially attracted to high-gloss tech stocks such as Apple and Microsoft.\\nThese superstar tech stocks helped send the overall market higher. Apple\\'s market share even hit $2 trillion in August.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China, in Dec. 2019, and since then has quickly spread worldwide.\\nExactly one year ago today, the World Health Organization first learned of a cluster of a few dozen pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China of \"unknown\" origin. The cause, of course, would turn out to be the coronavirus behind the current pandemic. Here\\'s a by-the-numbers summary of the toll the virus has taken on countries across the globe since that fateful day.\\nFor the first two months of the pandemic nearly all reported cases were in China. But after a massive lockdown in Wuhan and other provinces, China quickly turned the corner. Today it has one of the world\\'s lowest casualty figures — with less than 100,000 reported cases and less than 5,000 deaths, according to statistics maintained by Johns Hopkins University.\\nAbout Goats and Soda \\nGoats and Soda is NPR\\'s global health and development blog. We tell stories of life in our changing world, focusing on low- and middle-income countries. And we keep in mind that we\\'re all neighbors in this global village. Sign up for our weekly newsletter. Learn more about our team and coverage.      \\nYet even as China gained control over its outbreak, the virus was spreading exponentially in countries on every continent of the planet. And nowhere has the toll been more severe than in the United States. Today the U.S. ranks highest when it comes to both its total reported case count of 19.7 million and its death toll of more than 342,000. Even when countries are ranked by reported cases as a percentage of their population, the U.S. ranks in the top five. And the U.S. also currently has the highest number of daily new reported cases and daily new deaths.\\nWhen considered in purely numerical terms, other hard-hit countries include India with 10.3 million reported cases, Brazil with 7.6 million, Russia with 3.1 million, France with 2.7 million, the United Kingdom with 2.4 million, Turkey with 2.2 million, Italy with 2.1 million, Spain with 1.9 million and Germany with 1.6 million. Practically all of these countries also rank in the top 10 on the number of deaths. Brazil, for instance, has had more than 193,000, India more than 148,000. And practically all are currently seeing the world\\'s highest numbers of new reported cases and deaths.\\nSeveral countries that don\\'t make it into the top 10 tallies of cases and deaths still bear mentioning. In the Americas for instance, Colombia and Argentina now have about 1.6 million reported cases a piece. Mexico, with 1.4 million, is close behind. And Mexico also has one of the world\\'s highest death tolls — with nearly 125,000 lives lost to date. In the Middle East, Iran has fared particularly poorly — with about 1.2 million cases and more than 55,000 deaths. And while it seemed for a time that African countries might escape the brunt of the pandemic, South Africa has now seen its total case count surpass 1 million.\\nThen there are nations where the case and death counts don\\'t look as serious — until they are considered as a share of the population. Countries where the virus has wrought this outsized impact include the Czech Republic, Belgium, Panama and Slovenia, where the caseload per capita ranges from 5,000 to 6,000 per 100,000 people — as well as, when it comes to deaths per capita, Peru, where 116 people per 100,000 have died.\\nChina is not the only nation that showed the coronavirus can be contained. Other standouts include South Korea, with about 60,000 cases and 900 deaths, and Vietnam, with 1,465 cases and just 35 deaths.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

She has risen through the ranks since then, joining Popovich on the front row of the sideline in 2018 when former Spurs assistant James Borrego left to become the Charlotte Hornets\\' head coach.\\nHammon, 43, was an All-Star guard in the WNBA, playing 16 seasons for the New York Liberty and San Antonio Stars as well as stints overseas.

The court\\'s new conservative supermajority puts the fate of Roe v. Wade in doubt.\\nFor the first time in nearly a half century, there is a six-justice conservative  supermajority on the U.S. Supreme Court â€” six justices with clearly expressed views against abortion rights. So, will a woman\\'s constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy soon be a thing of the past? \\nIn 1973, when the court issued its landmark Roe v. Wade opinion, the vote was 7-to-2, with five Republican-appointed justices in the majority. But since then, the court\\'s composition has moved inexorably to the ideological right, with the court\\'s three newest justices appointed by President Trump. \\nAt the same time, however, public opinion polls have showed large majorities supporting abortion rights in most cases. Those approval ratings have remained remarkably stable over the years. \\nOn the Supreme Court, however, the centrist conservatives are gone, replaced by justices more passionately opposed to the notion of a constitutional right to abortion. So the question now is: How fast and how far does the court want to move. \\nAmong constitutional scholars, there are basically two schools of thought. Many expect the court to systematically hollow out Roe v. Wade, not explicitly overturning it but leaving it a right on paper only.\\nIt will be \"like this sarcophagus of Roe that you have outside the tomb, but there\\'s nothing inside, just an empty shell,\" predicts professor Josh Blackman, of South Texas College of Law Houston. \\nBut NYU law professor Melissa Murray says the time is ripe for anti-abortion rights forces to strike more definitively.  \\n\"I think the galvanizing view within the pro-life movement is that the time has come to call the question,\" she says. \"Why wouldn\\'t you do it now when you have a 6-to-3 supermajority?\"\\n\"It is a new moment for the court,\" adds Mallory Quigley, a vice president of the anti-abortion rights Susan B. Anthony List. \"What the pro-life movement is doing is throwing every type of spaghetti at the wall and seeing what sticks.\"\\nAnti-abortion rights forces are in fact prevailing in many state legislatures, enacting lots of different laws that restrict abortion rights. As of now, there are four cases challenging those laws pending before the Supreme Court and more than a dozen cases pending in the federal appeals courts. \\nSome of those appeals in the lower courts have remained undecided for as many as 2 1/2 years, suggesting that some conservative-dominated lower courts are slow-walking cases in hopes of a dramatic change in abortion rulings from the Supreme Court.\\nAmong the restrictions involved in these cases are bans on abortions at early stages of pregnancy, with six states banning abortions after six weeks. That\\'s before many women even realize they are pregnant. Then, too, are bans on the most common method of surgical abortions. There are laws making it more difficult to obtain medical abortions using pills. There are laws making it illegal to terminate a pregnancy because of fetal abnormalities, including Down syndrome. And there are laws aimed at making it difficult to impossible for clinics that perform abortions to remain open.\\n\"What we\\'re ultimately hoping for is that the Supreme Court will take the handcuffs off state legislatures and allow them to enact laws that are truly reflective of the values of the people in those states,\" says Quigley of the SBA List.\\nAbortion-rights lawyers like Stephanie Toti know they are facing an uphill battle.  \\n\"Roe v. Wade has been settled precedent for nearly 50 years and yet everybody thinks that we might be on the cusp of that precedent being overturned,\" she says, adding it\\'s \"really important to keep up the fight,\" especially because the \"perspective that often gets lost\" is of people like the woman who suddenly finds herself pregnant and needing an abortion, only to discover that clinics are now closed.\\nIf the direction the conservative court is embarking on abortion is clear, it is less clear how the conservative justices will get there. NYU professor Murray  points to an idea promoted in one opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas that sought to link Planned Parenthood, contraception and abortion to the racist views of the eugenics movement in the early 20th century. \\nThough Thomas wrote only for himself in that case, Murray points out that  other conservative justices last year relied on the racist roots of laws permitting non-unanimous jury verdicts to strike them down. And she sees those opinions as \"opportunistically\" laying the groundwork for a different approach to reversing Roe.\\n\"What could be better than to take down Roe on the ground that it is not just wrong in terms of your moral view of where life begins, but it\\'s wrong because it\\'s about racial injustice?\"  Murray says.  \\nEven a year ago, the justice who would have pushed back most forcefully against that theory would have been the modern era\\'s foremost advocate for women\\'s legal rights and personal autonomy, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Her death just three months ago, and Trump\\'s appointment of Amy Coney Barrett to replace her, however, have solidified the conservative supermajority on the court. \\nAnd if you look carefully, as professor Murray observes, anti-abortion groups now routinely refer to laws banning abortion because of fetal abnormality as \"anti-discrimination laws.\"\\nA previous version of this story incorrectly said there are six cases challenging state laws related to abortion pending before the Supreme Court. There are currently four.\\nA previous version of this story incorrectly said there are six cases challenging state laws related to abortion pending before the Supreme Court.

China has approved Sinopharm\\'s vaccine after clinical trials showed it has a 79% efficacy against COVID-19.\\nChina\\'s medical products agency has given market approval to the country\\'s first COVID-19 vaccine, made by state-owned Sinopharm. The conglomerate says its vaccine has a 79% efficacy rate — surpassing the widely accepted standard of 50% efficacy.\\nThe approval is conditional, requiring Sinopharm to continue collecting data about the vaccine and its long-term effects. But the arrival of another mass-produced vaccine could provide relief in countries that have been unable to secure doses of the vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. China\\'s approval came one day after the U.K. approved a vaccine made by AstraZeneca and Oxford University.\\nThe Sinopharm vaccine uses inactivated coronavirus that causes the body to produce antibodies, a more conventional approach to inoculation. Pfizer\\'s and Moderna\\'s vaccines use a revolutionary gene-based platform.\\nThe Chinese vaccine requires two injections. It was created by a Sinopharm subsidiary, the China National Biotec Group, or CNBG. The drugmaker says it has been conducting clinical studies in China as well as in other countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Peru, Argentina and Morocco.\\n\"During the summer, Beijing gave a green light for emergency use of the Sinopharm vaccine and several others,\" NPR\\'s John Ruwitch reported for our Newscast unit. \"State media say that millions of doses have already been administered, including to front-line medical staff and people going abroad for work. Emergency use is set to expand.\"\\nBoth Bahrain and the UAE — where large-scale trials of the Sinopharm vaccine took place — approved the vaccine earlier this month.\\nChina\\'s new approval for widespread use moves the country closer to its goals of vaccinating millions more people in the coming months. To protect itself from COVID-19, China must vaccinate at least 700 million residents, CNBG Chairman Yang Xiaoming told Chinese state-run media.\\nYang also said that he and hundreds of other CNBG employees were inoculated with a version of the company\\'s vaccine in March — the same month COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic.\\nAlong with the efficacy rate, a vaccine\\'s ability to protect public health is tied to another figure: vaccine coverage — the number of people who get the shot and develop antibodies to the virus.\\n\"The percentage of people who need to have antibodies in order to achieve herd immunity against a particular disease varies with each disease,\" the World Health Organization says. It notes that for measles, around 95% of a population must be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, while for polio, the threshold is much lower: about 80%.\\nIn addition to those differences, a vaccine\\'s efficacy rate directly affects the amount of coverage a population must have to prevent or curtail an epidemic. Researchers have been studying how high an efficacy rate must be to protect the public without any other interventions.\\nOne study recently concluded that a vaccine \"has to have an efficacy of at least 70% to prevent an epidemic and of at least 80% to largely extinguish an epidemic without any other measures (e.g., social distancing).\"\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

All of the gear must be put on before entering the room, and taken off immediately after leaving.\\nWhen the coronavirus hit the U.S., hospitals issued strict limitations on visitors. Nurses and doctors started acting as liaisons to the sick and dying for family members not allowed at bedsides. As deaths reach new daily highs, that work is not getting any easier. The emotional toil of adapting to new dynamics with patients and families at one rural hospital in Livingston, Mont., is a case study of what health care workers are grappling with all over the country.\\nFramed by the rugged Absaroka Mountains in south-central Montana, Livingston HealthCare looks more like an upscale ski chalet than a medical facility. It\\'s one of more than 1,300 critical access hospitals in the U.S., which are federally designated to increase health care access in rural areas. Here, the hospital has 25 beds and serves a huge region — about twice the size of Rhode Island — but with a population just shy of 17,000.\\n\\n                Livingston HealthCare is one of more than 1,300 critical access hospitals in the U.S. Built in 2015, it serves an area twice the size of Rhode Island, home to about 17,000 people.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Nick Mott for NPR\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nLivingston HealthCare is one of more than 1,300 critical access hospitals in the U.S. Built in 2015, it serves an area twice the size of Rhode Island, home to about 17,000 people.\\nIt\\'s about an hour drive north of Yellowstone National Park, and the walls are dotted with images of trout and breathtaking vistas.\\nOn this windy, wintry mid-December day, three beds here are occupied by COVID-19 patients.\\nEnd-of-life care \\n\\n                Assistant Director of Nursing Jenn Schmid is in one of Livingston HealthCare\\'s two ICU rooms.

Before COVID-19, Schmidt\\'s job was mostly administrative — but she stepped in to fill the hospital\\'s need during the area\\'s coronavirus surges. One duty she took up was spending time with families as they said farewell to loved ones through the ICU\\'s glass windows.\\nJenn Schmid, the assistant director of nursing, is standing outside large windows that offer a view inside the hospital\\'s two ICU rooms. This is the epicenter of the pandemic in the hospital — where the worst cases are. The beds are empty and neatly made. Soft, yellow light is pouring in from outside. But a few weeks ago, the scene here would have looked very different. Over the past several months, cases in the area ebbed and flowed — and they were in the midst of the biggest spike they\\'d seen so far.\\n\"My job consisted of 24/7 begging people to try to come in to get help, coming in to try to staff it myself, just because we didn\\'t have enough nurses,\" Schmid says.\\nThe CDC recommends that hospitals limit visitation, especially during times of community spread. Figuring out how to do so requires balancing safety with the emotion and trauma faced by patients and their families.\\nHere, the hospital banned visitors, but there are exceptions. When patients near the end of their lives, their closest relatives are allowed to say their goodbyes from a distance — through those windows that look into the ICU. Schmid sat outside the room with families. She says that glass barrier between patients and their loved ones made farewells an even more emotionally devastating experience.\\n\"Having to sit out here with family and try to be their support and give them that affection or that caring when you yourself have to stay 6 feet away and they can\\'t see their dad or their husband for the last time and you have to watch that, it\\'s gut-wrenching,\" she says. \"And I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever get used to that. I\\'ve seen a lot of death and I\\'ve held multiple peoples\\' hands while they\\'re dying. But I\\'ve never had anything that has affected me like that. It\\'s so foreign.

When it became clear it was the end, the hospital brought the family into the ICU, where they could see Jerry through the window.\\nShe says nurses were at his side. They sang him songs to help him feel at ease, and helped relay what Schmidt and her family were saying.\\n\"[They were] trying to make him feel like he didn\\'t have to hold on anymore because he was so tired,\" she says.\\nSchmidt says Jerry passed peacefully on Nov. 15 after 12 days in the hospital. As we talk, it\\'s been one month, to the minute, since his death.\\nSchmidt\\'s thankful for the health care workers who made sure her husband felt less isolated.

You try to smile really hard so your eyes show it.

Instead of smiles and facial expressions, only their eyes — perched above an N95 — can show emotion and establish connection.\\n\"It makes me sick to my stomach thinking about that, like, so many people are dying alone and their nurse has maybe known \\'em or a couple of days is the last person they see,\" medical floor nurse Kristy Blaine says.\\nShe says she recognizes the emotional work it takes to keep patients feeling connected.\\n\\n                Travel nurse Michael Niynaku, tasked with treating COVID-19 patients for the day, at a nurses\\' station in front of baggies containing staff members\\' N95 masks.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Nick Mott for NPR\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nTravel nurse Michael Niynaku, tasked with treating COVID-19 patients for the day, at a nurses\\' station in front of baggies containing staff members\\' N95 masks.\\n\"You also, you know, feel bad for your patients because these Martians are coming in, looking so different,\" Blaine says. \"You know, you literally look like an alien and you\\'re trying to care for your patients, and they just feel like lepers.\"\\nBlaine does what she can to make the hospital feel less sterile for her patients. She keeps a squishy, pink-haired unicorn dangling from a keychain on her ID badge.

You know nurses always ask about poop.\"\\nBlaine says that for nurses, adaptability is part of the job description. With only eyes peering out behind a mask, that pooping unicorn is one way of bringing joy into a world of isolation.\\nLimits on visitations in hospitals across the country are unlikely to change much until this spring or summer, when vaccines are widely available. Until then, health care workers will continue to adapt, to innovate, and to find reasons to smile.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

He did it early and deposited his mail-in ballot in one of many drop boxes provided by his local election office in Miami-Dade County.\\n\"So early voting, drop box. Checked the supervisor of elections website a couple of days later and it was tabulated,\" he said. \"It worked swell.\"\\nThat was a relief for Nielsen, whose vote did not count in 2018. His ballot arrived too late, despite being mailed more than a week before Election Day. \\nNPR reported earlier this year that more than a half-million mail-in votes were rejected in the 2020 primaries for similar reasons. The ballots arrived too late or had missing or mismatched signatures.  \\nAnd with many more people voting by mail this fall, election officials feared that millions more ballots would be rejected in the general election.\\nIt didn\\'t happen. Instead, rejection rates went down across the country, in states such as North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio and Florida — although final numbers are still coming in.\\nDaniel Smith, a political scientist at the University of Florida, says that out of almost 5 million mail-in ballots cast in his state this fall, fewer than 9,000 were rejected, a much lower rate than in previous elections. \\nHe said it wasn\\'t because voters made fewer mistakes. \\n\"The rates of ballots being flagged for problems wasn\\'t any lower than in past elections. It\\'s just that individuals were able to cure their ballots in a timely fashion to make sure that their ballots would count,\" said Smith.\\nFixes and cures\\nAs in many other states, Florida made it easier this year for voters to fix, or \"cure,\" their ballots. For example, Florida\\'s mail-in ballot envelopes included space where voters could provide their email address or phone number, allowing election officials to contact them more quickly about mistakes, so they could be fixed on time. \\nThat change also provided crucial contact information for campaigns and interest groups, so they too could reach out to voters to make sure that their ballots counted. And indeed, many groups did just that, helping their supporters cure their ballots as part of aggressive get-out-the-vote campaigns. \\nJared Dearing, executive director of Kentucky\\'s board of elections, says his state also took steps to help absentee voters after more than 25,000 ballots were rejected in the June primary. Prior to the pandemic, only about 2% of Kentucky voters cast their ballots by mail, compared with 75% this year. There were some growing pains.\\n\"So what we tried to do is create 1) uniformity of process and 2) to give some pretty clear guidelines to the counties of what could be counted, what couldn\\'t be counted,\" said Dearing.\\nHe said some counties were discarding ballots for reasons that others did not, such as a voter signing the envelope in the wrong place. Under the new guidelines, such ballots would be accepted.\\nThe state also created an online portal where voters were able to apply for an absentee ballot, track its progress and be alerted of potential problems. That helped cut rejections dramatically, to about 2,500 votes in November. \\n\"Not waiting until the last day\"\\nDearing said something else added to the decline. He saw a monumental shift in voter behavior this year, as though all those warnings and news stories about tossed ballots and postal delays really sunk in. \\n\"For the first time, voters were not waiting until the last day to mail these things. They were all mailing them weeks ahead of time,\" he said.\\nAmber McReynolds, CEO of the National Vote at Home Institute and a former Colorado election official, saw another silver lining. She said the fact that so many ballots were rejected in the primaries helped voters learn how to do it right. Many of them were first-time absentee voters, in large part because of the pandemic. \\n\"It\\'s a teachable moment, right,\" she said. \"You get your ballot rejected, then you\\'re probably not going to make that mistake again.\"\\nIronically, some election officials think President Trump\\'s repeated attacks on mail-in voting as insecure also helped, by keeping the issue front and center. Voters heard over and over again how important it was to follow the rules.\\nMcReynolds hopes that states learn from this year\\'s experiences and find ways to make mail voting easier and more problem-free.  She said there were many good examples of states educating their voters about the process and potential pitfalls. Hawaii, for one, sent a card to every voter letting them know that election officials would use their signatures to validate mail-in ballots and giving voters a chance to update the one on record. Other states extended ballot receipt deadlines and gave voters more time to cure their ballots, sometimes as the result of litigation. \\nBut initial signs are not encouraging. Republican lawmakers in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona and elsewhere — citing Trump\\'s baseless claims that mail-in voting leads to widespread fraud — are already talking about ways to restrict absentee voting. If only, they say, to restore voter confidence in the system.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

But as 2020, a year defined by the coronavirus pandemic, comes to a close on Thursday, the government appears set to fall well short of that goal. \\nU.S. Army Gen. Gustave F. Perna, chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed, and Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser to federal vaccine effort, said the U.S. has deployed around 14 million vaccine doses as of Wednesday, but only 2.1 million people had received shots. Perna and Slaoui spoke on Wednesday during a news conference. \\nThe vaccination process started on Dec. 14 with frontline health workers getting the shots first. \\nThe number of people vaccinated as reported by Perna and Slaoui contrasts with data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of Thursday morning, the agency said that more than 12.4 million doses of Pfizer\\'s and Moderna\\'s two-dose vaccines had been distributed across the country. The CDC reports just 2.7 million people have been vaccinated. It has said, however, it is working with out-of-date data. \\nPerna said he is also working off of a 72- to 96-hour lag in vaccine reporting data, which he says will be adjusted as time goes on.\\nRegardless of the data used, Perna and Slaoui say the number of Americans vaccinated from the coronavirus is far lower than what they would like. \\n\"We know it should be better, and we are working hard to make it better,\" Slaoui said. \\nMore than 340,000 Americans have died from the pandemic, as of Thursday morning, according to Johns Hopkins University. Health officials warn that January could be the deadliest month since the start of the pandemic, making a successful vaccine distribution all the more critical. \\nThe vaccine rollout has been challenging, but officials expect that between Jan. 8 and Jan. 15, access to vaccines will greatly increase, Perna said. \\nDespite the early hiccups, Perna and Slaoui applauded the multipronged effort involving states and local governments, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies and delivery companies to get the immunization program rolling. \\nPresident Trump criticized state officials for the lag in a tweet this week and urged states to, \"Get moving!\"\\nThe Federal Government has distributed the vaccines to the states. Now it is up to the states to administer. Get moving!\\nNews of the lag in vaccinations comes as reports of problems with state-level distribution processes trickle out. \\nFlorida\\'s county-by-county plan to vaccinate the state\\'s elderly residents created a scramble earlier this week. CNN reported that a southwest Florida county encouraged anyone 65 and older and high-risk frontline health care workers to come to one of its seven vaccination sites â€” no appointment necessary. Each location only had 300 doses, leading to overwhelmed health centers and residents camping out for several hours to get their shots.\\nIn Wisconsin, a medical center employee intentionally left 57 vials of the Moderna vaccine out of its cold storage, leaving health officials with no choice but to destroy them. The vials could have provided around 500 doses. \\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

Unlike her immediate predecessors in the Trump administration, Jen Psaki plans to take questions from reporters each day.\\nPsaki has played similar roles before. She was the spokesperson for the State Department when John Kerry was secretary of state, then President Barack Obama\\'s communications director, and she now speaks for Biden.\\n\"I think more than any point in history ... part of the job of the White House press secretary is to rebuild trust with the American people,\" she says in an interview with NPR\\'s Morning Edition.\\nPresident Trump\\'s first press secretary falsely claimed the biggest inauguration crowd in history. His last made false claims about Trump\\'s election defeat. Psaki promises to be \"as fact-based as I can be.\" She says she won\\'t limit right-wing media outlets\\' access to White House briefings but adds that \"we\\'re not going to allow the briefing room to be a platform for propaganda.\"\\nHere are highlights of the interview, edited for length and clarity:\\nThere\\'s always a tension, of course, in this job, and it\\'s been highlighted in the last few years as to who you\\'re supposed to serve. You\\'re, of course, working for a president, you\\'re getting out the message of the president. But as reporters will be quick to point out, you\\'re on the public payroll and they see your job as working for them or really working for citizens, informing the public. As you see it, who is your boss?\\nOf course, it\\'s an honor to be speaking on behalf of the U.S. government, but my boss is really the American people and there are different entities who are kind of serving the American people. Right? Of course, the president of the United States was elected by them. But the media plays an essential role, too. Right? And that may mean and it will mean, as you know — you\\'ve been in that briefing room — on days we disagree, right, we\\'ll have failures or we\\'ll have things that are mishandled in the government. But, you know, my view is, especially at this moment in history and in a moment where people don\\'t trust the information they\\'re getting from most sources, is to be as steady and as fact-based as I can be.\\nHow do you think you will engage the right-wing media ecosystem, if I can call it that? I\\'m thinking of networks like Fox, but also OANN and Newsmax that have larger and larger audiences. And some of them, like Fox, have, at least on a basic level, acknowledged that Joe Biden won the election. Others are pushing completely discredited theories, but they\\'re all going to be there. They\\'re all going to have an audience, and they\\'re all going to have questions for you.\\nThat\\'s right. And you know, Steve, again, just to go back to how valuable I find and how much I\\'ll rely on my experience at the State Department, there were many, many days where there were journalists — I\\'m air quoting that — who are from Russia or China, essentially arms of the government, you know, arms of the state-run media. And we let them in the briefing room, and they ask questions, and sometimes I had a little fun with them, you know, about who they were asking the question on behalf of.\\nThe first interview that I did after I was announced as White House press secretary was with Chris Wallace on Fox. I do think there is a difference, as I think everybody knows, between some of the anchors and reporters at a network like Fox and some of the personalities. I will not be doing an interview with Sean Hannity. I think that wouldn\\'t serve anybody, including the president-elect, who\\'s the most important factor there. In terms of, you know, [OANN] and kind of other right-wing entities? I don\\'t think my job as the White House press secretary is to give them a bigger platform. But at the same time, when we\\'re at a point when it\\'s COVID-safe and there is a full briefing room, I also don\\'t think it\\'s my job to keep people out.\\nThere seemed to be different approaches at different times in the Obama administration to this question. Of course, President Obama himself did interviews from time to time on Fox News, but the administration also grew frustrated with Fox, tried to shut them out from time to time, was criticized for that. Do you feel that that question is resolved in the way that you just said?\\nYou know, Steve, it\\'s a good question. I don\\'t think it\\'s resolved, no. And I will tell you, my resting place is to be steady and open and share information. But I am no pushover either. We\\'re not going to allow the briefing room to be a platform for propaganda, and we will shut that down as needed as well.\\nThere was an astonishing amount of leaking to the media during the Trump administration. And of course, if you\\'re a critic of Trump, you would argue that was mostly for the public good. Thank goodness we found out what was going on in there might be your attitude. But how do you mean to approach leaks in a Biden administration?\\nI\\'ve told some journalists this, anybody who covered only the Trump administration who\\'s looking for a continuation of the Game of Thrones-style personnel sniping, they will be sorely disappointed, I believe. Our goal is for there to be a return to policy processes and policy briefings and policy experts who are going to be out there explaining what a COVID package may look like or what we\\'re going to do about immigration. And certainly there are leaks around that which may give me a headache for the day, but are not as damaging, I would say, as leaks that are around people\\'s lives or national security issues.\\nI\\'m glad you mentioned national security, because as you know well, President Obama\\'s administration aggressively prosecuted leakers of classified information and that spilled over into investigating journalists, obtaining journalists\\' phone records, tracking their comings and goings from government agencies. Does this administration mean to do the same?\\nObviously, there are different circumstances, as you well know, that came up during the Obama administration. And a number of those were overseen by the Department of Justice at the time. President-elect Biden has not even selected an attorney general yet. Believe me, people want to know who it\\'s going to be. But one of his priorities is returning that department to an independent department, one that does not have political influence from the White House, which will be quite a sea change from our current circumstance. And I suspect those will be questions that future nominee for that role will be asked in a confirmation hearing.\\nJeevika Verma, Jacob Conrad and Scott Saloway produced and edited the audio version of this story.

Bush administration.\\n\"A big difference in my time here, the first time and the second time, is the rise of a nation state threat actors and in particular, their use of cyber to protect their nation state interests and their power,\" Demers said. \"So it\\'s fitting, I think, that we began with a significant election interference hack ... and then here we are at the end dealing with a different kind of cyber activity.\"\\nThis year a number of U.S. government agencies, including the State Department and the Pentagon, have been compromised by another vast intrusion. Demers said he agrees with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\\'s statement that Russia appears to be behind the breach.\\nThe government is still scrambling to understand the breadth of the damage, Demers said, but so far it appears to be limited to the unclassified systems.\\n\"A lot still to be analyzed in terms of both the scope and depth of this hack,\" he said. \"But as you know, there\\'s a lot of confidential and sensitive information that is transmitted and stored on unclassified systems, a lot of information that would be of interest to a foreign state who was trying to learn about our intentions and our planning.\"\\nAn adversary not only can snoop on what a government agency is doing that\\'s not classified but also not public. It also can pair what it learns with what it\\'s gleaning from other sources, including related to secret information or from human spies.\\nFrom what he\\'s seen so far, Demers said the hack appears to be different from Russia\\'s cyberattack and social media campaign against the 2016 U.S. election, when the Kremlin wanted to sow chaos and undermine American democracy.\\n\"This looks more like what a nation state would traditionally try to do through human means, through spies, but trying to do it through technical means and cyber intrusions,\" he said.\\nChina, China, China\\nWhile Russia has grabbed headlines for much of the Trump administration, Demers spent a lot of his time and energy on another foreign adversary — China.\\nTrump administration officials have tagged China as the primary long-term threat to the United States. U.S. officials have accused China of waging a relentless campaign to steal American intellectual property, government secrets and academic information to try to supplant the U.S as the world\\'s preeminent power.\\nTo try to counter that threat, the department launched what it calls the China Initiative. Demers has led that effort, and from that depth of knowledge he says China stands alone in its plundering of American corporate secrets.\\n\"We do see some other countries engaging episodically in economic espionage, but none of them on the scale and sophistication and persistence of the Chinese government,\" he said.\\nRussia, for example, also has tried to steal sophisticated technology that is used in military equipment, and the Justice Department has charged such cases.\\nChina\\'s economic theft, in contrast, is much broader than that, and targets everything from biotechnology to engineering and aerospace.\\n\"It really is an effort to develop the Chinese economy and Chinese companies under this rubric of rob, replicate and replace,\" he said.\\nIt\\'s an accusation that Demers and other U.S. officials have made before --allegations that China denies.\\nU.S. officials say the Chinese steal the technology, replicate the product and then aim to replace the American or European company first in China\\'s market and then on the global market.\\nThe scale of the problem is reflected in the Justice Department\\'s workload.\\nEighty percent of the department\\'s industrial espionage cases involve the Chinese government, while two-thirds of its trade theft cases involve a Chinese company, Demers said.\\nIn the past few years alone, the Justice Department has unsealed one indictment after another related to China.\\nProsecutors have charged American and Chinese researchers and business people for allegedly stealing everything from high-tech wireless design to turbine technology.\\nThe government also has brought cases against U.S. academics for failing to disclose ties to the Chinese government. The prime example of that is an indictment against the chair of Harvard University\\'s chemistry and chemical Biology Department.\\nAnd then there are the cases of political espionage. At least three former U.S. intelligence officers have been convicted of spying for China, while a fourth is facing charges of doing so.\\nThe department\\'s crackdown hasn\\'t brought an end to China\\'s efforts, and it won\\'t. But that doesn\\'t mean it isn\\'t having an effect, Demers said.\\n\"These prosecutors are not silver bullets that are going to make the problem go away,\" he said. \"The Chinese are persistent. The will is there and the resourcing is there. But we\\'re going to call attention to and we\\'re going to shine a light on it and we\\'re going to make their job harder and harder.\"\\nDisrupting tradecraft \\nThe indictments do so, he says, by disrupting China\\'s activities. He pointed to the case of a Chinese intelligence officer who was extradited to the U.S. from Belgium in 2018 for allegedly trying to steal jet fan blade designs from GE Aviation.\\n\"The significance of that wasn\\'t just a disruption of that avenue of economic espionage,\" Demers said. \"The other significance was making the Chinese think twice — and more than twice — about using Europe as a safe place to meet Americans who they were trying to co-opt.\"\\nChinese intelligence officers don\\'t like coming to the U.S. for clandestine work because of the chance of arrest, while Americans considering providing sensitive information to the Chinese often are reluctant to travel to China early on in their relationships with handlers, Demers said. For that reason, Europe often served as a mutually acceptable place for them to meet.\\nDemers said the arrest and extradition from Belgium sent a signal to the Chinese intelligence services that Europe was no longer a safe place for such operations, which was \"very important in terms of disrupting their tradecraft.\"\\nAs Demers\\' time winds down at the DOJ with the looming change in administration, he said he expects his successor will build on what he\\'s done much as Demers built off of his predecessors.\\nThere are two areas — both related to China — that he\\'d focus on if he were sticking around.\\nOne is finding a way to better protect Chinese students at U.S. universities from what he calls \"surveillance and intimidation by their own government.\"\\n\"I think that\\'s an issue we need to look at. I know that\\'s an issue that a number of universities have paid careful attention to,\" he said.\\nThe other, he said, is on China\\'s foreign influence efforts, which are focused on swaying U.S. policy makers to allow China to pursue its interests at home and abroad, such as silencing criticism of Beijing\\'s actions in Hong Kong or Tibet.\\n\"We see them less sort of broadly thinking that they need to undermine democracy and more specifically, focusing on issues that are near and dear to their hearts and not tolerating any criticism of their behavior.\"\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

Owners have turned to these as a lifeline that can help fill some tables by offering the possibility at least of a safer dining experience.\\n\"We\\'re trying to do everything we can to expand the outdoor dining season for as long as possible,\" says Mike Whatley with the National Restaurant Association.\\nDire times have forced the industry to find ways to survive. Whatley says more than 100,000 restaurants are either \"completely closed or not open for business in any capacity.\" A recent survey by his organization found that the number of restaurants offering outdoor dining fell from 74% in early September to 52% in late November.\\n\"It\\'s going to be a hard and tough winter,\" Whatley says. \"As you see outdoor dining not being feasible from a cold-weather perspective, or, unfortunately, from a government regulations perspective, you are going to see more operators going out of business.\"\\nIn recent months, many cities and states have imposed a raft of restrictions on indoor dining, given the high risk of spreading the virus in these crowded settings.\\nMany have capped occupancy for dine-in restaurants. Some halted indoor dining altogether, including Michigan and Illinois. Others have gone even further. Los Angeles and Baltimore have halted indoor and outdoor dining. Only carryout is allowed.\\nThose who can serve customers outdoors, on patios or sidewalks, are coming up with creative adaptations that can make dining possible in the frigid depths of winter.\\nUrging diners and servers to embrace the \\'\\'yurtiness\\'\\' \\nWashington state shut down indoor dining in mid-November and has kept that ban in place as coronavirus cases continue to surge.\\nOn a blustery December evening, servers at the high-end Seattle restaurant Canlis are huddled together in the parking lot, clad in flannel and puffy vests, while their boss Mark Canlis gives a pep talk ahead of a busy night.\\nThere\\'s a wide spectrum. The safest that we\\'re talking about is no walls — a roof. And then the worst is fully enclosed.\\nRichard Corsi, air quality specialist, Portland State University\\n\"The hospitality out here is exactly the same as it is in there,\" Canlis says, gesturing to his restaurant, which overlooks Lake Union. \"But that looks really different, so try to invite them into the \\'yurtiness\\' of what we are doing.\"\\nCanlis has erected an elaborate yurt village in the parking lot next to his family\\'s storied restaurant.\\nIt includes an outdoor fireplace and wood-paneled walkways winding between small pine trees and the circular tents. The assemblage of yurts, with their open window flaps, is the Canlis family\\'s best effort to keep fine dining alive during the pandemic and a typically long and wet Seattle winter (referred to locally as the \"Big Dark.\")\\nArriving guests are greeted with a forehead thermometer to take their temperature and a cup of hot cider.\\n\"It gives us an excuse to think differently,\" Canlis says of the outdoor dining restrictions.\\nThe yurts not only shield diners from the elements but also from infectious airborne particles that might otherwise spread among different tables of guests.\\nDining inside such structures is not risk free: Guests could still catch the virus from a dining companion as they sit near each other, without masks, for a prolonged period of time. But Canlis says there is no easy way to determine whether every member of a dining group is from the same household.\\n\"I\\'m not the governor or the CDC,\" he says. \"I\\'m assuming if you are there at the table, you\\'re taking your health into your own hands.\"\\nThere are new rules, crafted during the pandemic, for outdoor dining structures in Washington that have required Canlis to consider issues such as how to ventilate the yurts properly and sanitize the expensive furniture.\\n\"What is the square inch of yurt volume space? What is the size of the door and the windows? How many minutes will we allow the yurt to \\'breathe?\\' \" Canlis says.\\nThe structures get cleaned after each dining party finishes a meal and leaves; during the meal service the waiters enter and leave quickly, wearing N95 masks.\\nIgloos, domes and tents: Just how safe are they? \\nAnother, more modern-looking take on outdoor dining involves transparent igloos and other dome-like structures that have become popular with restaurant owners all over the country.\\nTim Baker, who owns the Italian restaurant San Fermo in Seattle, had to order his igloos from Lithuania and assemble them by hand with the help of his son.\\nHis restaurant\\'s policy is that only two people are allowed in an igloo at a time, to cut down on the risk of those from different households gathering together.\\n\"You\\'re completely enclosed in your own space with somebody in your own household. These domes protect you from all the people walking by, on the sidewalk, and the server doesn\\'t go in with you,\" he says.\\n\\n                Tim Baker, owner of Seattle\\'s San Fermo, holds a hot air cannon he uses inside the dining igloos ahead of each seating.

And then the worst is fully enclosed — which is essentially an indoor tent — especially if it doesn\\'t have really good ventilation and good physical distancing.\"\\nIn fact, Corsi says some outdoor dining structures that are enclosed and have lots of tables near each other end up being more dangerous than being indoors, because the ventilation is worse.\\nDining that is truly outdoors, with no temporary shelter at all, is much safer because there are \"higher air speeds, more dispersion and more mixing than indoors,\" Corsi says, which means that respiratory droplets harboring the virus don\\'t accumulate and are less concentrated when people are close to each other.\\n\"If they have heaters, then you\\'re going to actually have pretty good ventilation,\" Corsi says, \"The air will rise up when it\\'s heated, and then cool air will come in.\"\\nHe says private \"pods\" or \"domes\" can be fairly safe if they are properly ventilated and cleaned between diners. That also assumes that everyone eating inside the structure lives together, so they have already been exposed to each other\\'s germs.\\nBut Corsi says he is still not going out for a meal in one of the many new outdoor dining creations — \"even though I know they\\'ve got a much lower risk\" of spreading COVID-19 than most indoor alternatives.\\nThis story comes from NPR\\'s health reporting partnership with Kaiser Health News.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

Samuel Little had confessed to 93 murders in more than a dozen states over 35 years.\\nSamuel Little, a convicted murderer who the FBI says is the most prolific serial killer in U.S. history, died Wednesday at age 80.\\nLittle was serving three consecutive life-without-parole sentences for the deaths of three women in the late 1980s in Los Angeles, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said in its announcement of his death.\\nLittle died at 4:53 a.m. An official cause will be determined by the Los Angeles County medical examiner's office. \\nIn 2018, Little confessed to the murder of 93 women nationwide from the 1970s through 2005. The FBI says it believes all of his confessions are credible. \\nSince then, law enforcement officers from around the U.S. have tried to connect details of his confessions to unsolved homicides in their regions. They had verified at least 50 of Little's murder confessions as of last year. \\nWork continues on corroborating more than 40 other cases, an effort that is likely to become more difficult now that Little is dead. \\nLittle's victims and crimes\\nLittle was convicted in 2014 for the murder of the three women killed in Los Angeles in the 1980s, after he was extradited to California from Kentucky on a narcotics charge.\\nOnce in custody for the drug charge, detectives collected DNA from Little that tied him to three unsolved homicides from 1987 and 1989. In all three cases, the women were beaten and strangled, and their bodies were dumped in an alley, a dumpster and a garage, the FBI said. It became Little's modus operandi throughout his 35-year killing spree. \\nLittle's life of crime started when he dropped out of high school and left his home in Ohio in the 1950s. He lived a nomadic life, getting by through stealing, selling his loot and using the money for drugs and alcohol. He had frequent run-ins with police but was often let go after a short stint in jail, the FBI said. \\n\\n                Samuel Little lived a nomadic lifestyle, often stealing to get money for drugs and alcohol.

Their bodies, if they were found, typically went unidentified, and their murders were not carefully investigated.\\nLittle's method of killing — strangulation — didn't always leave reliable signs for local police to determine whether the woman's death was a homicide. The FBI said he usually stunned or knocked out his victims before strangling them, thus leaving no signs of a struggle.\\nLaw enforcement investigation\\nLittle first confessed to the murders in 2018 when he was interviewed by Texas Ranger James Holland. Holland was investigating an unsolved homicide in Odessa, Texas, at the time. Little shared details of the killings because he sought to move prisons and offered information as a deal with police. It's unclear why he wanted a prison transfer or if detectives agreed to make that deal or if Little shared information separate from any agreement with law enforcement. \\nHis confessions touched off a nationwide effort to confirm that Little was tied to  unsolved killings in more than a dozen states. Over the course of almost two years, Little shared detailed information about each of his victims, how he killed them and the general location of their bodies. \\nLittle also drew incredibly detailed pictures of his victims, which the FBI has used to help solve the murders. The FBI created a webpage listing the details Little shared with detectives, his drawings, where he believes each woman was from and Little's videotaped confessions. \\nDetectives hope that with the public's help and the information from Little, they can resolve the remaining 40 unresolved cases.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor\",\n",

Yet President Trump\\'s appointee has sparked an internal outcry by taking bold steps to try to cement his control over at least two of the networks and shape the course of their journalism well into the Biden administration.\\nPack, the CEO of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, also serves as chairman of the boards of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia.

They could be removed only \"for cause\" subsequently. Pack stocked those boards with conservative activists and Trump administration officials, despite a tradition of bipartisanship.\\nIn other words, although President-elect Joe Biden has already signaled he intends to replace Pack as CEO of the parent agency soon after taking office in January, Pack would maintain a significant degree of control over the networks. Pack and USAGM declined requests for comment.\\nNPR has reviewed the language of the contracts, which have yet to be signed by the new presidents of the two networks — both of whom were appointed by Pack this month. The Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty contract was slated to be approved on Wednesday but appears to have been withdrawn from consideration after internal objections and inquiries from congressional aides, NPR and other media. It is unclear what the future holds for the initiative from Pack.\\nA group of more than two dozen senior officials from Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, including Editor-in-Chief Daisy Sindelar, wrote Pack in sharp protest on Wednesday. The group said in a statement obtained by NPR that Pack\\'s actions \"will compromise the freedom from political influence that for seven decades has characterized Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) as an independent surrogate news organization for countries with no free press of their own.\" (News of the statement was first reported by CNBC.)\\nRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty leaders argue that the CEO over their parent agency, Michael Pack, is seeking to politicize the network and retain control even after President-elect Joe Biden takes office.\\nThe proposed shift in the board is intended to revoke the network\\'s autonomy, they wrote, representing \"precisely the kind of political power maneuver that RFE/RL regularly witnesses in places like Russia, Hungary, Belarus, and Tajikistan. We never thought we\\'d see it from our own oversight agency.\" The statement was signed by regional directors, the head of its central newsroom and the heads of almost all its language services. The letter was also sent to congressional leaders, an inspector general and the head of Biden\\'s transition team for the global broadcasting agency.\\nThe reaction of the new president of Radio Free Asia, Stephen Yates, to the proposed contract is not known. Yates is a former national security aide to former Vice President Dick Cheney who later served as the head of the Idaho Republican Party.\\nRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reaches more than 40 million people each week in 27 languages across 23 countries, including Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, Russia and Ukraine. Radio Free Asia reaches audiences in China, Myanmar, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and North Korea as a \"surrogate broadcaster.\" The networks hire local journalists to provide independent coverage in those countries where a free press is repressed or not viable.\\nIn August, pro-democracy protesters in Belarus chanted \"Radio Svaboda,\" the name of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty\\'s service there since 1954, in a rebuke to the nation\\'s dictatorial president and the state media as evidence grew of rigged elections there. Radio Free Asia\\'s reporting on the repression of Muslim Uighurs by Chinese authorities helped bring the issue to the world\\'s attention.\\nThe stakes for the broadcasters are not merely matters of principle. In Russia, authorities are seeking to discredit Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty by branding its journalists as foreign agents. In Belarus, the regime has stripped RFE/RL\\'s journalists of standard accreditation and protections.\\nThrough the U.S Agency for Global Media, the federal government owns Voice of America and another broadcaster serving Cuba. The agency additionally funds Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks, which are technically independent nonprofit corporations funded through USAGM. Their corporate boards, appointed by USAGM\\'s CEO, approve hirings and firings. They also help guide the overall course and priorities of the networks.\\n\"This appears to be a blatant attempt by Michael Pack to federalize and politicize networks that Congress has repeatedly stated in statute should be nonpartisan and free from day-to-day government control,\" Jamie Fly, former president of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, told NPR. \"As the Kremlin and other authoritarian regimes target RFE/RL journalists, his actions continue to put journalists at greater risk and compromise their mission.\" Fly, a former adviser to Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., was fired by Pack this past summer.\\nThis story is based on conversations with six people inside USAGM and three former USAGM staffers; they spoke on condition that they not be named because of the wave of firings and suspensions initiated by Pack since his arrival in June. NPR was not able to confirm whether USAGM reached a similar contract with the board for the Middle East Broadcasting Networks.\\nPack arrived in June after a rocky two-year confirmation battle.\\nMuch coverage of Pack\\'s brief tenure has focused on his frontal assault on USAGM\\'s leadership and the independence of Voice of America, publicly attacking its reporting, questioning whether it harbored foreign spies and instigating investigations for perceived anti-Trump bias by its reporters. This month, he named a former U.S. State Department official who briefly served as director of the VOA under President George W. Bush to lead the network once again. The new director, Robert R. Reilly, declared his personal views irrelevant to his job after reports on his strongly held views against gay marriage and what he perceives as the intellectual collapse of Islam. This week, Pack named a State Department official without experience in journalism to be VOA\\'s deputy director.\\nNow Pack appears to be seeking to consolidate control anew by deploying bureaucratic language. In the past, the boards were made up of the same people as the primary board overseeing the agency, then called the Broadcasting Board of Governors. (His predecessor, John Lansing, is now CEO of NPR.) Pack was the first CEO to receive Senate confirmation under the agency\\'s new configuration, which dissolved the parent agency board.\\nAlong with Pack, the network boards he appointed include Jonathan Alexandre, senior counsel to the conservative Christian evangelical group Liberty Counsel Action, which has been active against gay and trans rights and which has supported Trump\\'s baseless claims of widespread voter fraud in 2020; financier turned Trump White House aide Robert Bowes; Bethany Kozma, a senior aide at the U.S. Agency for International Development who is an anti-trans activist and is reportedly under investigation for violations of the Federal Records Act; Rachel Semmel, the communications director for the White House\\'s Office of Management and Budget; and Emily Newman, Pack\\'s former chief of staff at USAGM. She most recently joined the legal team filing suit on Trump\\'s behalf to overturn the 2020 election results.\\nSuch boards are typically filled with bipartisan support and people who have expertise in journalism or the regions covered by the networks. Pack dismissed all those boards in June. In October, a District of Columbia Superior Court judge rebuked Pack for wiping away those boards. Judge Shana Frost Matini said Pack acted illegally in the case by replacing the board of a USAGM-subsidized fund that was set up to underwrite technology that enables people living under repressive regimes to access the Internet and communicate securely and privately, including via the tools Tor and Signal. Matini ruled that only the previous board had the right to change the fund\\'s leadership or reconstitute itself. Pack did not act to reinstitute the prior boards.\\nThe Biden transition team did not comment but has said its officials are not receiving expected coordination from the Pack team to ensure a smooth handover. This month, Pack has sought to dismiss senior executives he suspended over the summer, prompting USAGM\\'s general counsel, David Kligerman, to resign instead.\\nDisclosure: This story was reported by NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik and edited by NPR chief business editor Pallavi Gogoi.

This is something that\\'s expected,\" Fauci said. He added there is \"no indication that it increases the virulence\" of the infection any more than the variant that has been present in the U.S. since February. Nor is there any evidence it can evade \"the protection that\\'s afforded by the antibodies that are induced by vaccines.\" \\nBritish scientists identified the variant publicly earlier this month, and it has now spread in the U.K. and to other countries.\\nThe soaring number of coronavirus cases in California has stretched many hospitals beyond capacity, with some reporting they are out of intensive care unit beds and ventilators, and are turning away arriving ambulances. As a result, state officials on Monday instructed hospital leaders to prepare for the possibility of implementing \"crisis care\" guidelines, which means rationing treatment, medicine and supplies. \\nA day later, the state\\'s top health official announced an extension of lockdown restrictions for nearly half of California counties, including Los Angeles and others in the San Joaquin Valley. \\nEarlier on Wednesday, Newsom laid out a plan to phase in in-person learning in 2021, starting with students below kindergarten age. He also allocated $2 billion in the proposed budget to help with coronavirus testing, personal protective equipment and other supplies as schools reopen. \\nNewsom explained the recommendation is science-based, relying on evidence indicating children are less likely to acquire the virus in school than in their communities. He also noted increased benefits from in-person instruction, particularly for the youngest students.\\n\"As a father of four, I know firsthand what parents, educators and pediatricians continue to say: In person is the best setting to meet not only the learning needs but the mental health and social-emotional needs of our kids,\" Newsom said. \\nDuring the joint virtual news conference, Fauci acknowledged the delivery and dissemination of COVID-19 vaccines have fallen behind the expected timeline set by leaders of the federal government\\'s Operation Warp Speed. But he remains confident that \"we are going to gain momentum to be able to catch up.\"\\n\"By the time we get to the early fall, we will have enough good herd immunity that we will be able to get to some semblance of normality,\" he said. \\nFauci expects herd immunity will be achieved when 70% to 85% of the U.S. population has been vaccinated. \\n\"I believe strongly that if we pull together as a nation, public health measures seriously and uniformly, I believe that we can crush this outbreak within this time frame,\" he added before signing off. \\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

The two sources familiar with the debate sought anonymity to detail internal White House deliberations.\\nTrump signed a proclamation in June suspending entry to non-U.S. citizens who \"present a risk to the U.S. labor market following the coronavirus outbreak.\"\\nAmong those are holders of high-skilled H-1B visas, used in the tech industry, as well as executive L-1 visas and certain J-1 visas used by au pairs. The measure was aimed at applicants for new visas.\\nThe proclamation was actually an extension of Trump\\'s earlier \"Buy American, Hire American\" executive order, which called for federal agencies to take stronger action to enforce immigration laws to protect U.S. workers.\\nBut the signing in June not only put foreign workers\\' plans on hold, it also left thousands of American parents expecting the help of an au pair scrambling for child care. The ban came at a particularly difficult time as the demand for child care exploded when schools and day cares shut down because of the pandemic. \\nAhead of the moratorium\\'s expiration, advocate groups on both sides of the issue have exerted strong pressure on the White House.\\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce and National Association of Manufacturers sued the Trump administration, charging that the rules would \"devastate companies across various industries\" if allowed to stand. \\n\"Banning critical and skilled workers from entering the country was a mistake, and it disrupted manufacturers\\' fight against COVID-19 at exactly the wrong time,\" NAM\\'s general counsel, Linda Kelly, told NPR in a statement Wednesday. \"Manufacturers\\' legal case halted the ban and ensured we could continue leading our pandemic response and economic recovery. Any effort to extend this misguided and unlawful policy would only hamper recovery efforts and undermine innovation at this consequential moment in our nation\\'s history.\"\\nIn October, a judge blocked the Trump administration\\'s ban on many foreign worker visas, but the ruling only applied to the companies represented by the business groups involved in the case.\\nAdvocates who favor tighter immigration restrictions argue the public health and economic crisis created by the pandemic is still the same as it was six months ago. \\nDan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, wrote a letter this week urging Trump to extend the measures well into 2021, noting it would leave Biden with a tough policy and political decision. \\n\"If Joe Biden does end up entering the Oval Office and quickly rescinds this Proclamation, he will have to answer to the American people and tell them why he decided to increase immigration and restore unfettered access to guest workers in the midst of the greatest economic crisis in living memory,\" Stein wrote in the letter that has also been circulated around Capitol Hill. \\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

Projected dates are fluid,\" the bureau said in the announcement. The Associated Press first reported the bureau\\'s plans to announce a delay.\\nUnder federal law, the commerce secretary, who oversees the bureau, is required to report to the president the latest state population totals within nine months of Census Day, which was April 1.\\nSince the Dec. 31 deadline was put in place by Congress in 1976, the bureau has never failed in delivering the first set of census numbers by the end of a census year. Before the bureau was established, the federal government did miss similar reporting deadlines in the 1800s, and Congress extended them afterward.\\nThe final timing of the 2020 census results\\' release could undermine President Trump\\'s efforts to make an unprecedented change to who is counted in key census numbers before leaving office. This month, the Supreme Court ruled it was too early for courts to weigh in on whether Trump can exclude unauthorized immigrants from numbers that the Constitution says must include the \"whole number of persons in each state.\"\\nIf the first census results are not ready until after Trump\\'s term ends on Jan. 20, it would be President-elect Joe Biden, not Trump, who would get control of the numbers, which are ultimately handed off to Congress for certification.\\nBack in April, the Trump administration publicly acknowledged that because of COVID-19, there was a need for four-month extensions to the legal deadlines for census results, including the demographic data due to states by March 31, 2021 for the redrawing of voting districts.\\nBut the administration made an about-face and stopped asking Congress for those extensions in July, right around the time Trump issued a presidential memorandum calling for unauthorized immigrants to be left out of census apportionment counts.\\n Now, lawmakers will likely have to deal with the fallout of the missed census deadline after the new Congress is in session beginning Jan. 3. \\nSen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii who co-sponsored a bipartisan Senate bill in September to extend census deadlines, is planning to re-introduce the legislation in 2021, Schatz\\'s communication director, Mike Inacay, tells NPR.\\nWhile the delay was long expected in a tumultuous year and there is no penalty specified by federal law for not reporting the first set of numbers on time, the moment is remarkable for the Census Bureau, which had been planning and working towards Dec. 31 for close to a decade.\\n\"I can tell you that nowhere have I seen a greater adherence to statutorily mandated deadlines,\" says Edgar Chen, a former attorney in the Commerce Department\\'s Office of the General Counsel who has also worked at the Justice and Treasury Departments.Barry Robinson, a former chief counsel for economic affairs at the Commerce Department, recalls advising Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross during an internal meeting in 2017 about the legal obligation to adhere to the provided timelines for the census. But Robinson says, especially in light of the pandemic, the government cannot prioritize meeting deadlines over the importance of producing a complete and accurate count.\\n\"I\\'m the first to say that what I\\'m looking at now with the delays caused by the disruption of COVID-19, I think there is a very plausible and justifiable argument for a reasonable extension of time to allow the Census Bureau to fully complete its functions,\" Robinson says.\\nU.S. census historian Margo Anderson notes that until shortly before the 1930 census, the federal government did not have legal deadlines for reporting results to the president or Congress, although census workers were instructed to turn in paper reports by set dates.\\n\"This used to take months to get paper sent around the country so that a lot of times the deadlines would be missed simply because of more localized incidents of a natural disaster,\" says Anderson, author of The American Census: A Social History.\\nAnderson warns that the full implications of the bureau missing the first reporting deadline for the 2020 census may not be clear until later.\\n\"We won\\'t know whether the census is sort of up to snuff until the data start rolling out,\" Anderson says. \"And then we may look back, realizing what was going on was much more significant.

Since early December, she\\'s been tasked with caring for six critically ill patients per shift instead of four.\\nCalifornia\\'s telemetry nurses, who specialize in the electronic monitoring of critically ill patients, normally take care of four patients at once. But ever since the state relaxed California\\'s mandatory nurse-to-patient ratios in mid-December, Nerissa Black has had to keep track of six.\\nAnd these six patients are really sick: they all need constant electronic heart monitoring and many of them are being treated simultaneously for a stroke and COVID-19, or a heart attack and COVID-19. With more patients than usual needing more complex care, Black says she\\'s worried she\\'ll miss something or make a mistake.\\n\"We are given 50% more patients and we\\'re expected to do 50% more things with the same amount of time,\" says Black, who has worked at the Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital in Valencia, Calif., for the past seven years. \"I go home and I feel like I could have done more. I don\\'t feel like I\\'m giving the care to my patients like a human being deserves.\"\\nWe are given 50% more patients and we\\'re expected to do 50% more things with the same amount of time.\\nNerissa Black, telemetry nurse\\nAs COVID-19 patients continue to flood California emergency rooms, hospitals are increasingly desperate to find enough staff to care for all them. The state is asking nurses to take care of more patients simultaneously than they normally would, watering down what many nurses and their unions consider their most sacrosanct job protection: a law existing only in California that puts legal restrictions on the nurse-to-patient ratio.\\n\"We need to temporarily — very short-term, temporarily — look a little bit differently in terms of our staffing needs,\" said Gov. Gavin Newsom, after he quietly allowed hospitals to adjust their nurse-to-patient ratios on Dec. 11. Normally, California law requires a hospital to first get approval from the state before tinkering with those ratios; Newsom\\'s move gave hospitals presumptive approval to work outside the ratio rules immediately.\\nSince then, 170 hospitals, mainly in Southern California, have been operating under the new pandemic ratios: They can require ICU nurses to care for three patients instead of two. Emergency room and telemetry nurses may now be asked to care for six patients instead of four. Medical-surgical nurses are looking after seven patients instead of five.\\nThis is catastrophic and we cannot dodge this math. We are simply out of nurses, out of doctors, out of respiratory therapists.\\nCarmela Coyle, President and CEO, California Hospital Association\\nNurses have taken to the streets in protest, holding socially distanced demonstrations across the state, shouting and carrying posters that read: \"Ratios Save Lives.\" The union, the California Nurses Association, says the staffing shortage is a result of bad hospital management, of taking a reactive approach to staffing rather than proactive: laying nurses off over the summer, then not hiring or training enough for winter.\\n\"What we\\'re seeing in these hospitals is their just-in-time response to a pandemic that they never prepared for: just-in-time staffing, just-in-time resources, not staffing up, calling nurses in on a shift at the very last minute — to boost profits,\" says Stephanie Roberson, the government relations director for the California Nurses Association. \"And we\\'re seeing how nurses are being stretched even thinner.\"\\n\\n                Unionized nurses in California held a rally Aug. 5 as part of a National Day of Action to increase awareness, they say, of ways nurse staffing ratios in hospitals can have an impact on patient safety.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Nerissa Black\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nUnionized nurses in California held a rally Aug. 5 as part of a National Day of Action to increase awareness, they say, of ways nurse staffing ratios in hospitals can have an impact on patient safety.\\nBut hospitals say this is an unprecedented crisis that has spiraled beyond their control. In the current surge, four times as many Californians are testing positive for the coronavirus compared to the summer peak. As many as 7,000 new patients could soon be coming to California hospitals every day, according to Carmela Coyle, who heads the California Hospital Association.\\n\"This is catastrophic and we cannot dodge this math,\" she says. \"We are simply out of nurses, out of doctors, out of respiratory therapists.\"\\nThe state has asked the federal government for staff, including 200 medical personnel from the U.S. Department of Defense, and it\\'s tried to reactivate the California Health Corps, an initiative to recruit retired health workers to come back to work, but that has yielded few people with the qualifications needed to care for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\\nHiring contract nurses from temporary staffing agencies or other states is all but impossible right now, Coyle says.\\n\"Because California surged early during the summer and other parts of the United States then surged afterward,\" she says, \"those travel nurses are taken.\"\\nHospitals\\' next step is to try \"team nursing,\" Coyle says, pulling nurses from other departments, like the operating room, for example, and partnering them with experienced critical care nurses to help care for COVID-19 patients.\\nJoanne Spetz is an economics professor who studies health care workforce issues at the University of California, San Francisco. She says hospitals should have started training nurses for team care over the summer, in anticipation of a winter surge, but they didn\\'t, either because of costs — hospitals lost a lot of revenue from canceled elective surgeries that could have paid for that training — or because of excessive optimism.\\n\"California was doing so well,\" she says. \"It was easy for all of us to believe that we kind of got it under control, and I think there was a lot of belief that we would be able to maintain that.\"\\nThe California Nurses Association has good reason to be defensive when it comes to the integrity of the patient ratio law, Spetz says. It took 10 years of lobbying and activism before the bill passed the state legislature in 1999, then several more years to overcome multiple court challenges, including one from then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.\\n\"I\\'m always kicking their butt, that\\'s why they don\\'t like me,\" Schwarzenegger famously said of nurses, drawing broad ire from the nurse\\'s union and its allies.\\nNurses prevailed in the court of public opinion and in law; rules that put a legal cap on the number of patients per nurse finally took effect in 2004. But the long battle has made nurses fiercely protective of their win. They\\'ve even accused hospitals of using the pandemic to try to roll back ratios for good.\\n\"This is the exercise of disaster capitalism at its finest, where [hospital administrators] are completely maximizing their opportunity to take advantage of this crisis,\" says Roberson.\\nHospitals deny they want to change the ratio law permanently, and Spetz says it\\'s unlikely that they\\'d succeed if they tried.\\nThe public can see that nurses are overworked and burned out by the pandemic, she adds, so there would be little support for cutting back their job protections once it\\'s over.\\n\"To go in and say, \\'Oh, you clearly did so well without ratios when we let you waive them, so let\\'s just eliminate them entirely,\\' I think, would be just adding insult to moral injury,\" Spetz says.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

A random tweet can derail a blockbuster movie; a stream of clever TikTok videos can create a star. And all the biggest media companies are chasing viewer tastes more intensely than ever, focusing on their streaming platforms as consumers create an increasingly personalized, fractured media diet.\\nHere\\'s how all that adds up to the four biggest ways 2020 transformed media.\\n\\n                An AMC movie theater shuttered by the coronavirus in Harwood Heights, Ill.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nOnce the center of the entertainment universe, broadcast television and movie theaters have been hit hard by the pandemic, which has changed consumer behavior in lasting ways.\\nFor broadcasters, the lockdowns in mid-March forced many shows to end their seasons early and kept networks like ABC, CBS, NBC, The CW and Fox from developing many new shows. The fall season, when broadcasters often debut their most-anticipated new series, was pushed back for months.

Add in the possibility of COVID-19 exposure and increased availability of theatrical films on streaming, and that math tilts pretty hard against movie theaters.  \\nI\\'ve often believed the rise of new media doesn\\'t kill old media; it just forces it to change.

Indeed, it is notable that the top two contenders for factchecking website PolitiFact\\'s \"Lie of the Year\" in 2020 were often echoed by President Trump and Trump-friendly media outlets like Fox News Channel: COVID-19 denialism and a refusal to believe Joe Biden won the presidential election (Coronavirus denial eventually won the top spot).  \\nThe problem was highlighted in a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist survey, which found 61 percent of Americans overall trusted the presidential election result, but just 24 percent of Republicans did.\\nWe are learning this year how much of American democracy depends on the mutual acceptance of norms and basic facts. What we may learn next year, is what happens to democracy if that mutual acceptance drops even further.  \\n\\n                A protester holds up a portrait of George Floyd during a \"Black Lives Matter\" demonstration in front of the Brooklyn Library and Grand Army Plaza on June 5, 2020, in Brooklyn, N.Y.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nThis year, I saw three things happen in television that I never expected.

And CBS, a network long criticized for its lack of diversity, announced specific diversity goals for scripted and unscripted series, aimed at boosting the numbers of non-white people throughout their productions.\\nMany factors led to these changes, including the reckoning over systemic racism kicked off by the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police this summer. And CBS has weathered a string of scandals this year involving allegations of abusive workplace conduct or staffers and contestants of color feeling marginalized at shows like All Rise, Hawaii Five-O, Magnum P.I., MacGuyver and Survivor.\\nSkeptical as I am about the TV industry\\'s resistance to real transformation on racial issues — note reports that Cops quietly resumed production after its cancelation by Paramount Network to make episodes for overseas outlets — the success of shows led by non-white characters like I May Destroy You, Lovecraft Country, Small Axe, P-Valley, Ramy and The Last Dance are a good sign.\\nThe world of journalism also saw seismic changes this year, from the resignation of The Philadelphia Inquirer\\'s editor after the newspaper published a headline which offensively referenced the Black Lives Matter movement – it read, \"Buildings Matter, Too\" – to apologies from both The Los Angeles Times and The Kansas City Star for past racism in its coverage on people of color.\\nIt all feels like a long-overdue recognition of the impact systemic racism continues to have on media. The issue goes beyond individual acts perpetrated by specific people; it\\'s about ending habits, strategies, reflexes and traditions within platforms which marginalize non-white people.  \\nThere\\'s more work to be done, especially to feature Hispanic characters and storytellers, who remain among the most underrepresented groups on TV and in journalism.\\nBut at a time when some of the best shows on television are also the most diverse, there\\'s little argument left for failing to reflect the wide array of races, cultures, genders and orientations visible in the wider world. \\n\\n                Quibi, the mobile-first streaming service to specialize in original shows with short five to 10-minute-long episodes, shut down its business operations in October, little more than six months after it launched.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Chris Delmas/AFP via Getty Images\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nThe streaming wars kicked off with big platform launches, from Apple TV+ and Disney+ late last year, to WarnerMedia\\'s HBO Max and NBC Universal\\'s Peacock this year. 2020 showed us the shape of the coming second phase: increasing and refining what\\'s on these platforms, to define the identity of the service and hold your attention.\\nIt\\'s like that scene in every Marvel movie where all the heroes assemble for the big fight: Disney this month announced plans to fill Disney+ with lots of new material – 100 titles annually for the next four years – including at least 10 new Star Wars shows and 11 Marvel programs. Warner Bros. will debut all 17 of its feature films scheduled for release in 2021 on HBO Max the same date they hit theaters. They\\'re both gunning for each other and industry leader Netflix, which still has more subscribers than either Disney+ or HBO Max.\\nAnd even though short-form streamer Quibi died just months after launch, new streaming platforms like AMC+ and Discovery+ have emerged, filled with even more content.\\nThis will be a pitched battle for control of the attention economy – what earns consumers\\' notice and loyalty. In the process, more material will move to streaming television, reaching us through our smartphones, tablets, desktops or smart TVs.\\nThe success of Disney+\\'s launch – Disney says it gained nearly 87 million subscribers since its launch in November 2019, four years sooner than early predictions – resulted from careful planning and help from the pandemic. The service had a library of classic content filled with material from Disney, Marvel, Lucasfilm (Star Wars), Pixar and National Geographic. Disney+ only needed one original hit early on, the amazing reinvention of the Star Wars universe called The Mandalorian. \\nHBO Max had a tougher ride, with a monthly subscription fee of nearly $15 (about twice the cost of Disney+) and a less impressive content library when stacked against Disney+\\'s big franchises. Moving films like The Matrix 4 and the Suicide Squad sequel to HBO Max may help juice consumer interest, but it will come at the expense of angering the film industry and theater owners, who may lose a fortune if Warner Bros. films struggle at the box office.\\nSuccessfully taking advantage of a media trend is all about timing: Sure, everything may likely move to streaming eventually, but did Warner Bros. pull the trigger too soon?\\nThe answer to that question will determine the shape of the world\\'s most powerful entertainment companies for years to come.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

Many major customers, such as food service companies that supply restaurants, weren\\'t buying pork. Prices had fallen sharply. Some hog farmers had no place to ship their animals because so many workers in pork processing plants got sick from COVID-19.\\n\"Our folks need a lifeline,\" said Nick Giordano, top lobbyist for the National Pork Producers Council, on a call with journalists in May. \"Unless there is a large cash infusion from the federal government, we\\'re going to lose a lot of producers.\"\\nOther farmers also demanded government aid. They got their wish.\\nCongress approved about $35 billion in emergency aid to farmers, which came on top of roughly $10 billion in traditional farm subsidies that were already in place. In addition, farmers were able to tap billions of dollars in funding from the Paycheck Protection Program.\\nThe aid, delivered in two separate packages over the course of the year, went to a wide variety of people in agriculture, including corn and soybean farmers, cattle ranchers, and fruit and vegetable producers. The $46 billion in direct government payments to farmers in 2020 broke the previous annual record by about $10 billion, even after accounting for inflation.\\n\"You almost lose track of how much money is going out,\" says Joseph Glauber, formerly the U.S. Department of Agriculture\\'s chief economist, now a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute.\\nYet as the flood of money continued through the summer and fall, most farmers\\' economic worries were receding. \"Commodity prices have come back up and actually are looking better than they\\'ve looked in several years,\" Glauber says.\\nTotal U.S. farm income in 2020 would have been about average, compared with the past 20 years, even without the emergency aid. The massive government payments turned it into the fifth-most profitable year since 1975.\\nFarmers didn\\'t have to prove that they needed help in order to qualify for subsidies. They simply got paid based on their previous production of grain or pigs or cattle. The more crops they grew, the more government money they got, up to a cap of $250,000 per person. Up to three partners in any enterprise could collect that maximum amount.\\nFinal figures aren\\'t yet available, but based on previous years, it\\'s likely that most of the money went to fewer than 100,000 farms. \"I think there is a fundamental question: Why are we providing all this additional aid?\" Glauber says.\\nFarmers contacted by NPR had a variety of answers to that question. Chad Leman, co-owner of a large hog farm in central Illinois, says the federal aid kept some pork producers from going under. \"You would have seen significant fallout had there not been some assistance,\" he says.\\nLeman\\'s farm received more than $700,000 in government payments in 2020, according to USDA data obtained by the Environmental Working Group, a long-time critic of many farm subsidies.\\nLeman\\'s government aid was limited by the cap on payments to any single enterprise, and Leman says his farm still will lose money this year. \"None of us expect to be made whole\" from pandemic-related losses,\" says Leman. \"Our ask was, \\'Help us get to the next year.\\' So I\\'m grateful for what has been done.\"\\nThe EWG regularly publishes the names of wealthy and well-connected people who\\'ve received farm subsidies. They include members of Congress who vote on such payments. Sen. Kelly Loeffler of Georgia, for instance, who is currently campaigning to keep her seat in the Senate, owns a share in a family farming enterprise that, according to EWG figures, received more than a million dollars in federal subsidies over the past two years.\\nOther farmers, who declined to be named, said they were glad to get the money and embarrassed at having to rely on government payouts.\\nRon Rosmann, an organic farmer in western Iowa, says his neighbors rarely talked about the payments, but sometimes made jokes about them. He recalls overhearing one group of older farmers as they played cards. \"I heard one guy say, \\'Yep, got another check from the government today. Didn\\'t need it, but boy! I don\\'t know what to do with it!\\'\"\\nRosmann got some of this money himself, yet he says he\\'s not in favor of the program. \"It has disproportionately gone to the largest producers,\" he says. The move continues to fuel the trend of large farms growing bigger, outbidding smaller farmers when land comes up for rent or for sale.\\nThat, in turn, means fewer people in rural communities, and less life in small towns. It seems paradoxical, but according to Rosmann, passing out money to farmers this way can actually hurt farming communities. \"We just continue to fight a declining and aging population out here,\" Rosmann says.\\nYet more money may be on the way. The latest coronavirus relief package, just approved by Congress, contains another $8 billion in payments to farmers.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

As protesters took to the streets in cities across the U.S. in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis, Minn., so did demonstrators in other countries — all with a similar message: Black lives matter.\\n\"There is a George Floyd in every country,\" South Africa-based journalist Lynsey Chutel tells NPR\\'s David Greene during a recent roundtable interview.\\nJoining Chutel for Morning Edition\\'s roundtable are Ana Luisa González, a freelance journalist based in Colombia and Febriana Firdaus, a freelance investigative journalist based in Indonesia. [To hear the conversation, press the audio button above.]\\nDemonstrations spread across Colombia in June. They were sparked by the May killing of a young Black man named Anderson Arboleda in Puerto Tejada, who was allegedly beaten to death by police for breaking pandemic rules. Activists called for justice for Arboleda and other young Afro-Latino men killed by police.\\n\"This message of this movement — Las Vidas Negras Importan — of Black Lives Matter, were young Afro-Colombians who wanted to speak out against police brutality and structural racism,\" Gonzales says. Like much of Latin America, Spanish colonialism informs many societal divisions in Colombia today, she says.\\nYet, most Colombians don\\'t seem to want to talk about racism and colorism, she says. In the most recent census, a majority of Colombians identified as \"no race\" and \"until we acknowledge this debate, we can\\'t change things,\" Gonzales says.\\nIn South Africa, demonstrators came together following the police killing of 16-year-old Nathaniel Julies, a boy of mixed heritage with Down syndrome. Julies was shot and killed in August by police near his home in a neighborhood of Soweto allegedly for being outside his home during a pandemic lockdown. Chutel says that in the days after young people marched to the police station out of a sense of \"deep frustration with this police station and the police force in general who are able to behave with impunity.\"\\n\\n                Alliance of Papuan Students are seen protesting in Surabaya, Indonesia, on June 16, 2020.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Candra Wijaya/Barcroft Media via Getty Images\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nAlliance of Papuan Students are seen protesting in Surabaya, Indonesia, on June 16, 2020.\\n\"If you have a police system that was used as the foot soldiers of the apartheid regime, where even though now the police are Black and the communities are Black the culture of policing it still very much that authoritarian, militarized policing system,\" says Chutel. She says that while protesters directly borrowed some language from the U.S.-based Black Lives Matter Movement, they also made their message uniquely South African by incorporating the phrase \"Colored Lives Matter.\" The word colored, she explains, is an old apartheid segregationist term used to describe someone of mixed heritage in South Africa.\\nActivists in Indonesia inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement also made the message their own. The phrase #AllPapuanLivesMatter went viral, calling attention to the decades-long secessionist movement in West Papua, which has created tensions between the minority Papuans and ethnic Javanese-majority in the country.\\n\"It\\'s hard for West Papuans to find a rent house [sic] because they always get rejected,\" Firdaus says. \"The landlord literally says it\\'s because they are Black and they are Christian. We are majority Muslim.\"\\nFirdaus says ever since Jakarta took control of West Papua from the Dutch in the 1960s as part of the New York Agreement, Indonesia has never allowed Papuans to integrate fully into society. But the #PapuaLivesMatter message might be a turning point \"because many young Indonesians right now feel they are emotionally involved with this issue,\" Firdaus says.\\nTo hear the conversation, press the audio button above. \\nAshley Westerman edited and Ryan Benk produced the broadcast version of this story.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

The executions, including ones scheduled to take place just days before Biden\\'s inauguration, have prompted criticism of the Trump administration\\'s actions.\\n\"There have never been so many executions scheduled for so late in a presidency during any transition period in the entire history of the United States,\" said Robert Dunham, the head of the nonpartisan Death Penalty Information Center.\\nDunham said that the U.S. government has not had multiple federal executions during a presidential transition since the late 1800s, and that the Trump administration\\'s actions are without historical precedent.\\nFormer Attorney General William Barr, who last week left the Justice Department, has said the government is carrying out justice for \"staggeringly brutal murders.\"\\nTrump critics have denounced the decision to resume executions during an election year as politically motivated, and are focused on what Biden can do when he takes office.\\n\"He says he opposes the death penalty, so we want him to use his clemency power and end this cruelty once and for all,\" said Rep.-elect Cori Bush of Missouri, a Democrat who will take office next week.\\nBush has publicly called on Biden to grant clemency to every person on federal death row. In an interview, she said that a moratorium on federal executions would not go far enough because it would simply stave off the issue until the next administration, leaving lives hanging in the balance.\\nFormer President Barack Obama did not use his clemency powers widely to commute federal death sentences to life terms. If he had, death penalty opponents say, the people currently facing execution would no longer be on death row.\\n\"After four years or eight years or however long President Joe Biden is in his seat, we don\\'t want the next person to come in and to be able to do what the Trump administration is currently doing,\" Bush said.\\nBush is one of a group of lawmakers, led by Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley, who wrote to Biden calling on him act.\\nThe death penalty is unjust, racist, and has no place in any society.President-elect @JoeBiden has the power to halt all federal executions and call for the re-sentencing of those on death row on Day 1. He must use that authority. https://t.co/hJG2e9jzM8\\nIn a letter dated Dec. 15, the lawmakers describe capital punishment as \"unjust, racist, and defective,\" and write that the Trump administration \"weaponized capital punishment with callous disregard for human life.\"\\n\"Ending the barbaric and inhumane practice of government-sanctioned murder is a commonsense step that you can and must take to save lives,\" the lawmakers write. \"We respectfully urge you to sign an executive order on Day 1 to place an immediate moratorium on the country\\'s cruel use of the death penalty and signal your commitment to dismantle its use altogether.\"\\nThe lawmakers are calling on Biden to \"end the federal death penalty\" on his first day in office. That\\'s something that he wouldn\\'t be able to do alone.\\n\"A U.S. president does not have the power to abolish the federal death penalty,\" Dunham said. \"The only way that the federal death penalty can be abolished is an act of Congress signed by a president, or from a court decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. It\\'s clear from the current composition of the Supreme Court that that\\'s not going to happen, so the only way that the Biden administration would be able to end the federal death penalty would be to have some sort of bipartisan support in Congress.\"\\nThe Biden transition team didn\\'t respond directly to questions about the lawmakers\\' letter, or whether he would consider commuting the sentences of every person on federal death row. But during the campaign, candidate Biden pledged to eliminate the death penalty, citing some 160 people who were sentenced to capital punishment since the 1970s and were later exonerated. He\\'s also said he would incentivize states to follow the federal government\\'s example.\\nPressley has sponsored legislation to abolish the death penalty, which Bush says she will support as soon as she takes office. Bush says she sympathizes with family members seeking justice, but that she doesn\\'t \"believe that the way to solve it is to hurt another body.\"\\nWhile the death penalty was not a significant issue raised during the 2020 presidential race, there are sharp differences in the views of Biden and Trump. Biden opposes the death penalty, while Trump is a supporter of capital punishment who painted himself as a law-and-order president during the campaign.\\nThe renewed debate over the death penalty is now playing out as support for the practice is at its lowest point over the past five decades, according to Gallup polling. While there have been declines in support for the death penalty among Democrats and independents, according to Gallup\\'s historical data, support among Republicans has remained relatively steady.\\nIt may be difficult to find bipartisan support in Congress for a repeal of the practice. Unless Democrats win two runoff elections in Georgia, Republicans will hold control of the Senate. And Democrats will have a slim majority in the House.\\nRegardless, Bush says she\\'s hopeful that there is enough support on Capitol Hill to pass the legislation, but that Biden will need to use the bully pulpit to convince the public that the issue is urgent. She\\'s ready to help.\\n\"My hand is raised. The hands of my team are raised. We will help do the work,\" she said. \"If he will call on me. If he will call on Rep.

With mild weather forecast and Colorado\\'s breathtaking fall foliage as a backdrop, she was excited — convinced an excursion at Beaver Ranch Park would be the quintessential way to close out months of warm-weather hikes with her \"sister friends.\"\\nStill, when that Sunday morning arrived in 2018, Newton was shocked when her usual crew of about 15 had mushroomed to include about 70 Black women. There\\'s a first time for everything, she thought, as they broke into smaller groups and headed toward the nature trail. What a sight they were, she recalls, as the women — in sneakers and hiking boots, a virtual sea of colorful head wraps, flowy braids and dreadlocks, poufy twists and long, flowy locks — trekked peacefully across the craggy terrain in the crisp mountain air.\\nIt. Was. Perfect. Exactly what Newton had envisioned when in 2017 she founded Black Girls Hike to connect with other Black women who share her affinity for outdoor activities. She also wanted to recruit others who had yet to experience the serenity of spending time with friends in nature, which she fell for as a child attending an affluent, predominately white private school.\\n\\n                Jessica Newton, who formed Vibe Tribe Adventures to encourage other Black women to enjoy the outdoors, listens during a first aid class at Bear Creek Regional Park.

She said that we\\'d spooked her horse,\" she says of a woman in a group of white horseback riders they encountered. \"It just didn\\'t make any sense. I felt like, it\\'s a horse and you have an entire mountain that you can trot through, run through, gallop through or whatever. She was just upset that we were in her space.\"\\nEventually, two Jefferson County sheriff\\'s deputies, with guns on their hips, approached, asking, \"What\\'s going on here?\" They had been contacted by rangers who\\'d received complaints about a large group of Black women being followed by camera drones in the park; the drones belonged to a national television news crew shooting a feature on the group.

The news crew told deputies that the group members felt insulted by the horseback riders use of the term \"mob.\" The woman leading the horseback riders, identified in the incident report as Marie Elliott, said that she did not remember calling the group a mob, but she told the officers she \"would have said the same thing if the group had been a large group of Girl Scouts.\"\\nIn the end, Newton and her fellow hikers were warned for failing to secure a permit for their group. Newton says she regrets putting members in a distressing — and potentially life-threatening — situation by unknowingly breaking a park rule. However, she suspects that a similarly sized hiking group of white women would not have been confronted so aggressively.\\n\"You should be excited that we are bringing more people to use your parks,\" added Newton. \"Instead, we got slammed with [threats of] violations and \\'Who are you?\\' and \\'Please, get your people and get out of here.\\' It\\'s just crazy.\"\\nMike Taplin, spokesperson for the Jefferson County Sheriff\\'s Office, confirms that no citations were issued. The deputies \"positively engaged with everyone, with the goal of preserving the peace,\" he says.\\nNewton says the \"frustrating\" incident has reminded her why her group, which she revamped and renamed Vibe Tribe Adventures last year, is so needed in the white-dominated outdoor enthusiasts\\' arena.\\n\\n                Jan Garduno says becoming a member of Vibe Tribe has offered the camaraderie and safety that comes with hiking in a group.

Today, the Denver-based group has 11 chapters across the U.S. (even Guam) and Canada, with about 2,100 members.\\nResearch suggests her work is needed. The most recent National Park Service survey found that 6% of visitors are Black, compared with 77% white. Newton says that must change — especially given the opportunities parks provide and the health challenges that disproportionately plague Black women. Research shows they experience higher rates of chronic preventable health conditions, including diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. A 2020 study of more than 17,000 women found that racial discrimination also may increase stress, lead to health problems and reduce cognitive functioning in Black women. Newton says those findings underscore the need for stress-relieving activities, and the power of nature to deliver.\\n\"It\\'s been studied at several colleges that if you are outdoors for at least five minutes, it literally brings your stress level down significantly,\" says Newton. \"Being around nature, it\\'s like grounding yourself.

She founded the Colorado nonprofit Blackpackers in 2019.\\n\"One thing I caught people saying a lot of is \\'Well, nature is free\\' and \\'Nature isn\\'t racist\\' — and there\\'s two things wrong with that,\" says Cameron, a 37-year-old mother of a preteen.\\n\"Nature and outside can be free, yes, but what about transportation?

And Biden wasn\\'t alone among the Democratic presidential contenders. The call for closer ties between domestic policies and what\\'s happening around the world has become an increasingly central theme of the party\\'s foreign policy debates. \\nSullivan has played a leading role in this reorientation. He was a top staffer to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the Obama administration before later serving as then-Vice President Biden\\'s national security adviser. Sullivan was a senior policy adviser to Clinton\\'s 2016 campaign and therefore had a front-row seat to her surprise loss to a candidate who ran on a nationalist and isolationist platform.\\nSince then, Sullivan has repeatedly written and spoken about the need to put America\\'s middle class at the center of foreign policy debates and decision-making. \\nSo, with just three weeks to go before Biden is sworn into office and Sullivan begins occupying a key role in shaping U.S. engagement abroad, I (virtually) sat down with him to discuss the reasons behind that focus, and what it might look like as the Biden administration begins implementing its policies.\\nMeasuring impact on \"ordinary Americans\"\\nSullivan has been frank about the fact that, as he says, the Obama administration didn\\'t do enough to tie foreign initiatives to domestic concerns — particularly when it came to economic policies. \\nI asked Sullivan whether that lack of focus on the American middle class opened the door to Trump\\'s nationalism.\\n\"What produced Donald Trump was a broad amalgam of factors, and so I wouldn\\'t point to any one thing,\" he said. \"But I would say this — I believe that the fact that we did not elevate and center middle-class concerns in our foreign policy and national security meant that we were not delivering for the American people as well as we should have, that we can learn from that, and then we can do better as we go forward.\"\\nLooking forward, he sees the focus — along with a return to more engagement with global allies — as \"a more decisive and sustained rebuttal to Trumpism, by showing that engagement in the world ... can deliver the kinds of tangible results — by protecting people from pandemics, reducing the worst effects of climate change, increasing the protection against the kinds of abuses we see from China and other economic actors. We can do these things.\"\\n\"What Joe Biden is proposing, and what I am reinforcing as the national security adviser, is that every element of what we do in our foreign policy and national security ultimately has to be measured by the impact it has on working families, middle-class people, ordinary Americans here in the United States,\" Sullivan said. \\nSeeking leverage over China \"the right way\"\\nHow will this affect policymaking? Sullivan pointed to China, and the way the Trump administration approached a trade war that escalated to aggressive tariffs.\\n\"What were their negotiating priorities? What did they push for?\" he asked, referring to the Trump administration. \"Well, one of the things they pushed for was access for major U.S. financial institutions to do business in China. And the question I would pose is, what does that have to do with jobs and wages here in the United States, making it easier for the likes of JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs to, to be able to carry out financial activities in Beijing or Shanghai?\"\\nBiden recently told The New York Times that he won\\'t immediately revoke Trump\\'s tariffs on China. I asked Sullivan whether that amounts to a concession that Trump\\'s policies gave the U.S. leverage. Here\\'s his response:\\n\"Well, the president-elect has said from the beginning of this campaign that in order to get China to change its abuses, we do need to build up leverage. We just have to do it the right way, by investing in our sources of strength. So [Biden\\'s] objection to Donald Trump was not trying to seek leverage against China. It was doing it in a way that actually hasn\\'t produced results.\\n\"And one of the major examples of that is that the United States has gone it alone in its trade fight with China, rather than rallying other like-minded democracies, other market economies that collectively comprise 50[%] to 60% of the world\\'s economy, where if we got all of them lined up and went to China with a common agenda to say, \\'We won\\'t accept these subsidies, this intellectual property theft, this dumping,\\' we would be in a position to get China to either change its behavior, or we could collectively impose costs on China for not doing so.\"\\nSullivan and other incoming Biden administration officials have repeatedly signaled they will pressure China on trade, human rights, intellectual property theft and other areas of disagreement — even as they seek to work alongside the fellow global power to confront climate change. \\nThese areas, Sullivan said, are prime examples of how he and other Biden officials will view decisions through that middle-class framework. \\n\"The United States is going to ensure, for example, that we have the kind of free and open Internet where people can engage in commerce and speak freely and not have to worry about surveillance by foreign authoritarians, or not have to worry that the businesses that they either work for, or purchase from, are having to change their practices in fundamental ways to conform to the authoritarian tendencies of other governments. Those are things that affect Americans,\" he said.\\n\"You know, there was an example from [2019] of where China tried to basically censor the National Basketball Association, the NBA,\" he said. \\nChinese authorities cracked down on the distribution of Houston Rockets games within the country\\'s borders after the team\\'s general manager expressed support for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. \\n\"Now, that\\'s not on the same scale and scope as COVID-19, not even in the same sport, let alone the same ballpark,\" Sullivan said. \"But it\\'s the kind of example of where, if we do not speak out on behalf of our values and our way of life, it gets chipped away at in ways that end up encumbering and having an impact on American families and American communities.\"\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

Scientists say the virus was transmitted to humans from another species.\\nAnd one-third of Americans believe that voter fraud helped Joe Biden win the 2020 election, despite the fact that courts, election officials and the Justice Department have found no evidence of widespread fraud that could have changed the outcome.\\nThe poll results add to mounting evidence that misinformation is gaining a foothold in American society and that conspiracy theories are going mainstream, especially during the coronavirus pandemic. This has raised concerns about how to get people to believe in a \"baseline reality,\" said Chris Jackson, a pollster with Ipsos.\\n\"Increasingly, people are willing to say and believe stuff that fits in with their view of how the world should be, even if it doesn\\'t have any basis in reality or fact,\" Jackson said.\\n\"What this poll really illustrates to me is how willing people are to believe things that are ludicrous because it fits in with a worldview that they want to believe.\"\\n Loading... \\n\"That\\'s terrifying\" \\nThe NPR/Ipsos poll of 1,115 U.S. adults was conducted Dec. 21 to 22. The credibility interval for the overall sample is 3.3 percentage points.\\nOne of the most striking poll findings has to do with QAnon, the baseless conspiracy theory that gained widespread attention this year as two of its backers were elected to Congress.\\nThe poll asked respondents whether they believe that \"a group of Satan-worshipping elites who run a child sex ring are trying to control our politics and media\" — the false allegation at the heart of QAnon. While only 17% said it was true, another 37% said they didn\\'t know.\\n\"It\\'s total bonkers,\" said Jackson, \"and yet ... essentially half of Americans believe it\\'s true or think that maybe it\\'s true. They don\\'t really know. And I think that\\'s terrifying that half of Americans believe that could be the case.\"\\nAccording to the poll, 39% of Americans believe another key tenet of the QAnon theory: that there is a deep state working to undermine President Trump.\\nThe president is himself a major source of misinformation, as he continues to make baseless claims about election fraud on Twitter and elsewhere. Conservative media also have devoted hours of coverage to exaggerated or debunked claims.\\nThe NPR/Ipsos poll suggests those claims are having an impact. Two-thirds of Republicans surveyed said they believe that voter fraud helped Biden win the election, and fewer than half of Republicans said they accept the outcome of the election.\\n\"There\\'s just too much information out there,\" said Brooke Williams, a Republican voter and self-described QAnon follower from Oro Valley, Ariz., during a follow-up interview with NPR. \"I can\\'t see how anybody is not thoroughly convinced that Biden was illegally elected.\"\\nIn contrast, only 11% of Democrats think voter fraud helped Biden win the election, and 93% accept the outcome.\\n Loading... \\nWhom Americans trust\\nOverall, most respondents said they do want to see a peaceful transition to a Biden administration in January, though many are worried about political violence over the next four years.\\nThe vast majority of Americans said they\\'re also worried about the spread of false information, with 4 out of 5 poll respondents saying they\\'re concerned about misinformation related to the coronavirus and vaccines in particular.\\nBut Republicans were more likely than Democrats to believe misinformation about the virus, including that it was created in a lab in China and that COVID-19 is no more of a \"serious threat\" than the seasonal flu.\\n\"I think it was deliberately released by China,\" said Jon Costello, a Republican from Huntsville, Ala., who responded to the poll. \"I think this big thing of shutting down businesses, shutting down education systems ... is all part of a plan to break the spirit and the will of Americans.\"\\nPoll respondents of both parties expressed skepticism about the vaccines that are now being distributed in the U.S., though Republicans were less likely than Democrats to say that they would \"take the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it is made available to me.\"\\n\"I shouldn\\'t have to take a vaccine for something that was man-made,\" said Shaena Castro, a Democrat who lives in New York City. \"I guess you can call me a conspiracy theorist or whatever, but yeah, I am convinced that it\\'s man-made.\"\\nWhen asked whom they trust, respondents mostly pointed to the people they encounter in their daily lives. Personal physicians scored highly, as did faith or spiritual leaders.\\nPoliticians and media figures did not fare as well. Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Rachel Maddow of MSNBC and Wolf Blitzer of CNN were at the bottom of the list.\\nMore Americans trust Biden than Trump, but both lagged behind Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who scored the highest of any specific person the poll asked about.\\n Loading... \\nNew misinformation vs. old conspiracy\\nPollsters say that multiple factors make people more or less susceptible to misinformation — including educational attainment, media consumption and political affiliation — and that people are more likely to believe conspiracy theories that fit into their worldview.\\nFor example, almost half of respondents said that the majority of racial justice protests over the summer were violent, when in fact the vast majority were peaceful. Poll respondents from all demographics answered this question incorrectly — but they were even more likely to do so if they were Republicans and if they got their news from Fox News or conservative online outlets like Breitbart or the Daily Caller.\\nRecent misinformation held more sway than some older conspiracy theories.\\nAbout 60% of Americans correctly answered that former President Barack Obama was born in the United States and that several mass shootings in recent years were not staged hoaxes. And about 70% correctly answered that humans do play a significant role in climate change — roughly the same percentage who believe astronauts landed on the moon in the 1960s and \\'70s.\\nIt\\'s also clear from the poll results that Americans are worried about misinformation, even if there\\'s no clear prescription for what to do about it.\\nNearly 70% of respondents said they are concerned that information they receive on social media is inaccurate; a similar percentage is concerned about foreign interference in U.S. social media.\\n\"I\\'m concerned to see so many people living in a false reality, seeing relatives honestly believe that this was some kind of rigged election,\" said William Street, who lives in northeast Mississippi.\\n\"It terrifies me that people can be that misled and believe conspiracy theories like that,\" Street tells NPR. \"I\\'m concerned that with even just a little prodding from this man in office, they could be led to do very desperate things.\"\\nNPR senior producer Marisa Peñaloza contributed to this story.\\n\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

They saw an RV in the yard and \"several security cameras with wires attached to an alarm sign on the front door.\"\\nThe police department\\'s bomb squad also called Throckmorton, who also identified himself as Warner\\'s attorney, a police spokesperson said. \"The recollection of that call is that Warner did not care for the police, and that Throckmorton would not allow his client to permit a visual inspection of the RV.\"\\nPolice did not take additional action.\\nBut Throckmorton recalls the follow-up conversation with police differently.

The move by the two chambers overrides Gov. Charlie Baker\\'s veto of the measure last week. \\nThe ROE Act, as it\\'s called, will allow abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy in cases with a fatal fetal anomaly and in instances when a physician deems it necessary \"to preserve the patient\\'s physical or mental health.\" \\nIt also lowers the age at which individuals can seek an abortion without the consent of a parent or a judge from 18 to 16. \\nSen. Harriette Chandler, who was behind one of the bills,  said she was proud of the legislature\\'s actions to secure \"reproductive freedoms\" for residents. \\n\"Pregnant people who once faced near-insurmountable barriers accessing abortion care can now seize the right to control their own bodies,\" Chandler said in a tweet Tuesday. \\nPregnant people who once faced near-insurmountable barriers accessing abortion care can now seize the right to control their own bodies.I am so proud of the policies included in  the #ROEAct and of the @MA_Senate for our commitment to reproductive freedom. #mapoli pic.twitter.com/pRBKmbAQLB\\nThe ROE Act Coalition, which coordinated a statewide effort to pass the new law, celebrated the Senate vote, calling it a victory and a major milestone. \\n\"With the ROE Act provisions now law, most young adults seeking abortion will be able to access the care and support they need without navigating the court system, and pregnant people facing a fatal fetal diagnosis later in pregnancy will be able to access abortion care here in Massachusetts, with a provider they know and trust, rather than traveling across the country for care,\" organizers said in a statement. \\nGov. Baker vetoed the bill on Christmas Eve after the legislature rejected his revisions. In a letter to lawmakers, the Republican governor said he \"strongly\"  supports the right to access reproductive health care, including the provision in the bill that would make abortions available after 24 weeks of pregnancy if the fetus would not survive after birth, State House News Service reported. \\nHe also agreed that a 24-hour waiting period before an abortion is unnecessary. However, he objected to revisions to the law that removed legal barriers for minors seeking to terminate a pregnancy. \\n\"I cannot support the sections of this proposal that expand the availability of later term abortions and permit minors age 16 and 17 to get an abortion without the consent of a parent or guardian,\" Baker wrote.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

The department has closed its investigation.\\nThe Justice Department announced it found insufficient evidence to \"support federal criminal charges against Cleveland Division of Police (CDP) Officers Timothy Loehmann and Frank Garmback.\"\\nIn a statement released Tuesday, the department said it notified Rice\\'s family attorneys about the decision on Monday \"and today sent a letter to Mr. Rice\\'s family explaining the findings of the investigation and reasons for the decision.\"\\nVideo footage of the killing, which happened in daylight on Nov. 22, 2014, shows the child was shot within two seconds of the police arriving at the scene. Loehmann, who fired two bullets into Rice, and Garmback allege they believed he was carrying a gun. In fact, the boy was playing with a toy air pellet gun near a playground at a city recreation center. \\nThe officers were responding to a 911 call during which the caller said there was a man — \"probably a juvenile\" — pointing a gun — \"probably fake\" — at people on the playground. However, the dispatcher failed to relay to the responding officers the fact that the subject of the call was likely a child with a toy. \\nRice died early the next morning at a Cleveland hospital. \\nOutrage over the boy\\'s death, which followed that of Eric Garner at the hands of New York City police in July 2014 and Michael Brown\\'s death in Ferguson, Mo., that August, was a leading narrative in the nascent Black Lives Matter movement that has emerged as a national call for police reform. \\nThere were no prosecutions in the case. In December 2015, a grand jury  declined to bring criminal charges against Loehmann and Garmback. \\nIn its statement Tuesday, the Justice Department said the officers \"repeatedly and consistently stated that Officer Loehmann gave Tamir multiple commands to show his hands before shooting, and both officers repeatedly and consistently said that they saw Tamir reaching for his gun.\"\\n\"Based on this evidence and the high burdens of the applicable federal laws, career prosecutors have concluded that there is insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Tamir did not reach for his toy gun; thus, there is insufficient evidence to establish that Officer Loehmann acted unreasonably under the circumstances,\" the department said. \\nThe statement noted Loehmann and Garmback were the only two witnesses in the near vicinity of the shooting. \\nLoehmann was fired nearly three years after Rice\\'s death for lying on his application to the Cleveland police. \\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

Indeed, in 2012 Rosiello received a liver transplant in Cleveland.\\nOrgan transplants are not as simple as someone dies somewhere, and then someone else — like John Caso of Johnson City, Tenn. — gets a new heart. As Caso learned, surprising twists and turns in the system can throw you for a loop.\\n\"You never expect to get the call that says, \\'We have an organ, but ...\\'\" Caso says.\\nIt was 2004 when he got that call, not long after he\\'d been added to the waiting list for a new heart. The hitch in this case: The donor heart they were calling about was coming from a person who had traded sex for drugs. Doctors couldn\\'t guarantee that there wouldn\\'t be infections.\\n\"I followed the advice of the surgeon and turned it down,\" Caso says. He would go on to turn down several more donor hearts before accepting one in 2016.\\nCaso could afford to be a little more choosy than some U.S. patients, because he lives in the Appalachian mountains of Northeast Tennessee, where the region\\'s poor health outcomes — like higher rates of strokes, fatal car crashes and gunshot deaths — actually benefit organ recipients. That\\'s because those causes of death are more likely to yield healthy organs that can be donated to others.\\nIn other parts of the U.S., particularly along the coasts, the causes of death are less likely to lead to transplantable hearts, lungs and other organs.\\nThis sort of variation across the country has resulted in inequities in the ease of receiving an organ from someone who has died nearby — and, as a result, led to recent changes in the rules governing how organs are distributed nationally. In turn, transplant centers in the South and Midwest have gone to court to fight those changes.\\nThe revised policy, recently finalized by the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, including changes that are set to take effect in 2022, is meant to boost the overall number of transplants performed in the U.S., so fewer people die waiting. (Currently around 20 people per day die on waiting lists.) But the rule change also highlights other chronic geographic disparities.\\nSome organ procurement organizations — called OPOs — point to the geographic differences in causes of death as the main reason they collect fewer organs compared to OPOs in other regions.\\nBut is that the full reason behind the disparities? No one can say for sure, because data-gathering has never been standardized across the United States — OPOs have always self-reported their data. Under the new rules, that will end.\\nInstead, all 58 OPOs in the U.S. will be assessed under the same accounting rules — counting the number of organ donations achievable as a percentage of the total number of hospital patients under age 75 who die in that region from certain causes of death known to be favorable for organ donation.\\nBefore the rule change, OPOs could themselves determine whether a particular death should \"count\" as a potential candidate for organ donation. Critics of that older process say it made it hard to know why organ scarcities were occurring in some regions but not others.\\n\"This is about understanding why certain areas are not performing well and seeing if we can fix them,\" says Dr. Seth Karp, director of the transplant program at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.\\nHe says the new federal rules hold these nonprofits accountable for all the potential donors they may have missed.\\nHe notes that under the new accounting, Las Vegas yields roughly four times as many organ donations as New York City.\\n\"If it is true that certain parts of the country should only be able to recover one-fourth of the number of donors as another part of the country, because there are inherent differences in those areas of the country, that\\'s fine. We can live with that,\" he says. \"I just find that hard to believe.\"\\nThen there\\'s the other systemic problem that organ procurement officials say they have little control over, something the new rules don\\'t address: finding recipients for all the organs that are available.\\n\\n                Transplant surgeon Dr. Matthew Cooper cradles a donated kidney at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C., in 2016. Organ procurement is a delicate process, he says, requiring compassion and tact in talking with families after a loved one has died.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Molly Riley / AP\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nTransplant surgeon Dr. Matthew Cooper cradles a donated kidney at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C., in 2016. Organ procurement is a delicate process, he says, requiring compassion and tact in talking with families after a loved one has died.\\nFor example, earlier in December the New England OPO that stretches from Connecticut to Maine had the case of a 59-year-old who had suffered a fatal bicycle accident. That person\\'s family signed off on organ donation, and the region\\'s organ procurement organization considered the kidneys to be in good shape. But they got no takers.\\n\"We made thousands of organ offers and ultimately weren\\'t able to place those kidneys for transplant, despite ... almost 33,000 offers,\" says Alexandra Glazier, CEO of New England Donor Services.\\nOnce organs are turned down a few times, she says, other surgeons assume there must be something wrong with them, and also turn them down. A likely reason is that transplant centers have to contend with data assessments, too; they are rated by how many of their patients survive for a year or longer after transplant, among other measurements.\\nThat\\'s why Glazier questions whether the new rules meant to increase transplants will actually achieve that goal. The revised guidelines focus on organ procurement, but don\\'t subject surgeons and transplant centers to additional scrutiny of their decisions.\\n\"We know that there is opportunity to do a lot better system-wide,\" Glazier says. \"But what this requires is the full engagement of \\'the system.\\' \"\\nShe objects to another part of the new policy, too: Any low-performing OPO that doesn\\'t improve is subject to being taken over by a high performer. Glazier calls it a \"hunger games\" scenario that, in her view, could lead to even fewer organ transplants.\\nIt\\'s easy to point fingers, says Dr. Matthew Cooper. He directs kidney transplantation at Medstar Georgetown in Washington, D.C.\\nOrgan procurement organizations have a delicate job, he says.\\n\"Perhaps it\\'s not as simple as you think it is,\" he says. \"It\\'s not as simple for me as a transplant program to go to a donor family and say \"Listen, why aren\\'t you donating your organs?\\' I\\'d probably be really bad at that.\"\\nAnd Cooper worries that a punitive approach won\\'t benefit any of the nonprofits doing the work.\\n\"If we solely focus on one piece,\" Cooper says, \"I fear we\\'re going to have more chaos than we\\'re going to have value.\"\\nThis story comes from NPR\\'s health reporting partnership with Nashville Public Radio and Kaiser Health News. \\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

Meuthen criticized the party\\'s right wing in his speech. The AfD held the two-day congress in person, as total confirmed coronavirus infections passed the 1 million mark.\\nLike many other far-right political parties, Germany\\'s Alternative for Germany (AfD) was founded on outrage. It began as a response to the anger and fear some Germans felt when their stable and secure currency, the Deutsche Mark, was subsumed by the euro. It grew in popularity as it shifted its attention to immigration, and peaked when it attacked German Chancellor Angela Merkel\\'s decision to allow a record number of asylum seekers into Germany.\\nIn 2017, the AfD won 94 seats in the German parliament, the Bundestag. It became the country\\'s third-largest political party and the official opposition to the centrist coalition government. The AfD\\'s supporters and enemies alike expected the party might grow even stronger in the next election, in 2021.\\nThe pandemic of 2020 changed all that.\\nAfter polling around 15% for most of 2019, the AfD\\'s support plummeted this year. The latest surveys show it polling at around 9%.\\nAt first glance, this decline has a simple explanation. Like governments elsewhere, Germany\\'s ruling centrist coalition gained support as it confronted the coronavirus. Public approval of Merkel herself skyrocketed.\\nUwe Witt, an AfD member of the Bundestag, tells NPR the government stole the AfD\\'s thunder.\\n\\n                AfD parliamentary leader Alexander Gauland, shown here in the Bundestag on Oct. 29, has described the German government as a \"corona dictatorship\" with a \"war-cabinet\" attacking the basic rights and freedoms of the German people.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Maja Hitij/Getty Images\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nAfD parliamentary leader Alexander Gauland, shown here in the Bundestag on Oct. 29, has described the German government as a \"corona dictatorship\" with a \"war-cabinet\" attacking the basic rights and freedoms of the German people.\\n\"The main topics of the AfD — such as a greater stress on German national interests, closed European external borders, support of local small and medium-sized industry — were temporarily realized by the government during the corona pandemic,\" he says. \"That is why opposition parties always have polling losses in a crisis.\"\\nBut there is more behind the AfD\\'s current crisis.\\nThe AfD has made a significant U-turn in its approach to the pandemic. In March, the party\\'s parliamentary leader, Alexander Gauland, was complimentary about the Merkel-led government\\'s handling of the crisis. \"Government policy contains many insights that we believe are correct and that we share,\" Gauland told the Bundestag. Seven months later, though, he described the government as a \"corona dictatorship\" with a \"war cabinet\" attacking the basic rights and freedoms of the German people.\\nThe AfD\\'s attempts to reposition itself have exposed deep splits in the party and its leadership, and confusion about what its policies really are.\\n\"Right at the beginning of the pandemic, the AfD even criticized the federal government for not fighting the pandemic consistently enough,\" says political scientist Ursula Münch of Munich University. \"But since the AfD always strives for a unique selling point in political competition, it quickly decided to take a completely different course.\"\\nFor some AfD members, that new course meant cozying up to the Querdenker (\"lateral thinker\") movement — a loose grouping of libertarians, vaccination opponents and conspiracy theorists that has steadily gained support for its protest rallies against government health restrictions and lockdowns.\\n\\n                A demonstrator holds a sign saying Querdenker (\"lateral thinker\") during a protest against Germany\\'s coronavirus measures in Düsseldorf in September.

A recent poll showed that 24% of AfD supporters believe the \"pandemic is a conspiracy to oppress people.\"\\nMünch says the embrace of the Querdenker movement has hurt the AfD among its usual supporters. \"The \\'moderate\\' former AfD voters, who voted for the party mainly because they rejected Angela Merkel\\'s refugee policy, are obviously not looking to be ruled by populist gamblers,\" she says.\\nUndeterred, some AfD members have continued to push the new agenda, encouraging supporters to describe face coverings as \"a muzzle\" and attacking government health restrictions as arbitrary and inconsistent. Some data on the spread of the virus suggests Germany\\'s recent spike in COVID-19 infections is particularly severe in areas with a high proportion of AfD voters, although health experts caution that any apparent link needs a lot more research.\\nMatters came to a head in November, while the Bundestag discussed the government\\'s latest legislation aimed at controlling the pandemic as protesters tussled with police outside the parliament. Two AfD representatives invited some militant \"guests\" into the building, who then harassed and harangued other members of the Bundestag, including ministers.\\nThe episode was condemned by all the other parties and led to a rare apology from the AfD leadership.\\nDuring the AfD\\'s convention, also in November, its co-leader Jörg Meuthen criticized the right wing of the party, its proximity to the Querdenker movement and use of the term \"corona dictatorship.\" Gauland later claimed that Meuthen had rejected half the party with his speech.\\nAt this point, there are two wings of the AfD fighting each other, says Münch. \"Some want to get out of the ungrateful role of the opposition and participate in government,\" she explains. \"The others despise this accommodation of the system they hate and want to become more radical.\"\\nMünch predicts the AfD will perform significantly worse in next fall\\'s election than it did in 2017.\\n\"Although the relatively small group of hardcore AfD supporters remains set,\" she says, \"more moderate voters could be deterred by the party\\'s quarrels and self-centeredness.\"\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

Now, this massive influx of migrants and refugees is creating a backlash in Colombia, with some people blaming the newcomers for a host of problems, including rising crime, unemployment and the spread of COVID-19.\\nThe message that Venezuelan migrants are no longer welcome comes from average Colombian citizens and powerful government officials alike. Last week, for example, Colombian President Iván Duque announced that undocumented Venezuelan migrants would not receive vaccinations for the coronavirus despite concerns from refugee agencies that this policy could lead to more infections.\\n\"Of course they won\\'t get it,\" Duque told a Bogotá radio station. \"Otherwise we would have a stampede with the whole world crossing the border to get vaccinated.\"\\nResearch shows that Venezuelans in Colombia are more likely to be the victims of crime rather than the perpetrators. But after a Venezuelan migrant stabbed to death a bus passenger in Bogotá in October, Mayor Claudia López declared: \"I don\\'t want to stigmatize immigrants but there are some Venezuelans involved in crimes who are making our lives impossible.\"\\nMeanwhile, local officials all across Colombia complain that they\\'ve been left largely on their own to deal with a flood of sick and impoverished Venezuelans.

In the 1980s and 1990s, oil-rich Venezuela provided safe haven and jobs to thousands of Colombians fleeing a drug-fueled guerrilla war.\\nBut attitudes are changing now that the exodus of Venezuelans has become the largest refugee crisis in Latin American history and rivals the magnitude of the Syrian refugee crisis. A recent Gallup poll showed that 69% of Colombians have an unfavorable perception of Venezuelan migrants.\\nAmong those who have soured on Venezuelans are many residents and officials Pamplona. Home to 60,000 people and located on the main highway to Bogotá and other major cities, Pamplona has become a pit stop for migrants, with some 300 arriving here every day.\\n\"Pamplona is overflowing with migrants and we have no way to deal with it,\" says Humberto Pisciotti, the mayor of Pamplona, which is located near Colombia\\'s busiest border crossing with Venezuela. In an interview with NPR, he added: \"Now we have chaos.\"\\nMany beg for food at houses and restaurants or seek medical care at the town\\'s hospital. Some walk around without face masks. Due to the lack of a shelter for refugees, they sleep outdoors and bathe in rivers and streams.\\nTo dissuade them from bunking down near their homes, some residents pour used motor oil on sidewalks and driveways while town officials have cordoned off parks with yellow tape. Still, the sight of the forlorn campers can provoke xenophobic outbursts.\\n\"They come here at night like rats,\" says Carlos Espitia, 62, a retired welder, who complains that migrants have taken over the sidewalk in front of his house. \"I have to clean up their poop.\"\\n\\n                Pamplona resident Nelson Maldonado helped organize a demonstration against the town\\'s plan to open a shelter for the migrants.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    John Otis for NPR\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nPamplona resident Nelson Maldonado helped organize a demonstration against the town\\'s plan to open a shelter for the migrants.\\nNearly all the migrants leave after a day or two, but town officials say a small number have joined street gangs that sell drugs and rob stores.

The protesters feared the shelter would attract even more Venezuelans to their town and, after they blocked roads for several hours, Pisciotti, the mayor, announced that he had scrapped the plan.\\n\"I\\'m not xenophobic,\" Pisciotti said. \"But I can\\'t go against the community.\"\\nEven townsfolk who lend a helping hand to Venezuelans have come in for criticism.\\nAmong them is Marta Duque, who, with the help of international agencies, runs an aid station out of her cramped house on the edge of Pamplona.

Explaining his decision to leave his homeland, Páez points out that his weekly salary as a baker in Caracas was worth less than a dollar — not even enough to buy a bag of rice. His possessions now amount to a small backpack stuffed with clothes and two peaches that he pulls from his pants pockets.\\nTurning to the police, Páez begs them to allow him to continue his journey on foot toward Bogotá.\\n\"I\\'ve been walking for two days,\" he says, \"and now you are going to send me back?\"\\nIgnoring his pleas, the police put Páez and the other migrants aboard trucks bound for the Venezuelan border.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

Here, the member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts is seen in 2016, at the end of a fashion show marking 70 years of his creations at the Institut de France in Paris.\\nFrench designer Pierre Cardin, who extended his brand far beyond the fashion world, has died at age 98. The son of Italian immigrants worked with luminaries such as filmmaker Jean Cocteau and designer Christian Dior before launching his own fashion house, drawing on his love for futuristic design.\\nCardin\\'s family announced his death to Agence France-Presse on Tuesday. The French Académie des Beaux-Arts also issued several statements mourning his passing.\\n\"Immense sadness,\" the academy\\'s secretary general Cyril Barthalois said via Twitter, adding, \"Equally great joy of having known him\" through the academy.\\nCardin was known for his forward-thinking designs, helping shape what we now see as space-age aesthetics: Clean, curved lines. Bold, beautiful colors contrasted with black tights and leggings. Helmets, visors and experimental materials that exuded both a sense of adventure and a knowing playfulness.\\n\\n                Pierre Cardin poses at the inauguration of the Pierre Cardin Museum in Paris in 2014.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Jacques Brinon/AP\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nPierre Cardin poses at the inauguration of the Pierre Cardin Museum in Paris in 2014.\\nIn the 1960s, Cardin\\'s simple, high-collared suits were a hit with the Beatles.

His parents moved to France between the two world wars, and the young Cardin worked designing costumes and masks for Cocteau\\'s 1946 film Beauty and the Beast. Then he started tailoring for Dior. By 1950, Cardin was out on his own, making a name for himself in the world of haute couture.\\nIn 1959, Cardin released a mass-produced ready-to-wear collection with the French department store Printemps. While common today, it was a bold move back then — one that got Cardin kicked out of the small syndicate of haute couture designers. But Cardin had his eye toward getting the world to know his name.\\nThrough licensing and branding deals, the words \"Pierre Cardin\" have appeared on clothes, furniture, perfume, accessories, cars — even frying pans, as NPR has reported.\\nWhile these licensing deals drew criticism that the great designer was diluting his brand, the tactic also gave Cardin\\'s name and influence a far-reaching legacy.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

It\\'s a social life and a community, an athletic center and a place to get meals that aren\\'t available at home. The coronavirus pandemic has disrupted — and continues to disrupt — the lives of U.S. students in profound ways.\\nMany kids haven\\'t set foot in their schools since March, when most in-person schooling shut down across the United States. Teachers are working tirelessly to educate their students online, but they are growing increasingly anxious about the kids who aren\\'t showing up at all.\\nAn estimated 3 million students may have dropped out of school learning since March, according to Bellwether Education Partners, a national nonprofit that focuses on underserved youth. The group\\'s study cited a lack of Internet access, housing insecurity, disabilities and language barriers as major obstacles to attending virtual classes during the pandemic.\\n\"It is really, really unsettling,\" says Alex, a teacher in western Virginia, who asked that her last name not be used for fear of repercussions for speaking out. \"I think people don\\'t realize how much we need to see these kids. A lot of times in schools, we are the first line for seeing signs of child abuse, for seeing signs of food insecurity. And you don\\'t have that with virtual students. Especially when they ghost.\"\\nThat \"ghosting\" is a constant problem for school employees who track attendance in both urban and rural districts. Staying connected to students with little to no Internet access has become impossible in many cases.\\n\"They find ways to disappear when they don\\'t want to be found,\" says Karen Smith, who has been an educator for more than three decades and teaches high school English in a rural area on Maryland\\'s Eastern Shore.\\n\"Many of our students and even our faculty and staff don\\'t have reliable Internet,\" she says. \"We experimented with portable Wi-Fi, and in our neck of the woods, that\\'s not really a feasible thing because you have to have a signal to bounce off of. And in some cases, they\\'re rural enough that they don\\'t have that option.\"\\nLocated about 150 miles northwest of Smith\\'s school district, Baltimore might seem like a different world. But families in Evan Murray\\'s urban school district face many of the same challenges.\\n\"The Wi-Fi has been problematic for everybody,\" says Murray, who has worked in education for 13 years. He\\'s now employed by Baltimore City Public Schools as a community school site specialist, communicating with students and their families about what they need for both their academic and nonacademic lives.\\nSmith\\'s and Murray\\'s two Maryland communities have nearly identical poverty levels, hovering just above 20%. So when a student is absent, missed lessons aren\\'t the only concern.\\n\"Our kids already rely on the teachers and the staff for a lot of different levels of support,\" such as food and health care resources, Murray says.\\n\"We have a bunch of kids who rely on the morning breakfast and lunch programs to eat throughout the day,\" he continues. \"We need to communicate and check on our babies, our scholars, and make sure they\\'re fine.\"\\nSmith, in rural Maryland, is worried about that too.\\n\"It\\'s really created a hardship for those families, and I think that is one of the reasons that there\\'s been such a push to go back to school in person,\" she says, also noting that schools act as child care for many working parents.\\nThe pandemic has made life unpredictable, and teachers see that reflected in class participation.\\n\"Some of the students are in and out of touch,\" says Smith. \"There\\'s one student that I haven\\'t heard from her in, I don\\'t know how long.\"\\nSmith says she has been trying to reach the student by phone but senses that she might be dealing with a precarious family situation.\\n\"I think they\\'re hesitant to be upfront about what\\'s going on at home sometimes,\" she says.\\nLast week, Smith lost her own Internet access at home about 10 minutes before class was supposed to start. After that, she decided to start working out of the empty school building. The loud, buzzing hallways she remembers, filled with young voices and bodies, are now silent. After a few minutes, the motion-sensitive lights go off.\\nOne thing she and her colleagues often think about is how they don\\'t necessarily even know what their students look like.\\n\"They could walk in my room, face-to-face, and I would have absolutely no idea,\" she says. \"I don\\'t even know if I\\'ve heard their voices.\"\\nBefore the pandemic, Murray of the Baltimore schools says he spent a lot of time doing things like getting uniforms for kids and making parents feel involved. Now, his job deals largely with technology issues — getting tablets and other equipment out to students\\' homes, assuming he has the correct address.\\nOtherwise, he spends much of his workday on the phone, trying to track down students who have fallen off the grid.\\nOn a recent day, he says he spent two hours — from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. — trying to contact 13 kids. \"We have to, because there are still a number of students we haven\\'t gotten, we haven\\'t made contact with.\"\\nThere are wrong numbers, kids who are tracked down to a different state, and home visits — when they were happening — where no one comes to the door.\\nEchoing Smith\\'s experience in rural Maryland, Murray says he thinks there is shame or embarrassment, from students or their families, behind those unanswered messages and knocks on the doors.\\nAnd amid worries that some of the temporary student absences could become permanent, Murray says schools need to be relentless in their outreach efforts.\\n\"You can\\'t go in this like you\\'re waiting and wishing for students to come back,\" he says. \"It\\'s not going to happen.\"\\nJolie Myers edited the audio story.

He\\'s an outreach worker with Healthy Little Havana, going door to door to talk to people about getting tested for COVID-19.\\nLittle Havana is a neighborhood in Miami that, until the pandemic, was known for its active street life along Calle Ocho, including live music venues. There you can find examples of the quintessential ventanita serving Cuban coffee and a historic park where men gather to play dominoes.\\nBut during the pandemic, a local group called Healthy Little Havana is zeroing in on this area with a very specific assignment: convincing residents to get a coronavirus test.\\nThe nonprofit has lots of outreach experience. It helped with the local count for the 2020 Census, for example, and because of the pandemic did most of that work by phone. But this new challenge, community leaders say, needs a face-to-face approach.\\nThe group\\'s outreach workers have been heading out almost daily to walk the quiet residential streets, to convince as many people as possible to get tested for the coronavirus. On a recent afternoon, a group of three — Elvis Mendes, María Elena González and Alejandro Díaz — knocked on door after door at a two-story apartment building. Many people here have jobs in the service industry, retail or construction; most of them aren\\'t home when visitors come calling.\\nLisette Mejía did answer her door, holding a baby in her arms, and flanked by two small children.\\n\"Not everyone has easy access to the internet or the ability to look for appointments,\" Mejía replied, after being asked why she hadn\\'t gotten a test. She added that she hasn\\'t had any symptoms, either.\\nThe Healthy Little Havana team gave her some cotton masks and told her about pop-up testing planned for that weekend at an elementary school just a short walk away. They explained that people might lack symptoms, but still have the virus.\\nFor many low-income Miamians, getting a coronavirus test is still too difficult \\nThe nonprofit organization is one of several receiving funding from the Health Foundation of South Florida. The foundation is spending $1.5 million on these outreach efforts, in part to help make coronavirus testing as accessible and convenient as possible.\\nThere are a number of social and economic reasons that make it difficult for some Miamians to get tested, treated, or isolate themselves if they are sick with COVID-19. One big problem is that many people say they can\\'t afford to stay home when they\\'re sick.\\n\"People usually rather go to work than actually treat themselves — because they have to pay rent, they have to pay school expenses, food,\" says Elvis Mendes.\\nThis part of Miami is home to many Cuban exiles, as well as people from all over Latin America. Some of them don\\'t have health insurance, while others are undocumented immigrants.\\n\\n                In their canvassing of a predominantly Cuban American neighborhood in October, Díaz (right) and another community outreach worker, María Elena González (left), spoke with Gloria Carvajal about how to get a COVID-19 test.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Verónica Zaragovia/WLRN\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nIn their canvassing of a predominantly Cuban American neighborhood in October, Díaz (right) and another community outreach worker, María Elena González (left), spoke with Gloria Carvajal about how to get a COVID-19 test.\\nSo Mendes and his team try to spread the word among residents here about programs like Ready Responders, a group of paramedics that now has foundation funding to give free coronavirus tests at home in areas like this one, regardless of immigration status.\\n\"Our mission is for all these people to get tested — regardless if they have a symptom or not — so we can diminish the level of people getting COVID-19,\" Mendes explains. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Protection, people who are infected but presymptomatic or asymptomatic account for more than 50% of transmissions.\\nThe Health Foundation of South Florida\\'s coronavirus-related grants have ranged from $35,000 to $160,000; other recipients include the South Florida chapter of the National Medical Association, Centro Campesino and the YMCA of South Florida.\\nThe foundation is focusing on low-income neighborhoods where some residents might not have access to a car, or be able to afford to pay for a coronavirus test at a pharmacy. Their focus includes residential areas near agriculture work sites. In Miami-Dade County, the foundation is working with county officials directly to increase testing. In nearby Broward County, the foundation is collaborating with public housing authorities to bring more testing into people\\'s homes.\\nIn Spanish, soothing fears about testing and offering free options \\nIt\\'s time-consuming to go door-to-door, but worthwhile: Residents respond when outreach teams speak their language and make a personal connection.\\nIn Little Havana, resident Gloria Carvajal told the outreach group that she felt anxious about whether the PCR test is painful.\\n\"What about that stick they put all the way up?\" Carvajal asked, laughing nervously.\\nMaría Elena González jumped in to reassure her that it\\'s not so bad: \"I\\'ve done it many times, because obviously we\\'re out and about in public and so we have to get the test done.\"\\n\\n                At a November memorial to lives lost to COVID-19 in the Liberty City neighborhood of Miami, Rev.

The church hosted a day of free testing back in October, with help from the foundation.\\n\"You know us.

Protesters urged lawmakers to ban evictions for several months.\\nThe New York Legislature approved a sweeping eviction ban for tenants living in the state, giving residents fearful of losing their homes during the pandemic some relief at least until May.\\nThe law, which Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed late Monday, places a moratorium on residential evictions until May 1 for tenants who endured a \"COVID-related hardship.\" Tenants must show documentation explaining their situation to prevent evictions. Landlords can still evict people who don\\'t show that documentation.\\nThe law also stops residential foreclosure proceedings until May 1. Homeowners and landlords who own 10 or fewer residences can also file hardship declarations with their mortgage lender or a court to prevent a foreclosure. \\n\"When the COVID-19 pandemic began, we asked New Yorkers to protect each other by staying at home. As we fight our way through the marathon this pandemic has become, we need to make sure New Yorkers still have homes to provide that protection,\" Cuomo said after signing the bill.\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\'s nationwide temporary ban on residential evictions expires early next year. It was set to expire Dec. 31, but Congress extended that moratorium for another month in the latest coronavirus relief bill just signed by President Trump. Federal lawmakers also put $25 billion into rental assistance programs. \\nNew York, like many states in the country, is facing high rates of unemployment caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Tenant advocacy groups have protested for months, urging lawmakers to do more to prevent people from losing their homes.\\nA report by the National Council of State Housing Agencies earlier this year estimated U.S. renters will owe up to $34 billion in past-due rent by January. This is set to increase eviction filings and impose financial hardship on millions in just a few months, the organization said.\\nMany of those tenants struggling to pay rent in New York are in communities of color, according to Stanley Fritz, political director of Citizen Action of New York. He said in a statement Monday that Black and brown tenants are \"three to four times as likely to be facing eviction as their white counterparts.\"\\nHe said passing the eviction ban is an \"important first step\" to helping the 1.4 million tenant households behind on rent. \\nLandlord critics\\nThe long-term economic impact of unpaid rent for landlords has organizations representing building owners criticizing the new law. \\nJay Martin, executive director of the landlord group Community Housing Improvement Program, accused tenant advocates of having a broader political agenda by pushing the bill.\\nDays before the bill was signed, Martin tweeted that an eviction moratorium is just \"kicking the can down the road.\"\\nHe tweeted, \"Eviction moratoriums do not address the fundamental problem of the costs of housing. A problem for owners and renters.\"\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

Scott Applewhite/AP\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nElection cases are among those before the U.S. Supreme Court, though none that will change President Trump\\'s defeat.\\nIn January, the U.S. Supreme Court embarks on the second half of a term with a fortified 6-to-3 conservative majority. But unlike the first half of the term, there will be no norm-busting President Trump often railing at the court\\'s election decisions. In tone, President Biden probably will be the functional opposite, but his policies are likely to be greeted with more skepticism.\\nFor decades, the court\\'s five-justice conservative majority was split between those who wanted to move slowly in a more conservative direction and others who wanted to move more aggressively. But now, with the more centrist conservatives retired and three Trump appointees on the court, there is a conservative supermajority of six, meaning one vote to spare.\\nNo longer, as during the last term, does the reliably conservative but more incrementalist Chief Justice John Roberts have the controlling vote. The other five can now prevail without him.\\nBottom line: The current court may well turn out to be the most conservative since the 1930s.\\n\"On religion, abortion, gun rights and race, for example, there is a solid majority to change the law and ... move whip quick,\" says Supreme Court advocate and SCOTUSblog publisher Tom Goldstein.\\nObamacare and religion\\nAlready argued this term, but not decided yet, are two big cases. One tests whether the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, must be struck down entirely because one provision — the so-called mandate — was eliminated by Congress. But the law, including the mandate, has already been upheld twice before by the high court.\\nRepublicans in Congress have failed dozens of times to kill the ACA, even when they controlled the House, the Senate and the White House. In the meantime, Obamacare has become a very popular program, and if the court were to declare the entire law invalid at this late date, Republicans could end up in the position of a dog that chases the car for years and finally catches it. It could be bloody.\\nThe other case heard earlier this term tests whether the city of Philadelphia may refuse to award some foster care contracts to Catholic Social Services because CSS, based on religious objections, refuses to screen LGBT couples, as required by the city\\'s anti-discrimination laws.\\nThe tea leaves, as of now, indicate CSS will win. If so, the power of government to make contracts — the one area long viewed as relatively immune to religious challenges — would become fair game for religious objectors.\\nIt would be \"quite a significant departure from what the court might have done 15 or 20 years ago,\" observes professor Josh Blackman of South Texas College of Law Houston and co-author of An Introduction to Constitutional Law: 100 Supreme Court Cases Everyone Should Know.\\nA decision in favor of CSS would also be quite a departure from the court\\'s 1990 decision written by conservative icon Antonin Scalia. That 6-to-3 ruling declared that a valid and neutrally applied law is constitutional even if it has some incidental negative effects on some religious groups. As Scalia put it back then, allowing exceptions to every state law or regulation affecting religion \"would open the prospect of constitutionally required religious exemptions from civic obligations of almost every conceivable kind.\"\\nStill, the current court appears headed in the direction that Scalia warned against. Indeed, even before the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, there was a firm conservative majority in religious liberty cases.\\nThe only religious liberty case in which Chief Justice Roberts split with fellow conservatives involved the public health measures that governors have taken during the pandemic. Early on, Roberts sided with the liberals in allowing governors to limit attendance at religious services in order to curb the spread of the coronavirus. But that was before the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\\nIn what could be a harbinger of things to come, Roberts\\' vote became irrelevant after Barrett joined the court and provided a fifth vote against Gov. Andrew Cuomo\\'s actions in New York. Similar orders limiting church and synagogue attendance were soon struck down.\\nExecutive power\\nOn a different question, the executive power of the presidency, the Supreme Court\\'s conservative majority has generally deferred to Trump\\'s muscular assertions of presidential power. So, will the conservative court majority be similarly deferential to Biden?\\n\"I think the short answer is no,\" says University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck. \"Some of that is going to reflect ... the fact that the court will be more suspicious and skeptical of some of the policies that the Biden administration attempts to pursue by executive order.\"\\nSCOTUSblog\\'s Goldstein agrees, noting that \"historically, the Supreme Court\\'s view about whether a president has powers [to do certain things] has tended to track whether the justices in the majority like the president and his policies.\" Goldstein adds that it will be \"really fascinating\" to see whether a court that has \"breathed more life\" into presidential powers \"will stick with that even if they don\\'t like the policies of a much more liberal president.\"\\nBoth Goldstein and Vladeck note, however, that the conservative majority has been cutting back on the regulatory power of administrative agencies to carry out objectives spelled out in legislation. That trend, they observe, is likely to increase, making it more difficult for agencies to make rules carrying out everything from environmental to consumer protection laws.\\n\"This term is like an iceberg,\" says Goldstein. \"There are big cases above the surface,\" like the ACA case. But below the surface, there are cases being pushed by big business that could make it hard for \"the little guy\" to go to court and harder for agencies to enact regulations. If big business prevails, he maintains, \"it\\'ll be an earthquake\" in terms of consequences.\\nAbortion and guns\\nOn the hot-button issues of abortion, guns and race, the court\\'s conservative majority is most likely to start moving aggressively next term and thereafter.\\nWill Roe v. Wade, the court\\'s 47-year-old abortion rights precedent, be overturned? There are two schools of thought on that. One is that the court will systematically hollow out the right to abortion so that it is a right on paper only.\\nThe other school of thought is that leaving Roe a shell is not enough for those opposed to abortion. \"There is, I think, a galvanizing view within the pro-life movement that the time has come to call the question,\" observes New York University law professor Melissa Murray.\\nIf Roe is to be overturned, however, it likely will take more than a year or two to come to fruition. Former Obama-era Solicitor General Donald Verrilli has said that he thinks it likely will happen within five years or so.\\nOn guns, though, the court looks — for the first time — to have a clear majority that is hostile to gun regulation. Last term, the court once again punted, and punted again on the issue, declining to hear 10 gun-rights cases. Presumably, Chief Justice Roberts\\' then-deciding vote was still in doubt.\\nBut now, with Barrett newly on the court and Ginsburg gone, there appear to be five conservative votes ready to march down the path of expansive gun rights, and Second Amendment activists are teeing up new cases.\\n\"I can tell you people are getting more aggressive,\" says professor Blackman, a gun-rights advocate. Gun-rights groups \"are emboldened to try to push new frontiers\" now.\\nElection cases and race plus affirmative action\\nElection cases are also before the court, though none that will undo Trump\\'s defeat. But, left over from Trump\\'s fight, there is a possible case from Pennsylvania testing whether state supreme courts have the authority to interpret state laws and state constitutions in federal elections. The justices declined to review the case prior to the election — and affected ballots, relatively few in number, would not have changed the outcome. But the justices may yet agree to hear the case to resolve the issue.\\nAlso on the docket are cases involving state laws that make it more difficult to vote. In 2013, the high court struck down a key part of the Voting Rights Act. Roberts confidently wrote, \"Our country has changed,\" and he said that the protections in the law were no longer needed. Within days, though, Republican-dominated state legislatures in the South began writing new laws that made it, once again, more difficult to vote, and they started redrawing legislative lines to further limit minority influence in state and federal legislatures.\\nSo, will that reality on the ground have any influence in the current voting rights cases before the court? No, say voting rights experts.\\nUT\\'s Vladeck says that while the current court did hold the line against Trump\\'s post-election attempts to change the outcome, the court\\'s conservatives believe states should be free to enact pre-election laws that restrict early voting and voting by mail, while at the same time allowing states to purge voting roles and tighten voter ID requirements. The conservative majority does not see such restrictions as aimed at intentionally stacking the deck against poor and minority voters.\\n\"For the chief justice and easily a majority of this conservative Supreme Court, their views about race are fully baked,\" says SCOTUSblog\\'s Goldstein.\\nIn the same vein, by next term the court will likely hear arguments in one of several cases testing affirmative action in higher-education admissions. The court, for a half-century, has repeatedly ruled that some consideration of race in college admissions is permissible, but a racial quota is not.\\nBut now, there may well be a conservative majority to reverse those rulings and bar all consideration of racial diversity in college admissions. After that, affirmative action in employment could be next.\\nIn the coming year, other key developments also could shape the Supreme Court\\'s future.\\nRetirements on the horizon?\\nEighty-two-year-old Justice Stephen Breyer, one of the court\\'s three remaining liberals, could step down. But he may feel constrained by the fact that Republicans currently control the U.S. Senate, and GOP leader Mitch McConnell has never hesitated to use his power as Senate majority leader to block or advance Supreme Court nominees based solely on whether the nominating president is a fellow Republican or a Democrat.\\nSo, Breyer might stay his hand. If, however, the Democrats win two Senate seats in Georgia in January, giving Democrats the upper hand in the Senate for the first time in 10 years, Breyer may well pull the trigger on retirement.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

Rowling, is being accused of misusing millions of dollars in federal pandemic relief funds meant to keep workers on payroll.\\n\\n                The Omni William Penn Hotel in Pittsburgh is one of a number of hotels in the Omni Hotels & Resorts chain that accepted federal Paycheck Protection Program funds but did not use them to pay workers.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Bill O\\'Driscoll/WESA\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nThe Omni William Penn Hotel in Pittsburgh is one of a number of hotels in the Omni Hotels & Resorts chain that accepted federal Paycheck Protection Program funds but did not use them to pay workers.\\nUnite Here, a service workers union with more than 300,000 members in North America, said several Omni hotels where it represents workers took Paycheck Protection Program loans but never paid hundreds of workers.\\nUnite Here said 32 Omni hotels received about $76 million in loans from the program, known as PPP. About $23 million of that went to seven hotels, in cities including Chicago, Boston, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, where the union represents more than 1,000 housekeepers, servers and other service workers.\\nIn its application to the Small Business Administration, the Omni Providence Hotel in Rhode Island asked for a $2.6 million PPP loan, promising to retain 246 jobs.\\nQuilcia Moronta, a health club attendant, was laid off after working at the hotel for 21 years. She applied for unemployment benefits and food stamps and was hopeful when the hotel\\'s loan was approved on April 13.\\n\"As I was struggling to provide for my family, I learned that the Omni had received some PPP money,\" said Moronta, a single mother with two children. \"I said, \\'Great, at least they\\'re gonna help us get by when it comes to basic needs.\\' \"\\nEight months later, unemployment benefits for Moronta and other workers have expired, and health coverage is long gone. And they are still waiting for PPP benefits.\\n\"Right now, here we are in December, and we haven\\'t heard anything about Omni using that money to help their employees,\" she said.\\n\"Here in Boston, I\\'ve spoken to hundreds of workers who work at the Omni Parker House, and I know none of them have received a single dime of this money,\" said Carlos Aramayo, Unite Here\\'s executive vice president. \"Looking at this winter, a lot of them could really use it.\"\\nZebedee Williams was laid off in March from his job as an overnight banquet houseman at the Omni William Penn Hotel in Pittsburgh. He said that since unemployment benefits and weekly supplemental assistance from the federal government ran out, he has struggled to feed his household, which includes a partner on disability and three daughters. To stretch the budget, he said, he has skipped meals.\\n\"It\\'s not right for the kids not to eat,\" Williams said. \"I would do it 10 times again if the situation happened. I would make sure my children eat. I would make do.\"\\nIn a written statement, a spokesperson for the Dallas-based chain said workers at the hotels had not been retained because the facilities were either closed or operating at greatly reduced capacity.\\nPPP was part of the CARES Act, the huge pandemic-relief package President Trump signed in March. Some 5.2 million businesses have secured $523 billion in PPP loans. Though the Small Business Administration program was meant to help small businesses keep workers paid — as an alternative to unemployment — it has been widely criticized for favoring large businesses and been stung with allegations of fraud.\\nPPP rules do permit a business to use funds for payroll even if it is closed. But the Omni elected not to do that. Instead, the chain said in its statement, \"any amount of the PPP loans that are not forgiven will be returned or repaid with interest per program terms.\"\\n\\n                Quilcia Moronta (right), who was laid off from the Omni Providence Hotel last spring, with her children, Gabriela and Gabriel.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Quilcia Moronta\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nQuilcia Moronta (right), who was laid off from the Omni Providence Hotel last spring, with her children, Gabriela and Gabriel.\\nCritics say whether the hotels pay back the loans is beside the point. They note, for instance, that the interest rate on PPP loans is just 1% — well below market rate.\\n\"It\\'s disgusting if companies want to use this as a way to get a low-interest loan from the federal government,\" says Unite Here\\'s Aramayo. \"It\\'s really not fair for a company to take money that was intended to help out their own workforce and use it for some other purpose.\"\\nOmni\\'s use of the funds is \"obviously really contravening the spirit of what this [program] was about,\" said Harry J. Van Buren, a professor of business ethics at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minn. \"Even if they do repay the loan, the fact that they got awfully close to free money for some period of time is really an advantage to them as well.\"\\n\"I do think about other businesses that maybe didn\\'t get money because Omni did, either truly small businesses that were struggling or another company that might have used it to actually pay their workers,\" said Lisa Gilbert, executive vice president of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. \"It doesn\\'t seem like a great investment of taxpayer dollars, even if they pay back the money at the end of the day.\"\\nOn Dec. 8, Aramayo wrote to the Small Business Administration and the Treasury Department, urging them to scrutinize PPP loans to Omni hotels, \"especially if [the borrowers] apply for forgiveness.\" It was just weeks before Trump signed into law a new pandemic-relief package with its own version of the Paycheck Protection Program — one with new rules to help address some of the problems critics found with the first iteration.\\nAn earlier version of this story said the University of St. Thomas was in Minneapolis.

And despite fundraising advantages almost everywhere, their efforts to take back a number of state legislatures fizzled. \\n\"It\\'s pretty unique that you don\\'t pick up down ballot when you have such a resounding success at the top of the ticket,\" said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake.\\nThat\\'s the big mystery of this election: Why the disparity between Biden\\'s decisive win and Democrats\\' disappointing down-ballot performance?\\nUsually the party that loses the White House conducts a self-examination to figure out what went wrong and how it can do better next time. But as Trump continues to falsely claim he didn\\'t lose, and as many Republicans are feeling triumphant that the trouncing they expected didn\\'t materialize, it\\'s the Democrats trying to figure out what happened. The results are offering the party five possible lessons.\\n1. Ticket-splitting isn\\'t totally extinct\\nThe simplest explanation for Democrats\\' down-ballot disappointment is that many voters split their tickets. They rejected Trump but didn\\'t embrace the Democrats. Data suggests there wasn\\'t much ticket-splitting, but there may have been just enough to help Republicans in just the right places.\\n\\n                Many Maine voters split their tickets, as Biden won the state easily, but Republican Sen. Susan Collins also won reelection handily.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Robert F. Bukaty/AP\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nMany Maine voters split their tickets, as Biden won the state easily, but Republican Sen. Susan Collins also won reelection handily.\\nDespite years of gridlock in Washington, some voters still like the checks and balances of divided government, according to Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist in South Carolina.\\n\"I\\'ve talked to a number of people who said they want to send a message to Donald Trump, but they also want to send a message about what they felt like was working for them locally,\" he said. \"They knew how to separate the national from the local in this election cycle. It did not work out as well for us.\"\\nA lot of the congressional districts the Democrats lost this year were districts Trump won, but they also lost eight districts where Biden won.\\n\"Six of those districts that we lost are majority people of color districts,\" said Chuck Rocha, a Democratic strategist who advised Bernie Sanders during the primary. \"These are all majority Latino, Black and Asian seats that we lost, when that used to be the backbone of what the Democratic Party was.\"\\nRocha points out that there was one big exception: Arizona. That\\'s where the next lesson may lie.\\n2. Democrats\\' lagging support with Latinos could have been prevented\\nBiden won Arizona with a big majority of Latino voters. Democrats picked up a Senate seat, lost no House seats, and they even picked up one seat in the state legislature. \\nRocha says that\\'s because Democrats did things in Arizona that they neglected to do in other states with large Latino populations, like Florida, California or Texas.\\n\\n                Biden won Arizona\\'s Maricopa County, helping to flip the state to Democrats in the presidential race.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Matt York/AP\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nBiden won Arizona\\'s Maricopa County, helping to flip the state to Democrats in the presidential race.\\n\"You need a candidate who makes a commitment to talk to our community early and often,\" he said. \"So Joe Biden goes up [on television] there in the end of June and spends millions of dollars on Spanish-language communications and never comes off the air.\"\\nThere were also a number of Latino political organizations in Arizona telling voters — in Spanish — why they should be voting for Biden.\\n\"TV, radio, digital, mail — robust infrastructure on the ground with people talking to people from the community to the community, like LUCHA, like Mi Familia Vota. Arizona is one of the only states that had all three components all year long,\" Rocha said. \\n3. A bigger, more diverse electorate isn\\'t a slam dunk for Democrats\\nThis election belied two core political assumptions for Democrats. The first is that as the electorate gets more diverse, Democrats automatically do better. Not so fast.\\n\"There are a lot of Democrats who believe demography is destiny, and that\\'s true and nice if you\\'ve got 50 years. But if you\\'ve got six months or 18 months, demography is not destiny yet,\" pollster Lake said. \"This is not a sea change; this is a glacial change.\"\\nThe second bit of conventional wisdom punctured this year is that high turnout helps Democrats.\\n\"Universally, high turnout does not help the Democrats,\" Lake said. \"It depends on who\\'s turning out.\"\\nRepublicans — at least when Trump is on the ballot — were a lot better at getting their voters out than Democrats expected, with the \"blue wave\" of the 2018 midterms failing to wash ashore again this year. It\\'s similar to the pattern of Barack Obama\\'s presidency, when Democrats turned out big in presidential years, but Republicans dominated in the midterms.\\n4. Simplify the message\\nDemocrats say they also need a way to fight back when Republicans brand them as dangerous \"socialists\" who want to \"defund the police.\" Only a small handful of progressive candidates were actually in favor of defunding the police. A majority of House Democrats, along with Biden, rejected that slogan, but they couldn\\'t stop it from being weaponized against all of them.\\nThat failure, says Rocha, is on the Democrats.\\n\"There\\'s no way that that helps you,\" he said. \"There\\'s just such a better way to get in front of that. Black men are being killed in the street by cops and we are filming it, and we can\\'t think of the right way to say that that has to change? It\\'s just — it\\'s disgusting that we would let that happen.\"\\nMany Democrats admit they need a simpler, more populist message on the economy, starting with policies that have broad bipartisan support, like infrastructure, debt-free college and a $15-per-hour minimum wage, which 61% of Florida voters approved in November as Trump won their state by 3 points.\\n\"Donald Trump, he put his policy on the front of a red hat. That\\'s how he did it,\" Rocha said. \"Like, we\\'ve got to get a lot more simplistic about our messaging and bring it way back down to where working-class people can understand who\\'s with them and who\\'s against them.\" \\nThe key for Democrats, he thinks, is an economic message that speaks to both non-college-educated white voters and people of color, and that can help Democrats expand their appeal geographically.\\n5. The cities and suburbs are not enough\\nSuburbs are the new battleground, and Democrats did do very well in them. But for Democrats to achieve a true governing majority, they need a broader geographic reach.\\n\"We should take a lot of lessons from how Joe Biden put together a winning coalition, and we have to expand that, particularly in more exurban and rural areas,\" said Mark Riddle, a Democratic strategist who runs the Future Majority PAC. \"There are parts of our country that see things differently, and we have to have a larger conversation with them in order to get more seats.\"\\nThe challenges of taking office without a clear governing majority may become apparent very quickly, and overcoming them presents Biden and his party with a lot of familiar hurdles.\\n\"If you\\'re looking at 2022, we\\'re going to have to win in Wisconsin. We have to win in Pennsylvania again. We\\'re gonna have to win in Michigan,\" Riddle said. \"It\\'s the same battleground.\"\\nExcept next time, Democrats won\\'t have Trump to run against the way they did so successfully in 2018. Typically, the incumbent president\\'s party loses seats in Congress during the midterms.\\nSo with all the other lessons, Democrats are going to have to figure out how to defy history over the next two years if they want to turn a demographic majority into a political majority that\\'s big enough to actually govern in Washington.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

It allows a company to go public without all the paperwork of a traditional initial public offering. Above, the Charging Bull statue in New York City\\'s Financial District.\\nThis year, the hottest trend on Wall Street could be summed up in one strange and unfamiliar word: SPAC.\\nShaquille O\\'Neal\\'s got a SPAC. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan\\'s got a SPAC. Famed investor Bill Ackman launched a $4 billion SPAC. And a 25-year-old became the youngest self-made billionaire thanks to — you guessed it — a SPAC.\\nSo what is a SPAC? A \"special purpose acquisition company\" is a way for a company to go public without all the paperwork of a traditional IPO, or initial public offering.\\nIn an IPO, a company announces it wants to go public, then discloses a lot of details about its business operations. After that, investors put money into the company in exchange for shares.\\nA SPAC flips that process around. Investors pool their money together first, with no idea what company they\\'re investing in. The SPAC goes public as a shell company. The required disclosures are easier than those for a regular IPO, because a pile of money doesn\\'t have any business operations to describe.\\nThen, generally, the SPAC goes out and looks for a real company that wants to go public, and they merge together. The company gets the stock ticker and the pile of money much more quickly than through a normal IPO.\\nThe investors now own stock in a real company, not just a shell company. And the sponsor who put the work into organizing the SPAC gets a big chunk of the company as a reward.\\nFor the last two decades, SPACs have existed on the fringes of the financial world.\\n\"They have this sort of shady origin story,\" says Usha Rodrigues, a professor at the University of Georgia School of Law.\\nToday\\'s SPACs are descended from the \"blank-check corporations\" of the 1980s, which \"really had a bad reputation,\" Rodrigues says.\\nThey were so infamous for scamming investors that a federal law was passed to crack down on them.\\nAlong the way, the blank-check model was reinvented as a SPAC, with crucial safeguards for investors. For instance, if an investor didn\\'t approve of the company a SPAC sponsor chose to merge with, the investor could get his or her money back, plus interest.\\nBut SPACs remained unpopular. Until now.\\n Loading... \\nIPOs, mergers and acquisitions, and deal-making in general are all up sharply right now — no wonder, as the stock market is currently booming.\\nBut SPACs, specifically, are surging like nothing else. SPAC launches have quadrupled since last year, and an astonishing number of SPAC combinations (the transactions that actually take a company public) have been announced.\\n\"I\\'ve probably done, you know, one or two SPAC combinations a year for the last five years — until this year,\" says Sarah Morgan, a lawyer with the large energy-focused law firm Vinson & Elkins. \"This year the market just exploded. [SPACs] are over 50% of my practice this year.\"\\nSPACs are sparking new attention in part because their built-in advantages — speed, control and less uncertainty for founders who want to go public — are particularly appealing in a year marked by volatility.\\nAustin Russell is the CEO of Luminar, a company that makes lidar — technology that detects surrounding objects, sort of like radar but using lasers — for self-driving vehicles.\\nHe founded the company as a teenager, and now Luminar has contracts with companies like Volvo.\\nIt was time to go public. Russell said that \"mechanically and financially,\" a SPAC just made sense — and you can\\'t argue with the speed.\\n\"You got through the process end to end in, you know, like four months, as opposed to having to spend huge time and distraction for the better part of a year or two,\" he says.\\nBut Russell didn\\'t agree to a SPAC until he\\'d seen several other \"very legitimate\" companies go public through the process.\\nThat\\'s another key element in the meteoric rise of SPACs: After high-profile, well-regarded companies and investors started getting involved in SPACs, other people were more willing to give it a shot.\\nAs Russell put it, a SPAC is now \"pretty cool.\"\\nRussell completed his company\\'s SPAC merger this month — a transaction that made him Forbes\\' youngest self-made billionaire.\\nSPACS can also mean big bucks for the sponsors who organize them, who are rewarded with a big chunk of equity when they close a deal. In fact, sponsors can make so much money if they complete a SPAC that some critics worry there\\'s an incentive to merge with a mediocre company just to get their payday.\\nAnd that raises a big question: whether this SPAC craze will be good for investors. The stock market is booming now, and SPACs are a boom within a boom, but will that actually lead to returns?\\nSome of this year\\'s SPACs have performed badly on the stock market, and others have raised bigger concerns.\\nAfter zero-emission truck-maker Nikola went public through a SPAC, it was accused of fraud, which the company denies.\\nToday\\'s SPACs are much safer investments than the fraudulent blank-check companies of the \\'80s, says Rodrigues, but the same streamlined, speedy process that appeals to founders could increase the perils for investors.\\n\"The flip side of making things easier for companies is inevitably that the risk of fraud to investors goes up,\" she says. \"I don\\'t know any way to square that circle.\"\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

Opposition has come from Hollywood stars, state attorneys general and local residents who worry about the danger this poses.  But plans are moving ahead for a New Jersey project that calls for one of the longest such transport routes in the country: 200 miles through densely populated areas of the East Coast. \\nThe gas from Pennsylvania\\'s Marcellus Shale would first be sent by pipeline to a new liquefaction plant in the rural northeast part of the state. Refrigeration units would chill it to negative-260 degrees Fahrenheit, at which point it becomes liquid and easier to ship. The part of the plan that scares a lot of people is the next step — transporting the gas by truck or rail down the busy I-95 corridor to a planned export terminal along the Delaware River in Gloucester County, New Jersey.\\n\"That terrifies me,\" says Vanessa Keegan, who lives nearby with her family, including her three-year-old son Theo.  She points to where rail cars full of highly flammable liquefied natural gas — or LNG — would roll about a block and a half away from her house. \"That train track that you could skip on down to in about a minute and a half.\"\\nA daycare center sits right next to the gate of the planned export terminal. \\nPipelines are the more common way to move gas long distances, but battles over them have delayed or even scrapped some projects. Trucks are also allowed to transport LNG. But using rail cars in densely populated areas had been limited until the new rule took effect in August. \\nEven before that, Delaware River Partners, a subsidiary of New Fortress Energy, which has ties to President Trump, secured a special federal permit to move the LNG by rail. It allows two 100-car trains to transport the gas each day. \\n\\n                Homes next to train tracks in Gibbstown, NJ, where up to 200 rail cars a day will be allowed to carry liquefied natural gas to an export terminal.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Emma Lee/WHYY\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nHomes next to train tracks in Gibbstown, NJ, where up to 200 rail cars a day will be allowed to carry liquefied natural gas to an export terminal.\\nIn this rust-belt region of New Jersey the project does have support, including from building trade unions and powerful state lawmakers. State Assemblyman John Burzichelli says his grandfather worked at a shuttered DuPont dynamite plant that will house the planned LNG export terminal. \\n\"That site will create jobs as it once did, contribute to the tax base as it once did, and be an important economic driver for people to make a living and feed their families,\" says Burzichelli.\\nHe says safety issues should be addressed, but that rail cars carry much more hazardous materials through the region every day.  \"The history of moving this stuff is pretty sound,\" he says.\\nThe new rule does require rail cars to be built with a thicker outer tank than is mandated for other hazardous cryogenic liquids like ethylene and ethane. (Although it\\'s unclear if that applies to projects like this one, greenlighted earlier through a special permit.)\\nRay Mentzer, a chemical engineer at Purdue University, spent his career working on LNG projects for Exxon Mobil. He says the specially designed containers that transport hydrocarbons have a good safety record. But he says transporting the gas through densely populated areas increases the risk if there\\'s a leak.\\n\"It\\'s not flammable until it\\'s vaporized, but it\\'s going to be vaporized pretty darn quickly and then it\\'s going to seek an ignition source,\" he says. \"Believe me, it will find an ignition source pretty darn readily.\"\\nThe developers of the New Jersey export project — New Fortress Energy and Delaware River Partners — did not respond to multiple requests for an interview, and would not confirm details of their plans.\\nRail companies lobbied for the rule and downplay the potential for accidents. \\nEarlier this year, Ian Jefferies, CEO of the Association of American Railroads, told NPR \"the track record speaks for itself: 99.99% of all hazmat moved by rail reaches its destination without any incident whatsoever.\" He also said industry uses \"risk-based routing analysis to ensure that railroads are using the lowest risk routes.\"\\nFifteen state Attorneys General, including those in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware, have challenged the move saying it put people\\'s lives at risk. \\n\"We\\'re going to court because our families expect our government to put their safety first, not put them in harm\\'s way,\" said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra in a statement. Becerra is now president-elect Joe Biden\\'s nominee for Health and Human Services Secretary.\\nDespite joining that suit, New Jersey recently signed off on construction of a dock for the LNG export project, although N.J. Governor Phil Murphy says the state \"will explore all avenues within its authority to prevent the use of this dock for LNG transport.\"\\nThe Delaware Riverkeeper Network has challenged a number of state and federal permits for the project, saying a thorough Environmental Impact Statement was never done. \\n\"The Biden Administration could step in and set a policy that this project, and all other LNG export projects, require comprehensive environmental review,\" says the network\\'s deputy director Tracy Carluccio.\\nStanding on her porch along the route to the planned export terminal, Vanessa Keegan worries that transporting LNG by rail is untested. \"If an accident happens,\" she says, \"we don\\'t get to show up the next day and say, \\'Look, I told you so.\\'\"\\nShe also thinks fossil fuel projects like this should be abandoned in favor of renewables like wind or solar. \\nIn fact, if the export facility gets built, none of the gas traveling through the area will go to power New Jersey homes. The state is planning a large offshore wind farm to help reach its goal of using all clean energy by 2050. \\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

Mann was one of the residents who died of COVID-19 this year when there was an outbreak at the facility.\\nOn the evening of Feb. 20 at an assisted living facility just on the edge of southwest Atlanta, Ernestine Mann stood in front of her peers to read aloud a proclamation commemorating Black History Month. She was dressed for the occasion: delicate earrings and a flowy blouse with a little hint of shimmer.\\n\"Good evening everyone,\" Mann said as her daughter Karla McKinney filmed. \"This is my first year living here, and I\\'m having a great time.\"\\nMann moved into this facility, Arbor Terrace at Cascade, in August 2019 and quickly became a prominent community member. She was a leader in a group tasked with welcoming newcomers; once, she\\'d greeted a woman who was deaf by seamlessly switching to American Sign Language, a skill she\\'d learned years earlier. \\n\"She was not over there wasting away,\" McKinney said. \"She wasn\\'t the resident that just kind of showed up for the dining hall and then just stayed in her room. She had a really nice social life.\"\\nThat particular night in February, Mann was standing before her new neighbors, reading a document celebrating \"the remarkable accomplishments and lasting impact of our country\\'s great African American leaders and citizens.\" \\nIt was fitting she would read this particular proclamation to this particular group. Many of the residents fit that description. There was Bernice Foster, known for her musical talent; Dr. Delutha King, co-founder of the Sickle Cell Foundation of Georgia, and his wife, Lois King; Blanche and Eddie Johnson Jr., married for 63 years; Edgar Lewis, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel; and, of course, Mann herself, a teacher for three decades.\\nIn a little more than two months, all of them would die from COVID-19. \\n\\n                Siblings Karla McKinney and Bill Mann last saw their mother, Ernestine Mann, alive on March 25 through a window visit after the facility started restricting visitors.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Lynsey Weatherspoon for NPR\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nSiblings Karla McKinney and Bill Mann last saw their mother, Ernestine Mann, alive on March 25 through a window visit after the facility started restricting visitors.\\nIn all, at least 17 residents died, 54 residents tested positive, and 36 staff tested positive. It is the worst outbreak among the 11 Georgia locations managed by the Arbor Co. There\\'s another key difference between this Arbor Terrace and the others: In Georgia, it is the company\\'s only facility in a predominantly Black neighborhood. That has left the families of the dead to wonder what exactly went wrong and whether racism played a role.\\nNPR looked into what happened at Arbor Terrace at Cascade to try to answer that question. Through government records and interviews with families, residents, and former staff, a more complete picture of the outbreak emerged. The Arbor Co. left Cascade residents and staff inadequately protected at a crucial moment, and this particular facility could not afford missteps. Systemic factors — including its location in Atlanta and its particularly vulnerable population — made this place both more susceptible and more vulnerable to the virus and, perhaps, its staff less equipped to respond.\\nThe result reflects a grim national pattern that has endured throughout the pandemic\\'s many months: Black Americans are getting and dying from COVID-19 at higher rates than white Americans. The outbreak at Arbor Terrace at Cascade offers a glimpse into factors that contribute to that disparity at a place where some of the families did not expect it to play out. \\n\"Even though you achieved all these things, at the end of your life, you are in essence, and I hate to say this, you were in some COVID-infested center,\" said Tricia Johnson, the daughter of a resident who tested positive but survived. \"I mean, their brand has definitely been tarnished, but it doesn\\'t appear it\\'s going to be tarnished in the white areas.\"\\n\"The crème de la crème\"\\nArbor Terrace at Cascade is just off Cascade Road, a major thoroughfare in southwest Atlanta. A tall grove of trees shields the building from the main road, making it feel apart from the bustle of the nearby Home Depot and Walmart. Its colonial revival facade is homey: red brick and pale yellow siding with slate-colored shutters.\\nThe area around the facility is simply known as Cascade, and the neighborhood has had its share of notable residents over the years: former Atlanta mayors, baseball legend Hank Aaron and John Lewis, the late civil rights leader and congressman. But until the mid-1960s, much of the area was white.\\n\\n                Cascade is a predominantly Black middle-class neighborhood of Atlanta. The area has been home to some notable people, including the late Rep. John Lewis and Hank Aaron.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Lynsey Weatherspoon for NPR\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nCascade is a predominantly Black middle-class neighborhood of Atlanta. The area has been home to some notable people, including the late Rep. John Lewis and Hank Aaron.\\n\"It was one of those white flight things where the Blacks were moving into the area more and more,\" said the Rev. Gary Dean, senior pastor at Hoosier Memorial United Methodist Church, located near Cascade Road. \"Of course the whites, they left, and the community became basically all Black.\"\\nAfter Arbor Terrace at Cascade opened in 1999, it came to mirror its surroundings. The Black movers and shakers of Atlanta moved in. Talk to people who have worked there, and they\\'ll tell you stories of doctors, lawyers, teachers, city planners, a Tuskegee Airman. Marcus Davis, a former maintenance director at the facility, said living in the Cascade area was a \"badge of honor\" and that Arbor Terrace at Cascade, where it was common to pay more than $4,000 per month for an apartment, became a \"status symbol.\"\\n\"It was like being at grandma and grandpa\\'s house every day. You had some of the most intelligent, sweet, kind, loving people,\" Davis said. \"A lot of the people who resided at Arbor Terrace at Cascade were intricate parts of Black history throughout Atlanta and throughout the United States.\"\\nWhen the National Center for Civil and Human Rights opened in Atlanta in 2014, Davis said they took a group from the facility to the museum. He listened to the residents swap stories from the civil rights movement.\\n\"They were firsthand accounts,\" he said. \"Oh my God, it was unbelievable.\"\\nWhen Mann\\'s family was searching for a facility, her daughter Karla McKinney said they landed on Arbor Terrace in part because it was near where her mother had lived, and because she already had friends there. \\n\"It was looked upon as one of the crème de la crème of assisted living facilities,\" McKinney said.\\n\\'\\'If I knew what I know now, I could have just lost my job\"\\nIn the weeks leading up to the first highly publicized outbreaks in the U.S., Jazmine Heggins, a former resident assistant who worked at the facility at the time, remembers feeling like some employees weren\\'t as worried as they should have been.\\n\"It kind of was like, \\'Oh, that\\'s not going to make it to the United States. We\\'re not going to have anything to worry about.\\' It was kind of just like something that was made up almost,\" she said. \\n\\n                Arbor Terrace at Cascade is the Arbor Co.\\'s only facility in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Georgia.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Lynsey Weatherspoon for NPR\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nArbor Terrace at Cascade is the Arbor Co.\\'s only facility in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Georgia.\\nBut then, Heggins said, staff and residents started to get sick with something. And by late March, she did, too.\\nShe woke up exhausted on a Friday morning. By Sunday, she had aches and a sore throat. She later wrote on her blog that \"it was as if someone had beaten me with a baseball bat overnight.\"\\nHeggins told NPR that she reached out to work, saying she thought she had caught something from the residents. The staff member who replied said she couldn\\'t call in sick and should tough it out.\\nHeggins said she felt confused: The company had explicitly told them not to come into work if they felt sick. That was in line with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance. But now she was being told to come in. \\n\"It was like they were telling us one thing, but then they really meant, like, it doesn\\'t actually matter. We just have to tell you this,\" Heggins told NPR. A few hours after she got to work, she said she developed a fever. At that point, she said, she was allowed to go home.\\nWhile Heggins was out, she said she started getting phone calls from coworkers, telling her about the residents who died.\\n\"It was like someone calling you and telling you, \\'Hey, your grandma just passed away, and you may have given them COVID and they just passed away,\\' but it was over and over again,\" Heggins said. \"Everybody that you take care of every day, say good night to and tuck in to sleep and wake them up in the morning, they\\'re dead now.\"\\nShe said she eventually asked them to stop calling. \\n\"I was going to sleep crying every night. It was just too much,\" she said. \"I was potentially going to lose my job, but if I knew what I know now, I could have just lost my job.\"\\nAnother former staff member, who asked not to be named, said other coworkers also felt pressured to come to work and that leadership at the facility told them they couldn\\'t go home if they didn\\'t have a fever, even if they were showing other symptoms.\\n\"Just as simple as that,\" the staff member said. \"Most likely you\\'re getting fired.\"\\nThat person also remembers working while symptomatic. One day sticks out in particular, when six or seven residents fell ill at the same time. \\n\"They were throwing up. They were extremely weak. They were having diarrhea. People were clammy and we\\'re trying to get them going to the hospital,\" the staff member said. \"I just remember sitting down telling my other coworker, \\'I can\\'t make it through the day.\\' I said, \\'Something\\'s wrong with me and I\\'m not feeling well.\\' My whole body was aching and it\\'s all of my strength just to make it through that day.\"\\nIn a statement to NPR, Judd Harper, president of the Arbor Co., said: \"Before the pandemic, Arbor Terrace at Cascade had policies, practices, and procedures, which instructed staff not to come to work with illnesses or physical conditions that may pose a risk to their or others\\' health and safety. During the pandemic, we re-emphasized that policy and reminded staff of the policy in daily huddles starting on March 3, 2020.\"\\nAccording to Harper, Arbor Terrace at Cascade also took the staff\\'s temperature and had them change clothes when coming to work, and tracked the symptoms of staff who were sick. Harper also told NPR the company paid for coronavirus testing for staff, increased their paid time off, provided hourly bonuses to healthy employees, and provided financial assistance for child care, among other initiatives. \\n\\'\\'She didn\\'t have to go this way\\'\\'\\nMarch 25 was the last day McKinney and Bill Mann saw their mother alive. Arbor Terrace at Cascade began restricting visitors on March 12, but by the end of the month, they were allowing window visits. The family came wearing masks and gloves.\\n\"As we were watching and waiting for my mom to come to the window, we could see her coming across the lobby and she was toddling like a baby just beginning to walk,\" McKinney said. The family knew then that something was off, McKinney said, but tried to stay cheerful. \\n\"She was able to talk but, see, if you knew her, [when] my mom spoke, she spoke strong,\" Bill Mann said. \"This particular time she sounded extremely weak. It was almost to a whisper, and that\\'s just not like her.\"\\nTheir mom seemed dazed. Her eyes were darting around as if she just couldn\\'t fix her gaze on anyone. She had trouble recognizing her granddaughter. \\n\"We ended up not staying as long as we thought we might have because she clearly was tired and something wasn\\'t right,\" McKinney said. \"When we did get ready to go, she stood up and she stumbled.\"\\n\\n                Marian Hatch, a former resident at Arbor Terrace at Cascade, looks at one of the photos of her friends.

And the staff agreed that something was wrong. Mann had been having bouts of diarrhea. They called an ambulance. Marian Hatch, one of Mann\\'s closest friends at the facility, watched as her friend was taken away.\\n\"I saw her. I think I knew she was sick,\" Hatch, who is 92 and tested positive but survived, told NPR. \"The very last time that I saw Ernestine, when she was on the gurney, when she was in the hall waiting to be carried away, I didn\\'t go over to her. I waved at her.\"\\nAt Piedmont Atlanta Hospital, Mann was first diagnosed with pneumonia. \\n\"Once she got to the hospital, you know, we\\'re blowing up the hospital [with calls] trying to find out what is going on,\" Bill Mann said.\\nHer coronavirus test came back positive on March 27. She was placed on oxygen. On March 28, she seemed to be doing better. But by the next day, she had taken a turn for the worst. That morning, a doctor called, saying Mann was agitated and pulling at her oxygen mask. The hospital staff wanted to see if the family could calm her down over the phone.\\n\"I still try very hard to get the sound of her voice out of my mind, even to this day. She said, \\'Come help me, help me, help me, you all, please come help me,\\' \" McKinney remembered. The family couldn\\'t visit, because of COVID-19 restrictions. \\n\"To hear her crying out for help, to know that I couldn\\'t get there, it\\'s just been very emotional for me to have that memory of her,\" McKinney said. \"And now, learning more about COVID victims, they seem to feel like they\\'re drowning. That\\'s what I\\'m told. And just having that thought that my mom was in that predicament, it\\'s just really hard.\"\\nBill Mann remembers praying with his mom. Afterward, he said she seemed more at peace. \"After the prayer she said, \\'Thank you so much, I really needed that,\\' \" he recalled.\\nA doctor called again later that day, asking about end-of-life decisions, and whether or not they would want to resuscitate.\\n\\n                McKinney last saw her mother alive on March 25. She noticed something was off when her mom appeared dazed and unable to focus when the family visited through a window.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Lynsey Weatherspoon for NPR\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\n\"I just didn\\'t see it coming,\" McKinney said. \"I just didn\\'t understand why those kinds of questions were being asked.\"\\nLater on, another call: Their mom had stopped breathing on her own.\\n\"The doctor described what it would be like to be on a ventilator, and it was pretty much to prolong the inevitable, and she would suffer,\" McKinney remembers. \"We had to make that heartbreaking decision to let her go.\"\\nErnestine Mann died in the afternoon on March 29. She was 84.\\n\"I understand we are all on the clock and sooner or later we have to go, but not like that,\" Bill Mann said. \"She didn\\'t have to go this way.\"\\nErnestine Mann\\'s death was at the start of a wave of others at the facility. Nancy Finney died the next day. On April 3, Dr. Delutha King and Bernice Foster both died. King had been sent back and forth between different hospitals and the facility at least twice before he died, according to his son Ron Loving. \\nHattie Jay died April 5. She had tested negative for the virus, but her daughter Perdita Fisher believes she died because of the stress of isolation. Eddie Johnson Jr. died April 5 and his wife, Blanche, three days later. A photograph of them holding hands at the hospital went viral. \\nCatherine Hendrix died April 6. Her son Cedric said he still sometimes drives by the facility, wondering what went wrong. Four day later, Lois King, Delutha\\'s wife, died on the day her husband was buried. Dorothy McGirt and Gloria Bolds both died April 12. JoeAnn Snead had only lived at the facility for a little more than two weeks before she was sent to the hospital, where she spent about a month before she died on April 21. A week and a half after that, on May 2, Edgar Lewis died. \\nAt least 17 were dead of COVID-19 by the end, though state records differ on whether the final death toll was 17 or 19. NPR was able to confirm the names of these 13 through family interviews, news reports and obituaries. And somewhere among all those deaths, there were at least four others whose names we couldn\\'t find at all.\\n\"We weren\\'t just going to leave them by themselves\"\\nFour families, including Mann\\'s, have ongoing lawsuits against the Arbor Co.

Harper said that on Feb. 29, the company implemented additional safeguards, and it kept adding more protections throughout March and April, some even before the CDC or the state recommended them. Each community was responsible for implementing the plan, according to a record from the Georgia Department of Community Health.\\nSome of the outbreak at Arbor Terrace at Cascade, which happened so early in the U.S. experience of the pandemic, can be attributed to bad luck. But there were other factors that made this place vulnerable. \\nBy early March, employees at Arbor Terrace at Cascade told NPR they were beginning to feel nervous that they did not have enough personal protective equipment for themselves or the residents.\\n\"That\\'s when we really started to ask questions, because we\\'re like, OK, COVID-19 is real,\" said Heggins, the resident assistant who worked there at the time. \"We were asking our staff, like, \\'Hey, are there going to be any masks? Are there going to be more gloves? Will we have this protection? Because these are things that they\\'re saying that we need.\\' \"\\nThe CDC had recommended nearly a month earlier that caregivers working with someone they suspected of having the virus should wear PPE or a face mask. But PPE shortages were rampant across the country, and, documents show, Arbor Terrace at Cascade was no different. \\nIn a statement to NPR, Harper acknowledged the difficulties in getting PPE: \"Although maintaining adequate PPE was challenging, Arbor Terrace at Cascade never ran out of PPE.\"\\nHe told NPR that on March 2, the facility began \"taking steps to secure PPE beyond the PPE already available at the community. This included purchases from PPE distributors, donations from businesses in the community, and requests to government entities.\"\\n\\n                Georgia state records from March 27, when the outbreak at Arbor Terrace at Cascade had already begun, say the facility needed more personal protective equipment.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Photo illustration by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nGeorgia state records from March 27, when the outbreak at Arbor Terrace at Cascade had already begun, say the facility needed more personal protective equipment.\\nAccording to records from the Georgia Department of Public Health, eight of the 11 Arbor Co. locations in Georgia requested hundreds of N95 respirators, surgical masks, face shields, gowns and gloves between March 13 and 31. None of these orders ended up being fulfilled. A spokesperson for the department told NPR it needed to \"prioritize the needs of acute care hospitals.\" Arbor Terrace at Cascade was one of the three that didn\\'t request any personal protective equipment from the public health department during that two-week time period, although it may have requested PPE from other sources.\\n\"Thankfully, Arbor Terrace had a sufficient supply of PPE prior to and at the start of the novel COVID-19 virus pandemic,\" Harper wrote. \\nBut on March 27, the day after the first case at the facility was officially reported to the state, the Georgia Department of Public Health reviewed the facility\\'s COVID-19 procedures via a video call. According to an infection prevention assessment obtained by NPR from that review, the department indicated that the facility \"has limited masks,\" and \"needs more PPE\" for staff to wear consistently when a resident was showing COVID-19 symptoms and when helping residents to perform \"high contact activities\" such as bathing and dressing. According to the document, the facility reported having staffing issues. By then, the record shows, 15 staff members were showing symptoms of an \"ILI,\" or influenza-like illness.\\n\"There were a lot of times where we would have to go in the rooms without wearing PPE equipment,\" the staff member who asked not to be named told NPR. \"At the end of the day, we weren\\'t just going to leave them by themselves. We still had to take care of them.\"\\nThat\\'s not what the Arbor Co. was telling families at the time. \\nOn March 26, Harper sent an email to Cascade families, telling them that a resident had tested positive for the coronavirus. He assured families that \"all staff members will wear masks and gloves when interacting with all residents.\" \\nThe next day, the day that the public health department indicated the company \"needs more PPE,\" Harper sent another email: \"We have reviewed our processes and procedures with the Georgia Department of Public Health and they have assured us that we are doing what we should be doing in this situation.\"\\nThe company did keep taking measures to stop the spread of the virus. A disinfecting company conducted a full decontamination of the building on March 27, the day after the first confirmed case. On April 3 and 16, the Georgia National Guard also conducted decontaminations of the facility. \\nBut by then, it was too late.\\n\\'\\'That difference can mean life or death\\'\\'\\nNot only did the company\\'s missteps at Arbor Terrace at Cascade leave it susceptible to an outbreak, but more systemic factors, such as the facility\\'s population and its location in Atlanta, meant those missteps ultimately proved disastrous. \\nAssisted living facilities, which are home to about 800,000 mostly older Americans, are especially vulnerable to infectious diseases: You\\'ve got a vulnerable population living together with workers coming in and out. Today, nearly 40% of all the U.S. COVID-19 deaths have happened at long-term care facilities such as assisted living facilities, retirement communities and nursing homes.\\nArbor Terrace at Cascade was no different. But once the virus was inside the facility, it might have hit those residents harder. African Americans have higher rates of diabetes and high blood pressure, and higher death rates from heart disease. Health disparities such as these have been attributed to systemic racism, and those particular conditions also put individuals at higher risk for severe complications from COVID-19.\\n\\n                A view of an empty John Lewis Freedom Parkway against the backdrop of downtown Atlanta on April 4.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Kevin C.

One June study found COVID-19 cases in nursing homes across the country are more related to location rather than whether the facility had a poor rating or past infection control violations. Indeed, Arbor Terrace at Cascade had fewer violations per routine inspection than most of the other company locations, according to a database created by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\\nMost of Atlanta is part of Fulton County. That county has about 10% of Georgia\\'s population, but by March 21, it had nearly 20% of the confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state. And within Fulton County, the area near Arbor Terrace at Cascade in southwest Atlanta was hit harder still in the pandemic\\'s early weeks. \\nThere are many reasons why one area might have more COVID-19 cases than another: more people living in crowded housing, using public transportation or who are unable to work from home, among others. Some of those factors are related to poverty, which disproportionately affects people of color. But a New York University study in July of 10 major U.S. metro areas, including Atlanta, found that racial disparities in COVID-19 infections existed beyond disparities related to income.\\n\"When we looked at the early phase of the pandemic within urban U.S. areas, we did not see income explaining away all of the racial and ethnic disparities in COVID outcomes,\" says Sam Adhikari, who led the NYU study and is an assistant professor of biostatistics at NYU\\'s School of Medicine. \"There are other structural systems and historical context that might be putting them at higher risk.\"\\nEven a middle-class neighborhood such as Cascade has subtle signs of systemic disinvestment if you look closely. Take home values: Though the median household income of that area is similar to that of Atlanta, the median home value around Cascade is around $120,000 less than Atlanta\\'s median home value.\\nNationwide, homes in predominantly Black neighborhoods are worth 23% less than homes in neighborhoods with few or no Black residents, according to research led by Andre Perry, a fellow at the Brookings Institution. The value of your home can help determine the services and resources allocated to your community. It\\'s also a key way to build wealth.\\n\\n                Signs of disinvestment are visible even in middle-class neighborhoods such as Cascade.

And we know that wealth is a protector of sorts, that when we have these economic or health crises, wealth enables us to shelter more,\" Perry says. \"Racism transcends class. Middle-class Black neighborhoods are treated differently than middle-class white neighborhoods. And that difference can mean life or death.\"\\n\\'\\'Can you imagine what happens when a pandemic hits?\\'\\'\\nIn an email to Cascade families on April 17, Harper wrote: \"Many of you have asked why Arbor Terrace Cascade experienced these results. We wish we could tell you. Our protocols and processes are exactly the same in all of our senior living communities.\"\\nNPR could not confirm whether the company\\'s protocols, pandemic-related or otherwise, were indeed the same across all its communities, but former Cascade staff members told NPR that Arbor Terrace at Cascade was simply not as nice as the other Arbor Co. locations.\\nPart of that stems from the age of the community: Most of the other Arbor Co. locations in Georgia were opened or renovated more than a decade after Arbor Terrace at Cascade first opened.\\n\"The building is 20 years old. So how do you compare that to a 6-year-old building?\" a former wellness director at the facility, who asked not to be named, told NPR. \"Everything about the experience is going to be different.\"\\nThat staff member added that they believed the company\\'s standards were still the same. But other former staff members disagreed.\\n\"We wouldn\\'t get new stuff. We would get gently used or something that another site didn\\'t want,\" said Davis, the former maintenance director. \"We had to fight for everything we got.

The company confirmed to NPR that a new van was purchased for the facility in 2016. \\n\"All of a sudden because he\\'s embarrassed now, he was forced to go and get it done. So they did give us money,\" Davis said. \"You can imagine if we\\'re coming to that event ... how bad it had to look.\"\\nDavis recalled another incident, when the remnants of Hurricane Irma hit in September 2017. \\n\"I remember it like yesterday. The hurricane was coming. We\\'d been asking for generators for years. We need generators. We need generators. And they\\'d never approve that,\" Davis said.\\nCascade\\'s power went out for two days, Davis said. Once the sun went down, he said staff put glow sticks around the residents\\' necks. Eventually, he said the corporate office brought them gas-powered generators to string up some lights. \\n\"The other Arbor Terraces, they already had generators and they were fully functional and there were no issues,\" Davis said. \\nThe company confirmed that it has purchased portable generators during storm-related power outages but did not confirm that the other Georgia locations had generators before Arbor Terrace at Cascade. \\n\"The only reason we were not prepared is because we didn\\'t have the funding to be prepared,\" Davis said. \"But as a company, your job is to see where something has a deficit and try to help them navigate through that and not just say, \\'Well, you just can\\'t afford it because you don\\'t have enough revenue coming in.\\' \"\\nIn his statement to NPR, Harper did not acknowledge any differences in budgets between the locations but did confirm that each community has its own budget and \"funds are not commingled with other Arbor communities.\"\\nOf course, any budget differences that did exist between the facilities wouldn\\'t necessarily add up to a higher likelihood of a virus outbreak.\\n\"But if you\\'re always shortchanging something, if you\\'re always the last to be part of something, you can\\'t help but to fail,\" Davis said. \"Can you imagine what happens when a pandemic hits? You get the response that you have.\"\\nIn his statement to NPR, Harper wrote: \"In 1999, we opened Arbor Terrace at Cascade as a state-of-the-art community. We maintain the campus with vigor. ...

The emotional toil of adapting to new dynamics with patients and families at one rural hospital in Livingston, Mont., is a case study of what health care workers are grappling with all over the country.\\nFramed by the rugged Absaroka Mountains in south-central Montana, Livingston HealthCare looks more like an upscale ski chalet than a medical facility. It\\'s one of more than 1,300 critical access hospitals in the U.S., which are federally designated to increase health care access in rural areas.

This is the epicenter of the pandemic in the hospital — where the worst cases are. The beds are empty and neatly made. Soft, yellow light is pouring in from outside. But a few weeks ago, the scene here would have looked very different. Over the past several months, cases in the area ebbed and flowed — and they were in the midst of the biggest spike they\\'d seen so far.\\n\"My job consisted of 24/7 begging people to try to come in to get help, coming in to try to staff it myself, just because we didn\\'t have enough nurses,\" Schmid says.\\nThe CDC recommends that hospitals limit visitation, especially during times of community spread. Figuring out how to do so requires balancing safety with the emotion and trauma faced by patients and their families.\\nHere, the hospital banned visitors, but there are exceptions. When patients near the end of their lives, their closest relatives are allowed to say their goodbyes from a distance — through those windows that look into the ICU. Schmid sat outside the room with families. She says that glass barrier between patients and their loved ones made farewells an even more emotionally devastating experience.\\n\"Having to sit out here with family and try to be their support and give them that affection or that caring when you yourself have to stay 6 feet away and they can\\'t see their dad or their husband for the last time and you have to watch that, it\\'s gut-wrenching,\" she says. \"And I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever get used to that.

Instead of smiles and facial expressions, only their eyes — perched above an N95 — can show emotion and establish connection.\\n\"It makes me sick to my stomach thinking about that, like, so many people are dying alone and their nurse has maybe known \\'em or a couple of days is the last person they see,\" medical floor nurse Kristy Blaine says.\\nShe says she recognizes the emotional work it takes to keep patients feeling connected.\\n\\n                Travel nurse Michael Niynaku, tasked with treating COVID-19 patients for the day, at a nurses\\' station in front of baggies containing staff members\\' N95 masks.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Nick Mott for NPR\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nTravel nurse Michael Niynaku, tasked with treating COVID-19 patients for the day, at a nurses\\' station in front of baggies containing staff members\\' N95 masks.\\n\"You also, you know, feel bad for your patients because these Martians are coming in, looking so different,\" Blaine says. \"You know, you literally look like an alien and you\\'re trying to care for your patients, and they just feel like lepers.\"\\nBlaine does what she can to make the hospital feel less sterile for her patients.

With only eyes peering out behind a mask, that pooping unicorn is one way of bringing joy into a world of isolation.\\nLimits on visitations in hospitals across the country are unlikely to change much until this spring or summer, when vaccines are widely available. Until then, health care workers will continue to adapt, to innovate, and to find reasons to smile.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

He did it early and deposited his mail-in ballot in one of many drop boxes provided by his local election office in Miami-Dade County.\\n\"So early voting, drop box. Checked the supervisor of elections website a couple of days later and it was tabulated,\" he said. \"It worked swell.\"\\nThat was a relief for Nielsen, whose vote did not count in 2018. His ballot arrived too late, despite being mailed more than a week before Election Day. \\nNPR reported earlier this year that more than a half-million mail-in votes were rejected in the 2020 primaries for similar reasons. The ballots arrived too late or had missing or mismatched signatures.  \\nAnd with many more people voting by mail this fall, election officials feared that millions more ballots would be rejected in the general election.\\nIt didn\\'t happen. Instead, rejection rates went down across the country, in states such as North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio and Florida — although final numbers are still coming in.\\nDaniel Smith, a political scientist at the University of Florida, says that out of almost 5 million mail-in ballots cast in his state this fall, fewer than 9,000 were rejected, a much lower rate than in previous elections. \\nHe said it wasn\\'t because voters made fewer mistakes. \\n\"The rates of ballots being flagged for problems wasn\\'t any lower than in past elections. It\\'s just that individuals were able to cure their ballots in a timely fashion to make sure that their ballots would count,\" said Smith.\\nFixes and cures\\nAs in many other states, Florida made it easier this year for voters to fix, or \"cure,\" their ballots. For example, Florida\\'s mail-in ballot envelopes included space where voters could provide their email address or phone number, allowing election officials to contact them more quickly about mistakes, so they could be fixed on time. \\nThat change also provided crucial contact information for campaigns and interest groups, so they too could reach out to voters to make sure that their ballots counted. And indeed, many groups did just that, helping their supporters cure their ballots as part of aggressive get-out-the-vote campaigns. \\nJared Dearing, executive director of Kentucky\\'s board of elections, says his state also took steps to help absentee voters after more than 25,000 ballots were rejected in the June primary. Prior to the pandemic, only about 2% of Kentucky voters cast their ballots by mail, compared with 75% this year. There were some growing pains.\\n\"So what we tried to do is create 1) uniformity of process and 2) to give some pretty clear guidelines to the counties of what could be counted, what couldn\\'t be counted,\" said Dearing.\\nHe said some counties were discarding ballots for reasons that others did not, such as a voter signing the envelope in the wrong place. Under the new guidelines, such ballots would be accepted.\\nThe state also created an online portal where voters were able to apply for an absentee ballot, track its progress and be alerted of potential problems. That helped cut rejections dramatically, to about 2,500 votes in November. \\n\"Not waiting until the last day\"\\nDearing said something else added to the decline. He saw a monumental shift in voter behavior this year, as though all those warnings and news stories about tossed ballots and postal delays really sunk in. \\n\"For the first time, voters were not waiting until the last day to mail these things. They were all mailing them weeks ahead of time,\" he said.\\nAmber McReynolds, CEO of the National Vote at Home Institute and a former Colorado election official, saw another silver lining. She said the fact that so many ballots were rejected in the primaries helped voters learn how to do it right. Many of them were first-time absentee voters, in large part because of the pandemic. \\n\"It\\'s a teachable moment, right,\" she said. \"You get your ballot rejected, then you\\'re probably not going to make that mistake again.\"\\nIronically, some election officials think President Trump\\'s repeated attacks on mail-in voting as insecure also helped, by keeping the issue front and center. Voters heard over and over again how important it was to follow the rules.\\nMcReynolds hopes that states learn from this year\\'s experiences and find ways to make mail voting easier and more problem-free.  She said there were many good examples of states educating their voters about the process and potential pitfalls. Hawaii, for one, sent a card to every voter letting them know that election officials would use their signatures to validate mail-in ballots and giving voters a chance to update the one on record. Other states extended ballot receipt deadlines and gave voters more time to cure their ballots, sometimes as the result of litigation. \\nBut initial signs are not encouraging. Republican lawmakers in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona and elsewhere — citing Trump\\'s baseless claims that mail-in voting leads to widespread fraud — are already talking about ways to restrict absentee voting. If only, they say, to restore voter confidence in the system.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

But as 2020, a year defined by the coronavirus pandemic, comes to a close on Thursday, the government appears set to fall well short of that goal. \\nU.S. Army Gen. Gustave F. Perna, chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed, and Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser to federal vaccine effort, said the U.S. has deployed around 14 million vaccine doses as of Wednesday, but only 2.1 million people had received shots. Perna and Slaoui spoke on Wednesday during a news conference. \\nThe vaccination process started on Dec. 14 with frontline health workers getting the shots first. \\nThe number of people vaccinated as reported by Perna and Slaoui contrasts with data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of Thursday morning, the agency said that more than 12.4 million doses of Pfizer\\'s and Moderna\\'s two-dose vaccines had been distributed across the country. The CDC reports just 2.7 million people have been vaccinated. It has said, however, it is working with out-of-date data. \\nPerna said he is also working off of a 72- to 96-hour lag in vaccine reporting data, which he says will be adjusted as time goes on.\\nRegardless of the data used, Perna and Slaoui say the number of Americans vaccinated from the coronavirus is far lower than what they would like. \\n\"We know it should be better, and we are working hard to make it better,\" Slaoui said. \\nMore than 340,000 Americans have died from the pandemic, as of Thursday morning, according to Johns Hopkins University. Health officials warn that January could be the deadliest month since the start of the pandemic, making a successful vaccine distribution all the more critical. \\nThe vaccine rollout has been challenging, but officials expect that between Jan. 8 and Jan. 15, access to vaccines will greatly increase, Perna said. \\nDespite the early hiccups, Perna and Slaoui applauded the multipronged effort involving states and local governments, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies and delivery companies to get the immunization program rolling. \\nPresident Trump criticized state officials for the lag in a tweet this week and urged states to, \"Get moving!\"\\nThe Federal Government has distributed the vaccines to the states. Now it is up to the states to administer. Get moving!\\nNews of the lag in vaccinations comes as reports of problems with state-level distribution processes trickle out. \\nFlorida\\'s county-by-county plan to vaccinate the state\\'s elderly residents created a scramble earlier this week. CNN reported that a southwest Florida county encouraged anyone 65 and older and high-risk frontline health care workers to come to one of its seven vaccination sites â€” no appointment necessary. Each location only had 300 doses, leading to overwhelmed health centers and residents camping out for several hours to get their shots.\\nIn Wisconsin, a medical center employee intentionally left 57 vials of the Moderna vaccine out of its cold storage, leaving health officials with no choice but to destroy them. The vials could have provided around 500 doses. \\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

Psaki was State Department spokeswoman and White House communications director during the Obama administration.\\nPresident-elect Joe Biden\\'s choice for White House press secretary says she will restore a tradition. Unlike her immediate predecessors in the Trump administration, Jen Psaki plans to take questions from reporters each day.\\nPsaki has played similar roles before. She was the spokesperson for the State Department when John Kerry was secretary of state, then President Barack Obama\\'s communications director, and she now speaks for Biden.\\n\"I think more than any point in history ... part of the job of the White House press secretary is to rebuild trust with the American people,\" she says in an interview with NPR\\'s Morning Edition.\\nPresident Trump\\'s first press secretary falsely claimed the biggest inauguration crowd in history. His last made false claims about Trump\\'s election defeat. Psaki promises to be \"as fact-based as I can be.\" She says she won\\'t limit right-wing media outlets\\' access to White House briefings but adds that \"we\\'re not going to allow the briefing room to be a platform for propaganda.\"\\nHere are highlights of the interview, edited for length and clarity:\\nThere\\'s always a tension, of course, in this job, and it\\'s been highlighted in the last few years as to who you\\'re supposed to serve. You\\'re, of course, working for a president, you\\'re getting out the message of the president. But as reporters will be quick to point out, you\\'re on the public payroll and they see your job as working for them or really working for citizens, informing the public. As you see it, who is your boss?\\nOf course, it\\'s an honor to be speaking on behalf of the U.S. government, but my boss is really the American people and there are different entities who are kind of serving the American people. Right? Of course, the president of the United States was elected by them. But the media plays an essential role, too. Right? And that may mean and it will mean, as you know — you\\'ve been in that briefing room — on days we disagree, right, we\\'ll have failures or we\\'ll have things that are mishandled in the government. But, you know, my view is, especially at this moment in history and in a moment where people don\\'t trust the information they\\'re getting from most sources, is to be as steady and as fact-based as I can be.\\nHow do you think you will engage the right-wing media ecosystem, if I can call it that? I\\'m thinking of networks like Fox, but also OANN and Newsmax that have larger and larger audiences. And some of them, like Fox, have, at least on a basic level, acknowledged that Joe Biden won the election. Others are pushing completely discredited theories, but they\\'re all going to be there. They\\'re all going to have an audience, and they\\'re all going to have questions for you.\\nThat\\'s right. And you know, Steve, again, just to go back to how valuable I find and how much I\\'ll rely on my experience at the State Department, there were many, many days where there were journalists — I\\'m air quoting that — who are from Russia or China, essentially arms of the government, you know, arms of the state-run media. And we let them in the briefing room, and they ask questions, and sometimes I had a little fun with them, you know, about who they were asking the question on behalf of.\\nThe first interview that I did after I was announced as White House press secretary was with Chris Wallace on Fox. I do think there is a difference, as I think everybody knows, between some of the anchors and reporters at a network like Fox and some of the personalities. I will not be doing an interview with Sean Hannity. I think that wouldn\\'t serve anybody, including the president-elect, who\\'s the most important factor there. In terms of, you know, [OANN] and kind of other right-wing entities? I don\\'t think my job as the White House press secretary is to give them a bigger platform. But at the same time, when we\\'re at a point when it\\'s COVID-safe and there is a full briefing room, I also don\\'t think it\\'s my job to keep people out.\\nThere seemed to be different approaches at different times in the Obama administration to this question. Of course, President Obama himself did interviews from time to time on Fox News, but the administration also grew frustrated with Fox, tried to shut them out from time to time, was criticized for that. Do you feel that that question is resolved in the way that you just said?\\nYou know, Steve, it\\'s a good question. I don\\'t think it\\'s resolved, no. And I will tell you, my resting place is to be steady and open and share information. But I am no pushover either. We\\'re not going to allow the briefing room to be a platform for propaganda, and we will shut that down as needed as well.\\nThere was an astonishing amount of leaking to the media during the Trump administration. And of course, if you\\'re a critic of Trump, you would argue that was mostly for the public good. Thank goodness we found out what was going on in there might be your attitude. But how do you mean to approach leaks in a Biden administration?\\nI\\'ve told some journalists this, anybody who covered only the Trump administration who\\'s looking for a continuation of the Game of Thrones-style personnel sniping, they will be sorely disappointed, I believe. Our goal is for there to be a return to policy processes and policy briefings and policy experts who are going to be out there explaining what a COVID package may look like or what we\\'re going to do about immigration. And certainly there are leaks around that which may give me a headache for the day, but are not as damaging, I would say, as leaks that are around people\\'s lives or national security issues.\\nI\\'m glad you mentioned national security, because as you know well, President Obama\\'s administration aggressively prosecuted leakers of classified information and that spilled over into investigating journalists, obtaining journalists\\' phone records, tracking their comings and goings from government agencies. Does this administration mean to do the same?\\nObviously, there are different circumstances, as you well know, that came up during the Obama administration. And a number of those were overseen by the Department of Justice at the time. President-elect Biden has not even selected an attorney general yet. Believe me, people want to know who it\\'s going to be. But one of his priorities is returning that department to an independent department, one that does not have political influence from the White House, which will be quite a sea change from our current circumstance. And I suspect those will be questions that future nominee for that role will be asked in a confirmation hearing.\\nJeevika Verma, Jacob Conrad and Scott Saloway produced and edited the audio version of this story.

Bush administration.\\n\"A big difference in my time here, the first time and the second time, is the rise of a nation state threat actors and in particular, their use of cyber to protect their nation state interests and their power,\" Demers said. \"So it\\'s fitting, I think, that we began with a significant election interference hack ... and then here we are at the end dealing with a different kind of cyber activity.\"\\nThis year a number of U.S. government agencies, including the State Department and the Pentagon, have been compromised by another vast intrusion. Demers said he agrees with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\\'s statement that Russia appears to be behind the breach.\\nThe government is still scrambling to understand the breadth of the damage, Demers said, but so far it appears to be limited to the unclassified systems.\\n\"A lot still to be analyzed in terms of both the scope and depth of this hack,\" he said. \"But as you know, there\\'s a lot of confidential and sensitive information that is transmitted and stored on unclassified systems, a lot of information that would be of interest to a foreign state who was trying to learn about our intentions and our planning.\"\\nAn adversary not only can snoop on what a government agency is doing that\\'s not classified but also not public. It also can pair what it learns with what it\\'s gleaning from other sources, including related to secret information or from human spies.\\nFrom what he\\'s seen so far, Demers said the hack appears to be different from Russia\\'s cyberattack and social media campaign against the 2016 U.S. election, when the Kremlin wanted to sow chaos and undermine American democracy.\\n\"This looks more like what a nation state would traditionally try to do through human means, through spies, but trying to do it through technical means and cyber intrusions,\" he said.\\nChina, China, China\\nWhile Russia has grabbed headlines for much of the Trump administration, Demers spent a lot of his time and energy on another foreign adversary — China.\\nTrump administration officials have tagged China as the primary long-term threat to the United States. U.S. officials have accused China of waging a relentless campaign to steal American intellectual property, government secrets and academic information to try to supplant the U.S as the world\\'s preeminent power.\\nTo try to counter that threat, the department launched what it calls the China Initiative. Demers has led that effort, and from that depth of knowledge he says China stands alone in its plundering of American corporate secrets.\\n\"We do see some other countries engaging episodically in economic espionage, but none of them on the scale and sophistication and persistence of the Chinese government,\" he said.\\nRussia, for example, also has tried to steal sophisticated technology that is used in military equipment, and the Justice Department has charged such cases.\\nChina\\'s economic theft, in contrast, is much broader than that, and targets everything from biotechnology to engineering and aerospace.\\n\"It really is an effort to develop the Chinese economy and Chinese companies under this rubric of rob, replicate and replace,\" he said.\\nIt\\'s an accusation that Demers and other U.S. officials have made before --allegations that China denies.\\nU.S. officials say the Chinese steal the technology, replicate the product and then aim to replace the American or European company first in China\\'s market and then on the global market.\\nThe scale of the problem is reflected in the Justice Department\\'s workload.\\nEighty percent of the department\\'s industrial espionage cases involve the Chinese government, while two-thirds of its trade theft cases involve a Chinese company, Demers said.\\nIn the past few years alone, the Justice Department has unsealed one indictment after another related to China.\\nProsecutors have charged American and Chinese researchers and business people for allegedly stealing everything from high-tech wireless design to turbine technology.\\nThe government also has brought cases against U.S. academics for failing to disclose ties to the Chinese government. The prime example of that is an indictment against the chair of Harvard University\\'s chemistry and chemical Biology Department.\\nAnd then there are the cases of political espionage. At least three former U.S. intelligence officers have been convicted of spying for China, while a fourth is facing charges of doing so.\\nThe department\\'s crackdown hasn\\'t brought an end to China\\'s efforts, and it won\\'t. But that doesn\\'t mean it isn\\'t having an effect, Demers said.\\n\"These prosecutors are not silver bullets that are going to make the problem go away,\" he said. \"The Chinese are persistent. The will is there and the resourcing is there. But we\\'re going to call attention to and we\\'re going to shine a light on it and we\\'re going to make their job harder and harder.\"\\nDisrupting tradecraft \\nThe indictments do so, he says, by disrupting China\\'s activities. He pointed to the case of a Chinese intelligence officer who was extradited to the U.S. from Belgium in 2018 for allegedly trying to steal jet fan blade designs from GE Aviation.\\n\"The significance of that wasn\\'t just a disruption of that avenue of economic espionage,\" Demers said. \"The other significance was making the Chinese think twice — and more than twice — about using Europe as a safe place to meet Americans who they were trying to co-opt.\"\\nChinese intelligence officers don\\'t like coming to the U.S. for clandestine work because of the chance of arrest, while Americans considering providing sensitive information to the Chinese often are reluctant to travel to China early on in their relationships with handlers, Demers said. For that reason, Europe often served as a mutually acceptable place for them to meet.\\nDemers said the arrest and extradition from Belgium sent a signal to the Chinese intelligence services that Europe was no longer a safe place for such operations, which was \"very important in terms of disrupting their tradecraft.\"\\nAs Demers\\' time winds down at the DOJ with the looming change in administration, he said he expects his successor will build on what he\\'s done much as Demers built off of his predecessors.\\nThere are two areas — both related to China — that he\\'d focus on if he were sticking around.\\nOne is finding a way to better protect Chinese students at U.S. universities from what he calls \"surveillance and intimidation by their own government.\"\\n\"I think that\\'s an issue we need to look at. I know that\\'s an issue that a number of universities have paid careful attention to,\" he said.\\nThe other, he said, is on China\\'s foreign influence efforts, which are focused on swaying U.S. policy makers to allow China to pursue its interests at home and abroad, such as silencing criticism of Beijing\\'s actions in Hong Kong or Tibet.\\n\"We see them less sort of broadly thinking that they need to undermine democracy and more specifically, focusing on issues that are near and dear to their hearts and not tolerating any criticism of their behavior.\"\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

Whatley says more than 100,000 restaurants are either \"completely closed or not open for business in any capacity.\" A recent survey by his organization found that the number of restaurants offering outdoor dining fell from 74% in early September to 52% in late November.\\n\"It\\'s going to be a hard and tough winter,\" Whatley says. \"As you see outdoor dining not being feasible from a cold-weather perspective, or, unfortunately, from a government regulations perspective, you are going to see more operators going out of business.\"\\nIn recent months, many cities and states have imposed a raft of restrictions on indoor dining, given the high risk of spreading the virus in these crowded settings.\\nMany have capped occupancy for dine-in restaurants. Some halted indoor dining altogether, including Michigan and Illinois. Others have gone even further. Los Angeles and Baltimore have halted indoor and outdoor dining.

But Canlis says there is no easy way to determine whether every member of a dining group is from the same household.\\n\"I\\'m not the governor or the CDC,\" he says. \"I\\'m assuming if you are there at the table, you\\'re taking your health into your own hands.\"\\nThere are new rules, crafted during the pandemic, for outdoor dining structures in Washington that have required Canlis to consider issues such as how to ventilate the yurts properly and sanitize the expensive furniture.\\n\"What is the square inch of yurt volume space?

How many minutes will we allow the yurt to \\'breathe?\\' \" Canlis says.\\nThe structures get cleaned after each dining party finishes a meal and leaves; during the meal service the waiters enter and leave quickly, wearing N95 masks.\\nIgloos, domes and tents: Just how safe are they? \\nAnother, more modern-looking take on outdoor dining involves transparent igloos and other dome-like structures that have become popular with restaurant owners all over the country.\\nTim Baker, who owns the Italian restaurant San Fermo in Seattle, had to order his igloos from Lithuania and assemble them by hand with the help of his son.\\nHis restaurant\\'s policy is that only two people are allowed in an igloo at a time, to cut down on the risk of those from different households gathering together.\\n\"You\\'re completely enclosed in your own space with somebody in your own household. These domes protect you from all the people walking by, on the sidewalk, and the server doesn\\'t go in with you,\" he says.\\n\\n                Tim Baker, owner of Seattle\\'s San Fermo, holds a hot air cannon he uses inside the dining igloos ahead of each seating.

After a thorough ventilation, the device warms up the interior, he says, and also helps disperse any lingering infectious particles.\\nBaker says he consulted with experts in air flow and decided to use an industrial hot air cannon after each party of diners leaves the igloo and before the next set enters — aiming to clear the air inside the structure of any lingering infectious particles.\\n\"You fire this cannon up, and it just pushes the air through really aggressively,\" quickly dispersing the particles, Baker says.\\nHis restaurant\\'s igloos have become a big attraction.\\n\"I\\'m particularly proud of anything that we can do to get people excited right now, because we need it,\" he says. \"We\\'re all getting crushed by this emotionally.\"\\nNot all outdoor dining structures are created equally, says Richard Corsi, an air quality expert and dean of engineering and computer science at Portland State University in Oregon.\\n\"There\\'s a wide spectrum,\" Corsi says. \"The safest that we\\'re talking about is no walls — a roof. And then the worst is fully enclosed — which is essentially an indoor tent — especially if it doesn\\'t have really good ventilation and good physical distancing.\"\\nIn fact, Corsi says some outdoor dining structures that are enclosed and have lots of tables near each other end up being more dangerous than being indoors, because the ventilation is worse.\\nDining that is truly outdoors, with no temporary shelter at all, is much safer because there are \"higher air speeds, more dispersion and more mixing than indoors,\" Corsi says, which means that respiratory droplets harboring the virus don\\'t accumulate and are less concentrated when people are close to each other.\\n\"If they have heaters, then you\\'re going to actually have pretty good ventilation,\" Corsi says, \"The air will rise up when it\\'s heated, and then cool air will come in.\"\\nHe says private \"pods\" or \"domes\" can be fairly safe if they are properly ventilated and cleaned between diners. That also assumes that everyone eating inside the structure lives together, so they have already been exposed to each other\\'s germs.\\nBut Corsi says he is still not going out for a meal in one of the many new outdoor dining creations — \"even though I know they\\'ve got a much lower risk\" of spreading COVID-19 than most indoor alternatives.\\nThis story comes from NPR\\'s health reporting partnership with Kaiser Health News.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

Do you want me to call the ambulance?\\' \" He replied, \"Yeah, I think you better. There\\'s something wrong.\"\\nCarden thought he had heat exhaustion. But it was COVID-19. He was transferred to a hospital about 100 miles away, in the city of Wenatchee, Wash.\\nHe spent a month there — a week of that time on a ventilator.\\n\"It\\'s tough,\" Carden remembers. \"It was tough. I was even ready to give up.\"\\nThe Colville Tribal Council has been doing its best to insulate its community from the pandemic.\\nIn mid-March, the council closed the reservation to non-essential travel. And, when members tested positive for the coronavirus, the council helped them isolate by providing portable toilets, mobile homes and even hotel rooms as needed.\\nBut COVID-19 cases are hitting record highs throughout the state. And the reservation\\'s borders are fluid, so even the tribe\\'s extensive precautions haven\\'t been enough to fully protect Colville members. About 300 people on the Colville Reservation have tested positive for the coronavirus.\\nThat\\'s a big hit for a small community of 5,000 people.

Samuel Little had confessed to 93 murders in more than a dozen states over 35 years.\\nSamuel Little, a convicted murderer who the FBI says is the most prolific serial killer in U.S. history, died Wednesday at age 80.\\nLittle was serving three consecutive life-without-parole sentences for the deaths of three women in the late 1980s in Los Angeles, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said in its announcement of his death.\\nLittle died at 4:53 a.m. An official cause will be determined by the Los Angeles County medical examiner's office. \\nIn 2018, Little confessed to the murder of 93 women nationwide from the 1970s through 2005. The FBI says it believes all of his confessions are credible. \\nSince then, law enforcement officers from around the U.S. have tried to connect details of his confessions to unsolved homicides in their regions. They had verified at least 50 of Little's murder confessions as of last year. \\nWork continues on corroborating more than 40 other cases, an effort that is likely to become more difficult now that Little is dead. \\nLittle's victims and crimes\\nLittle was convicted in 2014 for the murder of the three women killed in Los Angeles in the 1980s, after he was extradited to California from Kentucky on a narcotics charge.\\nOnce in custody for the drug charge, detectives collected DNA from Little that tied him to three unsolved homicides from 1987 and 1989. In all three cases, the women were beaten and strangled, and their bodies were dumped in an alley, a dumpster and a garage, the FBI said. It became Little's modus operandi throughout his 35-year killing spree. \\nLittle's life of crime started when he dropped out of high school and left his home in Ohio in the 1950s. He lived a nomadic life, getting by through stealing, selling his loot and using the money for drugs and alcohol. He had frequent run-ins with police but was often let go after a short stint in jail, the FBI said. \\n\\n                Samuel Little lived a nomadic lifestyle, often stealing to get money for drugs and alcohol. Despite his frequent run-ins with police, he evaded a lengthy stint behind bars until 2012, when he was arrested on a narcotics charge.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Handout/FBI via Getty Images\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nHe chose his murder victims because they were marginalized and vulnerable — often prostitutes or women addicted to drugs, according to the FBI. Their bodies, if they were found, typically went unidentified, and their murders were not carefully investigated.\\nLittle's method of killing — strangulation — didn't always leave reliable signs for local police to determine whether the woman's death was a homicide. The FBI said he usually stunned or knocked out his victims before strangling them, thus leaving no signs of a struggle.\\nLaw enforcement investigation\\nLittle first confessed to the murders in 2018 when he was interviewed by Texas Ranger James Holland. Holland was investigating an unsolved homicide in Odessa, Texas, at the time. Little shared details of the killings because he sought to move prisons and offered information as a deal with police. It's unclear why he wanted a prison transfer or if detectives agreed to make that deal or if Little shared information separate from any agreement with law enforcement. \\nHis confessions touched off a nationwide effort to confirm that Little was tied to  unsolved killings in more than a dozen states. Over the course of almost two years, Little shared detailed information about each of his victims, how he killed them and the general location of their bodies. \\nLittle also drew incredibly detailed pictures of his victims, which the FBI has used to help solve the murders. The FBI created a webpage listing the details Little shared with detectives, his drawings, where he believes each woman was from and Little's videotaped confessions. \\nDetectives hope that with the public's help and the information from Little, they can resolve the remaining 40 unresolved cases.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor\",\n",

Yet President Trump\\'s appointee has sparked an internal outcry by taking bold steps to try to cement his control over at least two of the networks and shape the course of their journalism well into the Biden administration.\\nPack, the CEO of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, also serves as chairman of the boards of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia. Pack and the members of the boards have now added binding contractual agreements intended to ensure that they cannot be removed for the next two years. They could be removed only \"for cause\" subsequently. Pack stocked those boards with conservative activists and Trump administration officials, despite a tradition of bipartisanship.\\nIn other words, although President-elect Joe Biden has already signaled he intends to replace Pack as CEO of the parent agency soon after taking office in January, Pack would maintain a significant degree of control over the networks. Pack and USAGM declined requests for comment.\\nNPR has reviewed the language of the contracts, which have yet to be signed by the new presidents of the two networks — both of whom were appointed by Pack this month. The Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty contract was slated to be approved on Wednesday but appears to have been withdrawn from consideration after internal objections and inquiries from congressional aides, NPR and other media. It is unclear what the future holds for the initiative from Pack.\\nA group of more than two dozen senior officials from Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, including Editor-in-Chief Daisy Sindelar, wrote Pack in sharp protest on Wednesday. The group said in a statement obtained by NPR that Pack\\'s actions \"will compromise the freedom from political influence that for seven decades has characterized Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) as an independent surrogate news organization for countries with no free press of their own.\" (News of the statement was first reported by CNBC.)\\nRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty leaders argue that the CEO over their parent agency, Michael Pack, is seeking to politicize the network and retain control even after President-elect Joe Biden takes office.\\nThe proposed shift in the board is intended to revoke the network\\'s autonomy, they wrote, representing \"precisely the kind of political power maneuver that RFE/RL regularly witnesses in places like Russia, Hungary, Belarus, and Tajikistan. We never thought we\\'d see it from our own oversight agency.\" The statement was signed by regional directors, the head of its central newsroom and the heads of almost all its language services. The letter was also sent to congressional leaders, an inspector general and the head of Biden\\'s transition team for the global broadcasting agency.\\nThe reaction of the new president of Radio Free Asia, Stephen Yates, to the proposed contract is not known. Yates is a former national security aide to former Vice President Dick Cheney who later served as the head of the Idaho Republican Party.\\nRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reaches more than 40 million people each week in 27 languages across 23 countries, including Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, Russia and Ukraine. Radio Free Asia reaches audiences in China, Myanmar, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and North Korea as a \"surrogate broadcaster.\" The networks hire local journalists to provide independent coverage in those countries where a free press is repressed or not viable.\\nIn August, pro-democracy protesters in Belarus chanted \"Radio Svaboda,\" the name of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty\\'s service there since 1954, in a rebuke to the nation\\'s dictatorial president and the state media as evidence grew of rigged elections there. Radio Free Asia\\'s reporting on the repression of Muslim Uighurs by Chinese authorities helped bring the issue to the world\\'s attention.\\nThe stakes for the broadcasters are not merely matters of principle. In Russia, authorities are seeking to discredit Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty by branding its journalists as foreign agents. In Belarus, the regime has stripped RFE/RL\\'s journalists of standard accreditation and protections.\\nThrough the U.S Agency for Global Media, the federal government owns Voice of America and another broadcaster serving Cuba. The agency additionally funds Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks, which are technically independent nonprofit corporations funded through USAGM. Their corporate boards, appointed by USAGM\\'s CEO, approve hirings and firings. They also help guide the overall course and priorities of the networks.\\n\"This appears to be a blatant attempt by Michael Pack to federalize and politicize networks that Congress has repeatedly stated in statute should be nonpartisan and free from day-to-day government control,\" Jamie Fly, former president of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, told NPR. \"As the Kremlin and other authoritarian regimes target RFE/RL journalists, his actions continue to put journalists at greater risk and compromise their mission.\" Fly, a former adviser to Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., was fired by Pack this past summer.\\nThis story is based on conversations with six people inside USAGM and three former USAGM staffers; they spoke on condition that they not be named because of the wave of firings and suspensions initiated by Pack since his arrival in June. NPR was not able to confirm whether USAGM reached a similar contract with the board for the Middle East Broadcasting Networks.\\nPack arrived in June after a rocky two-year confirmation battle.\\nMuch coverage of Pack\\'s brief tenure has focused on his frontal assault on USAGM\\'s leadership and the independence of Voice of America, publicly attacking its reporting, questioning whether it harbored foreign spies and instigating investigations for perceived anti-Trump bias by its reporters. This month, he named a former U.S. State Department official who briefly served as director of the VOA under President George W. Bush to lead the network once again. The new director, Robert R. Reilly, declared his personal views irrelevant to his job after reports on his strongly held views against gay marriage and what he perceives as the intellectual collapse of Islam. This week, Pack named a State Department official without experience in journalism to be VOA\\'s deputy director.\\nNow Pack appears to be seeking to consolidate control anew by deploying bureaucratic language. In the past, the boards were made up of the same people as the primary board overseeing the agency, then called the Broadcasting Board of Governors. (His predecessor, John Lansing, is now CEO of NPR.) Pack was the first CEO to receive Senate confirmation under the agency\\'s new configuration, which dissolved the parent agency board.\\nAlong with Pack, the network boards he appointed include Jonathan Alexandre, senior counsel to the conservative Christian evangelical group Liberty Counsel Action, which has been active against gay and trans rights and which has supported Trump\\'s baseless claims of widespread voter fraud in 2020; financier turned Trump White House aide Robert Bowes; Bethany Kozma, a senior aide at the U.S. Agency for International Development who is an anti-trans activist and is reportedly under investigation for violations of the Federal Records Act; Rachel Semmel, the communications director for the White House\\'s Office of Management and Budget; and Emily Newman, Pack\\'s former chief of staff at USAGM. She most recently joined the legal team filing suit on Trump\\'s behalf to overturn the 2020 election results.\\nSuch boards are typically filled with bipartisan support and people who have expertise in journalism or the regions covered by the networks. Pack dismissed all those boards in June. In October, a District of Columbia Superior Court judge rebuked Pack for wiping away those boards. Judge Shana Frost Matini said Pack acted illegally in the case by replacing the board of a USAGM-subsidized fund that was set up to underwrite technology that enables people living under repressive regimes to access the Internet and communicate securely and privately, including via the tools Tor and Signal. Matini ruled that only the previous board had the right to change the fund\\'s leadership or reconstitute itself. Pack did not act to reinstitute the prior boards.\\nThe Biden transition team did not comment but has said its officials are not receiving expected coordination from the Pack team to ensure a smooth handover. This month, Pack has sought to dismiss senior executives he suspended over the summer, prompting USAGM\\'s general counsel, David Kligerman, to resign instead.\\nDisclosure: This story was reported by NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik and edited by NPR chief business editor Pallavi Gogoi.

Gavin Newsom announced the first known case of the new coronavirus variant in the nation\\'s most populous state during an online conversation with Dr. Anthony Fauci. The first U.S. case was found in Colorado.\\nThe new highly contagious coronavirus strain from the U.K. has spread to Southern California, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced on Wednesday. \\nHe made the statement during an online conversation about the pandemic with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\\'s leading infectious disease expert, but Newsom offered little additional information about the circumstances of the diagnosis. \\nThe first case of the coronavirus variant in the U.S. was detected in Colorado on Tuesday. Experts have said it spreads faster than the common strain.\\n Fauci said he wasn\\'t surprised by reports of the latest case and suggested there are likely others in California and other states due to international travel. \\n\"I don\\'t think that Californians should feel that this is something odd. This is something that\\'s expected,\" Fauci said. He added there is \"no indication that it increases the virulence\" of the infection any more than the variant that has been present in the U.S. since February. Nor is there any evidence it can evade \"the protection that\\'s afforded by the antibodies that are induced by vaccines.\" \\nBritish scientists identified the variant publicly earlier this month, and it has now spread in the U.K. and to other countries.\\nThe soaring number of coronavirus cases in California has stretched many hospitals beyond capacity, with some reporting they are out of intensive care unit beds and ventilators, and are turning away arriving ambulances. As a result, state officials on Monday instructed hospital leaders to prepare for the possibility of implementing \"crisis care\" guidelines, which means rationing treatment, medicine and supplies. \\nA day later, the state\\'s top health official announced an extension of lockdown restrictions for nearly half of California counties, including Los Angeles and others in the San Joaquin Valley. \\nEarlier on Wednesday, Newsom laid out a plan to phase in in-person learning in 2021, starting with students below kindergarten age. He also allocated $2 billion in the proposed budget to help with coronavirus testing, personal protective equipment and other supplies as schools reopen. \\nNewsom explained the recommendation is science-based, relying on evidence indicating children are less likely to acquire the virus in school than in their communities. He also noted increased benefits from in-person instruction, particularly for the youngest students.\\n\"As a father of four, I know firsthand what parents, educators and pediatricians continue to say: In person is the best setting to meet not only the learning needs but the mental health and social-emotional needs of our kids,\" Newsom said. \\nDuring the joint virtual news conference, Fauci acknowledged the delivery and dissemination of COVID-19 vaccines have fallen behind the expected timeline set by leaders of the federal government\\'s Operation Warp Speed. But he remains confident that \"we are going to gain momentum to be able to catch up.\"\\n\"By the time we get to the early fall, we will have enough good herd immunity that we will be able to get to some semblance of normality,\" he said. \\nFauci expects herd immunity will be achieved when 70% to 85% of the U.S. population has been vaccinated. \\n\"I believe strongly that if we pull together as a nation, public health measures seriously and uniformly, I believe that we can crush this outbreak within this time frame,\" he added before signing off. \\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

The two sources familiar with the debate sought anonymity to detail internal White House deliberations.\\nTrump signed a proclamation in June suspending entry to non-U.S. citizens who \"present a risk to the U.S. labor market following the coronavirus outbreak.\"\\nAmong those are holders of high-skilled H-1B visas, used in the tech industry, as well as executive L-1 visas and certain J-1 visas used by au pairs. The measure was aimed at applicants for new visas.\\nThe proclamation was actually an extension of Trump\\'s earlier \"Buy American, Hire American\" executive order, which called for federal agencies to take stronger action to enforce immigration laws to protect U.S. workers.\\nBut the signing in June not only put foreign workers\\' plans on hold, it also left thousands of American parents expecting the help of an au pair scrambling for child care. The ban came at a particularly difficult time as the demand for child care exploded when schools and day cares shut down because of the pandemic. \\nAhead of the moratorium\\'s expiration, advocate groups on both sides of the issue have exerted strong pressure on the White House.\\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce and National Association of Manufacturers sued the Trump administration, charging that the rules would \"devastate companies across various industries\" if allowed to stand. \\n\"Banning critical and skilled workers from entering the country was a mistake, and it disrupted manufacturers\\' fight against COVID-19 at exactly the wrong time,\" NAM\\'s general counsel, Linda Kelly, told NPR in a statement Wednesday. \"Manufacturers\\' legal case halted the ban and ensured we could continue leading our pandemic response and economic recovery. Any effort to extend this misguided and unlawful policy would only hamper recovery efforts and undermine innovation at this consequential moment in our nation\\'s history.\"\\nIn October, a judge blocked the Trump administration\\'s ban on many foreign worker visas, but the ruling only applied to the companies represented by the business groups involved in the case.\\nAdvocates who favor tighter immigration restrictions argue the public health and economic crisis created by the pandemic is still the same as it was six months ago. \\nDan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, wrote a letter this week urging Trump to extend the measures well into 2021, noting it would leave Biden with a tough policy and political decision. \\n\"If Joe Biden does end up entering the Oval Office and quickly rescinds this Proclamation, he will have to answer to the American people and tell them why he decided to increase immigration and restore unfettered access to guest workers in the midst of the greatest economic crisis in living memory,\" Stein wrote in the letter that has also been circulated around Capitol Hill. \\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

Projected dates are fluid,\" the bureau said in the announcement. The Associated Press first reported the bureau\\'s plans to announce a delay.\\nUnder federal law, the commerce secretary, who oversees the bureau, is required to report to the president the latest state population totals within nine months of Census Day, which was April 1.\\nSince the Dec. 31 deadline was put in place by Congress in 1976, the bureau has never failed in delivering the first set of census numbers by the end of a census year. Before the bureau was established, the federal government did miss similar reporting deadlines in the 1800s, and Congress extended them afterward.\\nThe final timing of the 2020 census results\\' release could undermine President Trump\\'s efforts to make an unprecedented change to who is counted in key census numbers before leaving office. This month, the Supreme Court ruled it was too early for courts to weigh in on whether Trump can exclude unauthorized immigrants from numbers that the Constitution says must include the \"whole number of persons in each state.\"\\nIf the first census results are not ready until after Trump\\'s term ends on Jan. 20, it would be President-elect Joe Biden, not Trump, who would get control of the numbers, which are ultimately handed off to Congress for certification.\\nBack in April, the Trump administration publicly acknowledged that because of COVID-19, there was a need for four-month extensions to the legal deadlines for census results, including the demographic data due to states by March 31, 2021 for the redrawing of voting districts.\\nBut the administration made an about-face and stopped asking Congress for those extensions in July, right around the time Trump issued a presidential memorandum calling for unauthorized immigrants to be left out of census apportionment counts.\\n Now, lawmakers will likely have to deal with the fallout of the missed census deadline after the new Congress is in session beginning Jan. 3. \\nSen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii who co-sponsored a bipartisan Senate bill in September to extend census deadlines, is planning to re-introduce the legislation in 2021, Schatz\\'s communication director, Mike Inacay, tells NPR.\\nWhile the delay was long expected in a tumultuous year and there is no penalty specified by federal law for not reporting the first set of numbers on time, the moment is remarkable for the Census Bureau, which had been planning and working towards Dec. 31 for close to a decade.\\n\"I can tell you that nowhere have I seen a greater adherence to statutorily mandated deadlines,\" says Edgar Chen, a former attorney in the Commerce Department\\'s Office of the General Counsel who has also worked at the Justice and Treasury Departments.Barry Robinson, a former chief counsel for economic affairs at the Commerce Department, recalls advising Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross during an internal meeting in 2017 about the legal obligation to adhere to the provided timelines for the census. But Robinson says, especially in light of the pandemic, the government cannot prioritize meeting deadlines over the importance of producing a complete and accurate count.\\n\"I\\'m the first to say that what I\\'m looking at now with the delays caused by the disruption of COVID-19, I think there is a very plausible and justifiable argument for a reasonable extension of time to allow the Census Bureau to fully complete its functions,\" Robinson says.\\nU.S. census historian Margo Anderson notes that until shortly before the 1930 census, the federal government did not have legal deadlines for reporting results to the president or Congress, although census workers were instructed to turn in paper reports by set dates.\\n\"This used to take months to get paper sent around the country so that a lot of times the deadlines would be missed simply because of more localized incidents of a natural disaster,\" says Anderson, author of The American Census: A Social History.\\nAnderson warns that the full implications of the bureau missing the first reporting deadline for the 2020 census may not be clear until later.\\n\"We won\\'t know whether the census is sort of up to snuff until the data start rolling out,\" Anderson says. \"And then we may look back, realizing what was going on was much more significant.

Since early December, she\\'s been tasked with caring for six critically ill patients per shift instead of four.\\nCalifornia\\'s telemetry nurses, who specialize in the electronic monitoring of critically ill patients, normally take care of four patients at once. But ever since the state relaxed California\\'s mandatory nurse-to-patient ratios in mid-December, Nerissa Black has had to keep track of six.\\nAnd these six patients are really sick: they all need constant electronic heart monitoring and many of them are being treated simultaneously for a stroke and COVID-19, or a heart attack and COVID-19. With more patients than usual needing more complex care, Black says she\\'s worried she\\'ll miss something or make a mistake.\\n\"We are given 50% more patients and we\\'re expected to do 50% more things with the same amount of time,\" says Black, who has worked at the Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital in Valencia, Calif., for the past seven years. \"I go home and I feel like I could have done more. I don\\'t feel like I\\'m giving the care to my patients like a human being deserves.\"\\nWe are given 50% more patients and we\\'re expected to do 50% more things with the same amount of time.\\nNerissa Black, telemetry nurse\\nAs COVID-19 patients continue to flood California emergency rooms, hospitals are increasingly desperate to find enough staff to care for all them. The state is asking nurses to take care of more patients simultaneously than they normally would, watering down what many nurses and their unions consider their most sacrosanct job protection: a law existing only in California that puts legal restrictions on the nurse-to-patient ratio.\\n\"We need to temporarily — very short-term, temporarily — look a little bit differently in terms of our staffing needs,\" said Gov. Gavin Newsom, after he quietly allowed hospitals to adjust their nurse-to-patient ratios on Dec. 11. Normally, California law requires a hospital to first get approval from the state before tinkering with those ratios; Newsom\\'s move gave hospitals presumptive approval to work outside the ratio rules immediately.\\nSince then, 170 hospitals, mainly in Southern California, have been operating under the new pandemic ratios: They can require ICU nurses to care for three patients instead of two. Emergency room and telemetry nurses may now be asked to care for six patients instead of four. Medical-surgical nurses are looking after seven patients instead of five.\\nThis is catastrophic and we cannot dodge this math. We are simply out of nurses, out of doctors, out of respiratory therapists.\\nCarmela Coyle, President and CEO, California Hospital Association\\nNurses have taken to the streets in protest, holding socially distanced demonstrations across the state, shouting and carrying posters that read: \"Ratios Save Lives.\" The union, the California Nurses Association, says the staffing shortage is a result of bad hospital management, of taking a reactive approach to staffing rather than proactive: laying nurses off over the summer, then not hiring or training enough for winter.\\n\"What we\\'re seeing in these hospitals is their just-in-time response to a pandemic that they never prepared for: just-in-time staffing, just-in-time resources, not staffing up, calling nurses in on a shift at the very last minute — to boost profits,\" says Stephanie Roberson, the government relations director for the California Nurses Association. \"And we\\'re seeing how nurses are being stretched even thinner.\"\\n\\n                Unionized nurses in California held a rally Aug. 5 as part of a National Day of Action to increase awareness, they say, of ways nurse staffing ratios in hospitals can have an impact on patient safety.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Nerissa Black\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nUnionized nurses in California held a rally Aug. 5 as part of a National Day of Action to increase awareness, they say, of ways nurse staffing ratios in hospitals can have an impact on patient safety.\\nBut hospitals say this is an unprecedented crisis that has spiraled beyond their control. In the current surge, four times as many Californians are testing positive for the coronavirus compared to the summer peak. As many as 7,000 new patients could soon be coming to California hospitals every day, according to Carmela Coyle, who heads the California Hospital Association.\\n\"This is catastrophic and we cannot dodge this math,\" she says. \"We are simply out of nurses, out of doctors, out of respiratory therapists.\"\\nThe state has asked the federal government for staff, including 200 medical personnel from the U.S. Department of Defense, and it\\'s tried to reactivate the California Health Corps, an initiative to recruit retired health workers to come back to work, but that has yielded few people with the qualifications needed to care for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\\nHiring contract nurses from temporary staffing agencies or other states is all but impossible right now, Coyle says.\\n\"Because California surged early during the summer and other parts of the United States then surged afterward,\" she says, \"those travel nurses are taken.\"\\nHospitals\\' next step is to try \"team nursing,\" Coyle says, pulling nurses from other departments, like the operating room, for example, and partnering them with experienced critical care nurses to help care for COVID-19 patients.\\nJoanne Spetz is an economics professor who studies health care workforce issues at the University of California, San Francisco. She says hospitals should have started training nurses for team care over the summer, in anticipation of a winter surge, but they didn\\'t, either because of costs — hospitals lost a lot of revenue from canceled elective surgeries that could have paid for that training — or because of excessive optimism.\\n\"California was doing so well,\" she says. \"It was easy for all of us to believe that we kind of got it under control, and I think there was a lot of belief that we would be able to maintain that.\"\\nThe California Nurses Association has good reason to be defensive when it comes to the integrity of the patient ratio law, Spetz says. It took 10 years of lobbying and activism before the bill passed the state legislature in 1999, then several more years to overcome multiple court challenges, including one from then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.\\n\"I\\'m always kicking their butt, that\\'s why they don\\'t like me,\" Schwarzenegger famously said of nurses, drawing broad ire from the nurse\\'s union and its allies.\\nNurses prevailed in the court of public opinion and in law; rules that put a legal cap on the number of patients per nurse finally took effect in 2004. But the long battle has made nurses fiercely protective of their win. They\\'ve even accused hospitals of using the pandemic to try to roll back ratios for good.\\n\"This is the exercise of disaster capitalism at its finest, where [hospital administrators] are completely maximizing their opportunity to take advantage of this crisis,\" says Roberson.\\nHospitals deny they want to change the ratio law permanently, and Spetz says it\\'s unlikely that they\\'d succeed if they tried.\\nThe public can see that nurses are overworked and burned out by the pandemic, she adds, so there would be little support for cutting back their job protections once it\\'s over.\\n\"To go in and say, \\'Oh, you clearly did so well without ratios when we let you waive them, so let\\'s just eliminate them entirely,\\' I think, would be just adding insult to moral injury,\" Spetz says.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

It\\'s all due to a simple idea: cater to the will of the consumer.\\nWith today\\'s fragmented, social media-fueled pop culture environment, the consumer has never had more power. A random tweet can derail a blockbuster movie; a stream of clever TikTok videos can create a star. And all the biggest media companies are chasing viewer tastes more intensely than ever, focusing on their streaming platforms as consumers create an increasingly personalized, fractured media diet.\\nHere\\'s how all that adds up to the four biggest ways 2020 transformed media.\\n\\n                An AMC movie theater shuttered by the coronavirus in Harwood Heights, Ill.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nOnce the center of the entertainment universe, broadcast television and movie theaters have been hit hard by the pandemic, which has changed consumer behavior in lasting ways.\\nFor broadcasters, the lockdowns in mid-March forced many shows to end their seasons early and kept networks like ABC, CBS, NBC, The CW and Fox from developing many new shows. The fall season, when broadcasters often debut their most-anticipated new series, was pushed back for months. And a few new shows which managed to debut in the fall, like Kim Cattrall\\'s Filthy Rich and John Slattery\\'s NEXT on Fox, are already canceled.\\nSmall wonder media companies like Disney and NBC Universal have reorganized their corporate structures to emphasize streaming.\\nAs a consumer with a pretty decent home media system, I had already set a high bar for movies worth the hassle and cost of viewing in a theater. Add in the possibility of COVID-19 exposure and increased availability of theatrical films on streaming, and that math tilts pretty hard against movie theaters.  \\nI\\'ve often believed the rise of new media doesn\\'t kill old media; it just forces it to change. So broadcast TV and movie theaters won\\'t disappear entirely, but they will be transformed. \\n\\n                Supporters of Donald Trump host a \"Stop the Steal\" protest outside of the Georgia State Capital building on Nov. 21, 2020, in Atlanta, Ga.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Megan Varner/Getty Images\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nDid Joe Biden win the presidency in a fair election? Is the coronavirus a deadly health threat, curbed by widespread mask wearing? Those are basic questions with basic answers — yes, and yes — but Americans have been divided on these issues throughout 2020.\\nThe divide is fed by political partisanship, ideologically driven media outlets and a President one factchecker says issued more than 20,000 false or misleading claims as of July – long before he began challenging November\\'s election result with a series of meritless charges about widespread voter fraud.\\nOften, Trump has seemed to embody what Stephen Colbert once called \"truthiness\"; believing something is true because you feel or want it to be true, regardless of the actual facts. Indeed, it is notable that the top two contenders for factchecking website PolitiFact\\'s \"Lie of the Year\" in 2020 were often echoed by President Trump and Trump-friendly media outlets like Fox News Channel: COVID-19 denialism and a refusal to believe Joe Biden won the presidential election (Coronavirus denial eventually won the top spot).  \\nThe problem was highlighted in a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist survey, which found 61 percent of Americans overall trusted the presidential election result, but just 24 percent of Republicans did.\\nWe are learning this year how much of American democracy depends on the mutual acceptance of norms and basic facts. What we may learn next year, is what happens to democracy if that mutual acceptance drops even further.  \\n\\n                A protester holds up a portrait of George Floyd during a \"Black Lives Matter\" demonstration in front of the Brooklyn Library and Grand Army Plaza on June 5, 2020, in Brooklyn, N.Y.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nThis year, I saw three things happen in television that I never expected. The Bachelor chose its first Black man as a star. Cops and Live PD, two unscripted shows long criticized for stereotyping poor folks and people of color, were canceled. And CBS, a network long criticized for its lack of diversity, announced specific diversity goals for scripted and unscripted series, aimed at boosting the numbers of non-white people throughout their productions.\\nMany factors led to these changes, including the reckoning over systemic racism kicked off by the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police this summer. And CBS has weathered a string of scandals this year involving allegations of abusive workplace conduct or staffers and contestants of color feeling marginalized at shows like All Rise, Hawaii Five-O, Magnum P.I., MacGuyver and Survivor.\\nSkeptical as I am about the TV industry\\'s resistance to real transformation on racial issues — note reports that Cops quietly resumed production after its cancelation by Paramount Network to make episodes for overseas outlets — the success of shows led by non-white characters like I May Destroy You, Lovecraft Country, Small Axe, P-Valley, Ramy and The Last Dance are a good sign.\\nThe world of journalism also saw seismic changes this year, from the resignation of The Philadelphia Inquirer\\'s editor after the newspaper published a headline which offensively referenced the Black Lives Matter movement – it read, \"Buildings Matter, Too\" – to apologies from both The Los Angeles Times and The Kansas City Star for past racism in its coverage on people of color.\\nIt all feels like a long-overdue recognition of the impact systemic racism continues to have on media. The issue goes beyond individual acts perpetrated by specific people; it\\'s about ending habits, strategies, reflexes and traditions within platforms which marginalize non-white people.  \\nThere\\'s more work to be done, especially to feature Hispanic characters and storytellers, who remain among the most underrepresented groups on TV and in journalism.\\nBut at a time when some of the best shows on television are also the most diverse, there\\'s little argument left for failing to reflect the wide array of races, cultures, genders and orientations visible in the wider world. \\n\\n                Quibi, the mobile-first streaming service to specialize in original shows with short five to 10-minute-long episodes, shut down its business operations in October, little more than six months after it launched.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Chris Delmas/AFP via Getty Images\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nThe streaming wars kicked off with big platform launches, from Apple TV+ and Disney+ late last year, to WarnerMedia\\'s HBO Max and NBC Universal\\'s Peacock this year. 2020 showed us the shape of the coming second phase: increasing and refining what\\'s on these platforms, to define the identity of the service and hold your attention.\\nIt\\'s like that scene in every Marvel movie where all the heroes assemble for the big fight: Disney this month announced plans to fill Disney+ with lots of new material – 100 titles annually for the next four years – including at least 10 new Star Wars shows and 11 Marvel programs. Warner Bros. will debut all 17 of its feature films scheduled for release in 2021 on HBO Max the same date they hit theaters. They\\'re both gunning for each other and industry leader Netflix, which still has more subscribers than either Disney+ or HBO Max.\\nAnd even though short-form streamer Quibi died just months after launch, new streaming platforms like AMC+ and Discovery+ have emerged, filled with even more content.\\nThis will be a pitched battle for control of the attention economy – what earns consumers\\' notice and loyalty. In the process, more material will move to streaming television, reaching us through our smartphones, tablets, desktops or smart TVs.\\nThe success of Disney+\\'s launch – Disney says it gained nearly 87 million subscribers since its launch in November 2019, four years sooner than early predictions – resulted from careful planning and help from the pandemic. The service had a library of classic content filled with material from Disney, Marvel, Lucasfilm (Star Wars), Pixar and National Geographic. Disney+ only needed one original hit early on, the amazing reinvention of the Star Wars universe called The Mandalorian. \\nHBO Max had a tougher ride, with a monthly subscription fee of nearly $15 (about twice the cost of Disney+) and a less impressive content library when stacked against Disney+\\'s big franchises. Moving films like The Matrix 4 and the Suicide Squad sequel to HBO Max may help juice consumer interest, but it will come at the expense of angering the film industry and theater owners, who may lose a fortune if Warner Bros. films struggle at the box office.\\nSuccessfully taking advantage of a media trend is all about timing: Sure, everything may likely move to streaming eventually, but did Warner Bros. pull the trigger too soon?\\nThe answer to that question will determine the shape of the world\\'s most powerful entertainment companies for years to come.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

Many major customers, such as food service companies that supply restaurants, weren\\'t buying pork. Prices had fallen sharply. Some hog farmers had no place to ship their animals because so many workers in pork processing plants got sick from COVID-19.\\n\"Our folks need a lifeline,\" said Nick Giordano, top lobbyist for the National Pork Producers Council, on a call with journalists in May. \"Unless there is a large cash infusion from the federal government, we\\'re going to lose a lot of producers.\"\\nOther farmers also demanded government aid. They got their wish.\\nCongress approved about $35 billion in emergency aid to farmers, which came on top of roughly $10 billion in traditional farm subsidies that were already in place. In addition, farmers were able to tap billions of dollars in funding from the Paycheck Protection Program.\\nThe aid, delivered in two separate packages over the course of the year, went to a wide variety of people in agriculture, including corn and soybean farmers, cattle ranchers, and fruit and vegetable producers. The $46 billion in direct government payments to farmers in 2020 broke the previous annual record by about $10 billion, even after accounting for inflation.\\n\"You almost lose track of how much money is going out,\" says Joseph Glauber, formerly the U.S. Department of Agriculture\\'s chief economist, now a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute.\\nYet as the flood of money continued through the summer and fall, most farmers\\' economic worries were receding. \"Commodity prices have come back up and actually are looking better than they\\'ve looked in several years,\" Glauber says.\\nTotal U.S. farm income in 2020 would have been about average, compared with the past 20 years, even without the emergency aid. The massive government payments turned it into the fifth-most profitable year since 1975.\\nFarmers didn\\'t have to prove that they needed help in order to qualify for subsidies. They simply got paid based on their previous production of grain or pigs or cattle. The more crops they grew, the more government money they got, up to a cap of $250,000 per person. Up to three partners in any enterprise could collect that maximum amount.\\nFinal figures aren\\'t yet available, but based on previous years, it\\'s likely that most of the money went to fewer than 100,000 farms. \"I think there is a fundamental question: Why are we providing all this additional aid?\" Glauber says.\\nFarmers contacted by NPR had a variety of answers to that question. Chad Leman, co-owner of a large hog farm in central Illinois, says the federal aid kept some pork producers from going under. \"You would have seen significant fallout had there not been some assistance,\" he says.\\nLeman\\'s farm received more than $700,000 in government payments in 2020, according to USDA data obtained by the Environmental Working Group, a long-time critic of many farm subsidies.\\nLeman\\'s government aid was limited by the cap on payments to any single enterprise, and Leman says his farm still will lose money this year. \"None of us expect to be made whole\" from pandemic-related losses,\" says Leman. \"Our ask was, \\'Help us get to the next year.\\' So I\\'m grateful for what has been done.\"\\nThe EWG regularly publishes the names of wealthy and well-connected people who\\'ve received farm subsidies. They include members of Congress who vote on such payments. Sen. Kelly Loeffler of Georgia, for instance, who is currently campaigning to keep her seat in the Senate, owns a share in a family farming enterprise that, according to EWG figures, received more than a million dollars in federal subsidies over the past two years.\\nOther farmers, who declined to be named, said they were glad to get the money and embarrassed at having to rely on government payouts.\\nRon Rosmann, an organic farmer in western Iowa, says his neighbors rarely talked about the payments, but sometimes made jokes about them. He recalls overhearing one group of older farmers as they played cards. \"I heard one guy say, \\'Yep, got another check from the government today. Didn\\'t need it, but boy! I don\\'t know what to do with it!\\'\"\\nRosmann got some of this money himself, yet he says he\\'s not in favor of the program. \"It has disproportionately gone to the largest producers,\" he says. The move continues to fuel the trend of large farms growing bigger, outbidding smaller farmers when land comes up for rent or for sale.\\nThat, in turn, means fewer people in rural communities, and less life in small towns. It seems paradoxical, but according to Rosmann, passing out money to farmers this way can actually hurt farming communities. \"We just continue to fight a declining and aging population out here,\" Rosmann says.\\nYet more money may be on the way. The latest coronavirus relief package, just approved by Congress, contains another $8 billion in payments to farmers.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

[To hear the conversation, press the audio button above.]\\nDemonstrations spread across Colombia in June. They were sparked by the May killing of a young Black man named Anderson Arboleda in Puerto Tejada, who was allegedly beaten to death by police for breaking pandemic rules. Activists called for justice for Arboleda and other young Afro-Latino men killed by police.\\n\"This message of this movement — Las Vidas Negras Importan — of Black Lives Matter, were young Afro-Colombians who wanted to speak out against police brutality and structural racism,\" Gonzales says. Like much of Latin America, Spanish colonialism informs many societal divisions in Colombia today, she says.\\nYet, most Colombians don\\'t seem to want to talk about racism and colorism, she says. In the most recent census, a majority of Colombians identified as \"no race\" and \"until we acknowledge this debate, we can\\'t change things,\" Gonzales says.\\nIn South Africa, demonstrators came together following the police killing of 16-year-old Nathaniel Julies, a boy of mixed heritage with Down syndrome. Julies was shot and killed in August by police near his home in a neighborhood of Soweto allegedly for being outside his home during a pandemic lockdown.

She says that while protesters directly borrowed some language from the U.S.-based Black Lives Matter Movement, they also made their message uniquely South African by incorporating the phrase \"Colored Lives Matter.\" The word colored, she explains, is an old apartheid segregationist term used to describe someone of mixed heritage in South Africa.\\nActivists in Indonesia inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement also made the message their own. The phrase #AllPapuanLivesMatter went viral, calling attention to the decades-long secessionist movement in West Papua, which has created tensions between the minority Papuans and ethnic Javanese-majority in the country.\\n\"It\\'s hard for West Papuans to find a rent house [sic] because they always get rejected,\" Firdaus says. \"The landlord literally says it\\'s because they are Black and they are Christian. We are majority Muslim.\"\\nFirdaus says ever since Jakarta took control of West Papua from the Dutch in the 1960s as part of the New York Agreement, Indonesia has never allowed Papuans to integrate fully into society.

Ayanna Pressley, who wrote to Biden calling on him act.\\nThe death penalty is unjust, racist, and has no place in any society.President-elect @JoeBiden has the power to halt all federal executions and call for the re-sentencing of those on death row on Day 1. He must use that authority. https://t.co/hJG2e9jzM8\\nIn a letter dated Dec. 15, the lawmakers describe capital punishment as \"unjust, racist, and defective,\" and write that the Trump administration \"weaponized capital punishment with callous disregard for human life.\"\\n\"Ending the barbaric and inhumane practice of government-sanctioned murder is a commonsense step that you can and must take to save lives,\" the lawmakers write. \"We respectfully urge you to sign an executive order on Day 1 to place an immediate moratorium on the country\\'s cruel use of the death penalty and signal your commitment to dismantle its use altogether.\"\\nThe lawmakers are calling on Biden to \"end the federal death penalty\" on his first day in office. That\\'s something that he wouldn\\'t be able to do alone.\\n\"A U.S. president does not have the power to abolish the federal death penalty,\" Dunham said. \"The only way that the federal death penalty can be abolished is an act of Congress signed by a president, or from a court decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. It\\'s clear from the current composition of the Supreme Court that that\\'s not going to happen, so the only way that the Biden administration would be able to end the federal death penalty would be to have some sort of bipartisan support in Congress.\"\\nThe Biden transition team didn\\'t respond directly to questions about the lawmakers\\' letter, or whether he would consider commuting the sentences of every person on federal death row. But during the campaign, candidate Biden pledged to eliminate the death penalty, citing some 160 people who were sentenced to capital punishment since the 1970s and were later exonerated. He\\'s also said he would incentivize states to follow the federal government\\'s example.\\nPressley has sponsored legislation to abolish the death penalty, which Bush says she will support as soon as she takes office. Bush says she sympathizes with family members seeking justice, but that she doesn\\'t \"believe that the way to solve it is to hurt another body.\"\\nWhile the death penalty was not a significant issue raised during the 2020 presidential race, there are sharp differences in the views of Biden and Trump. Biden opposes the death penalty, while Trump is a supporter of capital punishment who painted himself as a law-and-order president during the campaign.\\nThe renewed debate over the death penalty is now playing out as support for the practice is at its lowest point over the past five decades, according to Gallup polling. While there have been declines in support for the death penalty among Democrats and independents, according to Gallup\\'s historical data, support among Republicans has remained relatively steady.\\nIt may be difficult to find bipartisan support in Congress for a repeal of the practice. Unless Democrats win two runoff elections in Georgia, Republicans will hold control of the Senate. And Democrats will have a slim majority in the House.\\nRegardless, Bush says she\\'s hopeful that there is enough support on Capitol Hill to pass the legislation, but that Biden will need to use the bully pulpit to convince the public that the issue is urgent. She\\'s ready to help.\\n\"My hand is raised. The hands of my team are raised. We will help do the work,\" she said. \"If he will call on me. If he will call on Rep. Ayanna Pressley or so many others. We will help do the work. Like, put us in, coach.\"\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

With mild weather forecast and Colorado\\'s breathtaking fall foliage as a backdrop, she was excited — convinced an excursion at Beaver Ranch Park would be the quintessential way to close out months of warm-weather hikes with her \"sister friends.\"\\nStill, when that Sunday morning arrived in 2018, Newton was shocked when her usual crew of about 15 had mushroomed to include about 70 Black women. There\\'s a first time for everything, she thought, as they broke into smaller groups and headed toward the nature trail. What a sight they were, she recalls, as the women — in sneakers and hiking boots, a virtual sea of colorful head wraps, flowy braids and dreadlocks, poufy twists and long, flowy locks — trekked peacefully across the craggy terrain in the crisp mountain air.\\nIt. Was. Perfect. Exactly what Newton had envisioned when in 2017 she founded Black Girls Hike to connect with other Black women who share her affinity for outdoor activities. She also wanted to recruit others who had yet to experience the serenity of spending time with friends in nature, which she fell for as a child attending an affluent, predominately white private school.\\n\\n                Jessica Newton, who formed Vibe Tribe Adventures to encourage other Black women to enjoy the outdoors, listens during a first aid class at Bear Creek Regional Park. Her group offers Black women opportunities to try snowshoeing, fly-fishing, zip-lining and kayaking, as well as hikes.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Kevin Mohatt for KHN\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nJessica Newton, who formed Vibe Tribe Adventures to encourage other Black women to enjoy the outdoors, listens during a first aid class at Bear Creek Regional Park.

She said that we\\'d spooked her horse,\" she says of a woman in a group of white horseback riders they encountered. \"It just didn\\'t make any sense. I felt like, it\\'s a horse and you have an entire mountain that you can trot through, run through, gallop through or whatever. She was just upset that we were in her space.\"\\nEventually, two Jefferson County sheriff\\'s deputies, with guns on their hips, approached, asking, \"What\\'s going on here?\" They had been contacted by rangers who\\'d received complaints about a large group of Black women being followed by camera drones in the park; the drones belonged to a national television news crew shooting a feature on the group. (The segment aired weeks later, but footage of the confrontation wasn\\'t included.)\\n\" \\'Move that mob!\\' \" attendee Portia Prescott recalls one of the horseback riders barking.\\n\"Why is it that a group of Black women hiking on a trail on a Sunday afternoon in Colorado is considered a \\'mob?\\' \" Prescott asks.\\n\\n                (Left to right) Theresa Odello, Jessica Newton, Jan Garduno, Ashanta Cyprian, Joy Eloi and Jewyl Newton follow Lynn Wilson on a hike in a Colorado Springs park.

Studies show \"if you are outdoors for at least five minutes, it literally brings your stress level down significantly,\" says Newton.\\nA man soon arrived who identified himself as the husband of one of the white women on horseback and the manager of the park, according to the Jefferson County Sheriff\\'s Office incident report, and began arguing with the television producers in what one deputy described in the report as a \"hostile\" manner.\\nThe leader of the horseback tour told the deputies that noise from the large group and the drones startled the horses and that when she complained to the news crew, they told her to deal with it herself, the written report said. The news crew told deputies that the group members felt insulted by the horseback riders use of the term \"mob.\" The woman leading the horseback riders, identified in the incident report as Marie Elliott, said that she did not remember calling the group a mob, but she told the officers she \"would have said the same thing if the group had been a large group of Girl Scouts.\"\\nIn the end, Newton and her fellow hikers were warned for failing to secure a permit for their group. Newton says she regrets putting members in a distressing — and potentially life-threatening — situation by unknowingly breaking a park rule. However, she suspects that a similarly sized hiking group of white women would not have been confronted so aggressively.\\n\"You should be excited that we are bringing more people to use your parks,\" added Newton. \"Instead, we got slammed with [threats of] violations and \\'Who are you?\\' and \\'Please, get your people and get out of here.\\' It\\'s just crazy.\"\\nMike Taplin, spokesperson for the Jefferson County Sheriff\\'s Office, confirms that no citations were issued. The deputies \"positively engaged with everyone, with the goal of preserving the peace,\" he says.\\nNewton says the \"frustrating\" incident has reminded her why her group, which she revamped and renamed Vibe Tribe Adventures last year, is so needed in the white-dominated outdoor enthusiasts\\' arena.\\n\\n                Jan Garduno says becoming a member of Vibe Tribe has offered the camaraderie and safety that comes with hiking in a group. Another benefit, she says, is that she\\'s lost about 40 pounds and has been able to keep the weight off.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Kevin Mohatt for KHN\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nJan Garduno says becoming a member of Vibe Tribe has offered the camaraderie and safety that comes with hiking in a group. Another benefit, she says, is that she\\'s lost about 40 pounds and has been able to keep the weight off.\\nWith the tagline \"Find your tribe,\" the group aims to create a sisterhood for Black women \"on the trails, on waterways and in our local communities across the globe.\" This summer, she secured nonprofit status and expanded Vibe Tribe\\'s focus, adding snowshoeing, fly-fishing, zip-lining and kayaking to its roster. Today, the Denver-based group has 11 chapters across the U.S. (even Guam) and Canada, with about 2,100 members.\\nResearch suggests her work is needed. The most recent National Park Service survey found that 6% of visitors are Black, compared with 77% white. Newton says that must change — especially given the opportunities parks provide and the health challenges that disproportionately plague Black women. Research shows they experience higher rates of chronic preventable health conditions, including diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. A 2020 study of more than 17,000 women found that racial discrimination also may increase stress, lead to health problems and reduce cognitive functioning in Black women. Newton says those findings underscore the need for stress-relieving activities, and the power of nature to deliver.\\n\"It\\'s been studied at several colleges that if you are outdoors for at least five minutes, it literally brings your stress level down significantly,\" says Newton. \"Being around nature, it\\'s like grounding yourself. That is vital.\"\\n\\n                Bear Creek Regional Park recreation coordinator Theresa Odello points out different types of plants to members of Vibe Tribe Adventures.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Kevin Mohatt for KHN\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nBear Creek Regional Park recreation coordinator Theresa Odello points out different types of plants to members of Vibe Tribe Adventures.\\nNewton says participation in her group generally tapers off in winter. She is hopeful, though, that cabin fever from the pandemic will inspire more Black women to try winter activities.\\nAtlanta member Stormy Bradley, 49, says the group has added value to her life. \"I am a happier and healthier person because I get to do what I love,\" said the sixth-grade teacher. \"The most surprising thing is the sisterhood we experience on and off the trails.\"\\nPatricia Cameron, a Black woman living in Colorado Springs, drew headlines this summer when she hiked 486 miles — from Denver to Durango — and blogged about her experience to draw attention to diversity in the outdoors. She founded the Colorado nonprofit Blackpackers in 2019.\\n\"One thing I caught people saying a lot of is \\'Well, nature is free\\' and \\'Nature isn\\'t racist\\' — and there\\'s two things wrong with that,\" says Cameron, a 37-year-old mother of a preteen.\\n\"Nature and outside can be free, yes, but what about transportation? How do you get to certain outdoor environments? Do you have the gear to enjoy the outdoors, especially in Colorado, where we\\'re very gear conscious and very label conscious?\" she asks. \"Nature isn\\'t going to call me the N-word, but the people outside might.\"\\nCameron applauds Newton\\'s efforts and those of other groups nationwide, like Nature Gurlz, Outdoor Afro, Diversify Outdoors, Black Outdoors, Soul Trak Outdoors, Melanin Base Camp and Black Girls Run, that have a similar mission. Cameron says it also was encouraging that the Outdoor Industry Association, a trade group, pledged in the wake of the racial unrest sparked by George Floyd\\'s death to help address a \"long history of systemic racism and injustice\" in the outdoors.\\n\\n                (Left to right) Jessica Newton, her 16-year-old cousin Jewyl Newton, and her 14-year-old daughter Joy Eloi pause to take a selfie mid-hike.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Kevin Mohatt for KHN\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\n(Left to right) Jessica Newton, her 16-year-old cousin Jewyl Newton, and her 14-year-old daughter Joy Eloi pause to take a selfie mid-hike.\\n\\n                Vibe Tribe Adventures is one of many groups nationwide seeking to address barriers that often keep Black women from exploring outdoor activities.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Kevin Mohatt for KHN\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nVibe Tribe Adventures is one of many groups nationwide seeking to address barriers that often keep Black women from exploring outdoor activities.\\nEfforts to draw more Black people, especially women, outdoors, Cameron says, must include addressing barriers, like cost. For example, Blackpackers provides a \"gear locker\" to help members use pricey outdoor gear free or at discounted rates. She has also partnered with businesses and organizations that subsidize and sponsor outdoor excursions. During the pandemic, Vibe Tribe has waived all membership fees through January.\\nCameron says she dreams of a day when Black people are free from the pressures of carrying the nation\\'s racial baggage when participating in outdoor activities.\\nVibe Tribe member and longtime outdoor enthusiast Jan Garduno, 52, of Aurora, Colo., agreed that fear and safety are pressing concerns. For example, leading up to the presidential election she changed out of her \"Let My People Vote\" T-shirt before heading out on a solo walk for fear of how other hikers might react.\\nGroups like Vibe Tribe, she says, provide camaraderie and an increased sense of safety. And another plus? The health benefits can also be transformative.\\n\"I\\'ve been able to lose about 40 pounds and I\\'ve kept it off,\" says Garduno.\\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit, editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation, and is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

And Biden wasn\\'t alone among the Democratic presidential contenders. The call for closer ties between domestic policies and what\\'s happening around the world has become an increasingly central theme of the party\\'s foreign policy debates. \\nSullivan has played a leading role in this reorientation. He was a top staffer to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the Obama administration before later serving as then-Vice President Biden\\'s national security adviser. Sullivan was a senior policy adviser to Clinton\\'s 2016 campaign and therefore had a front-row seat to her surprise loss to a candidate who ran on a nationalist and isolationist platform.\\nSince then, Sullivan has repeatedly written and spoken about the need to put America\\'s middle class at the center of foreign policy debates and decision-making. \\nSo, with just three weeks to go before Biden is sworn into office and Sullivan begins occupying a key role in shaping U.S. engagement abroad, I (virtually) sat down with him to discuss the reasons behind that focus, and what it might look like as the Biden administration begins implementing its policies.\\nMeasuring impact on \"ordinary Americans\"\\nSullivan has been frank about the fact that, as he says, the Obama administration didn\\'t do enough to tie foreign initiatives to domestic concerns — particularly when it came to economic policies. \\nI asked Sullivan whether that lack of focus on the American middle class opened the door to Trump\\'s nationalism.\\n\"What produced Donald Trump was a broad amalgam of factors, and so I wouldn\\'t point to any one thing,\" he said. \"But I would say this — I believe that the fact that we did not elevate and center middle-class concerns in our foreign policy and national security meant that we were not delivering for the American people as well as we should have, that we can learn from that, and then we can do better as we go forward.\"\\nLooking forward, he sees the focus — along with a return to more engagement with global allies — as \"a more decisive and sustained rebuttal to Trumpism, by showing that engagement in the world ... can deliver the kinds of tangible results — by protecting people from pandemics, reducing the worst effects of climate change, increasing the protection against the kinds of abuses we see from China and other economic actors. We can do these things.\"\\n\"What Joe Biden is proposing, and what I am reinforcing as the national security adviser, is that every element of what we do in our foreign policy and national security ultimately has to be measured by the impact it has on working families, middle-class people, ordinary Americans here in the United States,\" Sullivan said. \\nSeeking leverage over China \"the right way\"\\nHow will this affect policymaking? Sullivan pointed to China, and the way the Trump administration approached a trade war that escalated to aggressive tariffs.\\n\"What were their negotiating priorities? What did they push for?\" he asked, referring to the Trump administration. \"Well, one of the things they pushed for was access for major U.S. financial institutions to do business in China. And the question I would pose is, what does that have to do with jobs and wages here in the United States, making it easier for the likes of JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs to, to be able to carry out financial activities in Beijing or Shanghai?\"\\nBiden recently told The New York Times that he won\\'t immediately revoke Trump\\'s tariffs on China. I asked Sullivan whether that amounts to a concession that Trump\\'s policies gave the U.S. leverage. Here\\'s his response:\\n\"Well, the president-elect has said from the beginning of this campaign that in order to get China to change its abuses, we do need to build up leverage. We just have to do it the right way, by investing in our sources of strength. So [Biden\\'s] objection to Donald Trump was not trying to seek leverage against China. It was doing it in a way that actually hasn\\'t produced results.\\n\"And one of the major examples of that is that the United States has gone it alone in its trade fight with China, rather than rallying other like-minded democracies, other market economies that collectively comprise 50[%] to 60% of the world\\'s economy, where if we got all of them lined up and went to China with a common agenda to say, \\'We won\\'t accept these subsidies, this intellectual property theft, this dumping,\\' we would be in a position to get China to either change its behavior, or we could collectively impose costs on China for not doing so.\"\\nSullivan and other incoming Biden administration officials have repeatedly signaled they will pressure China on trade, human rights, intellectual property theft and other areas of disagreement — even as they seek to work alongside the fellow global power to confront climate change. \\nThese areas, Sullivan said, are prime examples of how he and other Biden officials will view decisions through that middle-class framework. \\n\"The United States is going to ensure, for example, that we have the kind of free and open Internet where people can engage in commerce and speak freely and not have to worry about surveillance by foreign authoritarians, or not have to worry that the businesses that they either work for, or purchase from, are having to change their practices in fundamental ways to conform to the authoritarian tendencies of other governments. Those are things that affect Americans,\" he said.\\n\"You know, there was an example from [2019] of where China tried to basically censor the National Basketball Association, the NBA,\" he said. \\nChinese authorities cracked down on the distribution of Houston Rockets games within the country\\'s borders after the team\\'s general manager expressed support for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. \\n\"Now, that\\'s not on the same scale and scope as COVID-19, not even in the same sport, let alone the same ballpark,\" Sullivan said. \"But it\\'s the kind of example of where, if we do not speak out on behalf of our values and our way of life, it gets chipped away at in ways that end up encumbering and having an impact on American families and American communities.\"\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

Scientists say the virus was transmitted to humans from another species.\\nAnd one-third of Americans believe that voter fraud helped Joe Biden win the 2020 election, despite the fact that courts, election officials and the Justice Department have found no evidence of widespread fraud that could have changed the outcome.\\nThe poll results add to mounting evidence that misinformation is gaining a foothold in American society and that conspiracy theories are going mainstream, especially during the coronavirus pandemic. This has raised concerns about how to get people to believe in a \"baseline reality,\" said Chris Jackson, a pollster with Ipsos.\\n\"Increasingly, people are willing to say and believe stuff that fits in with their view of how the world should be, even if it doesn\\'t have any basis in reality or fact,\" Jackson said.\\n\"What this poll really illustrates to me is how willing people are to believe things that are ludicrous because it fits in with a worldview that they want to believe.\"\\n Loading... \\n\"That\\'s terrifying\" \\nThe NPR/Ipsos poll of 1,115 U.S. adults was conducted Dec. 21 to 22. The credibility interval for the overall sample is 3.3 percentage points.\\nOne of the most striking poll findings has to do with QAnon, the baseless conspiracy theory that gained widespread attention this year as two of its backers were elected to Congress.\\nThe poll asked respondents whether they believe that \"a group of Satan-worshipping elites who run a child sex ring are trying to control our politics and media\" — the false allegation at the heart of QAnon. While only 17% said it was true, another 37% said they didn\\'t know.\\n\"It\\'s total bonkers,\" said Jackson, \"and yet ... essentially half of Americans believe it\\'s true or think that maybe it\\'s true. They don\\'t really know. And I think that\\'s terrifying that half of Americans believe that could be the case.\"\\nAccording to the poll, 39% of Americans believe another key tenet of the QAnon theory: that there is a deep state working to undermine President Trump.\\nThe president is himself a major source of misinformation, as he continues to make baseless claims about election fraud on Twitter and elsewhere. Conservative media also have devoted hours of coverage to exaggerated or debunked claims.\\nThe NPR/Ipsos poll suggests those claims are having an impact. Two-thirds of Republicans surveyed said they believe that voter fraud helped Biden win the election, and fewer than half of Republicans said they accept the outcome of the election.\\n\"There\\'s just too much information out there,\" said Brooke Williams, a Republican voter and self-described QAnon follower from Oro Valley, Ariz., during a follow-up interview with NPR. \"I can\\'t see how anybody is not thoroughly convinced that Biden was illegally elected.\"\\nIn contrast, only 11% of Democrats think voter fraud helped Biden win the election, and 93% accept the outcome.\\n Loading... \\nWhom Americans trust\\nOverall, most respondents said they do want to see a peaceful transition to a Biden administration in January, though many are worried about political violence over the next four years.\\nThe vast majority of Americans said they\\'re also worried about the spread of false information, with 4 out of 5 poll respondents saying they\\'re concerned about misinformation related to the coronavirus and vaccines in particular.\\nBut Republicans were more likely than Democrats to believe misinformation about the virus, including that it was created in a lab in China and that COVID-19 is no more of a \"serious threat\" than the seasonal flu.\\n\"I think it was deliberately released by China,\" said Jon Costello, a Republican from Huntsville, Ala., who responded to the poll. \"I think this big thing of shutting down businesses, shutting down education systems ... is all part of a plan to break the spirit and the will of Americans.\"\\nPoll respondents of both parties expressed skepticism about the vaccines that are now being distributed in the U.S., though Republicans were less likely than Democrats to say that they would \"take the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it is made available to me.\"\\n\"I shouldn\\'t have to take a vaccine for something that was man-made,\" said Shaena Castro, a Democrat who lives in New York City. \"I guess you can call me a conspiracy theorist or whatever, but yeah, I am convinced that it\\'s man-made.\"\\nWhen asked whom they trust, respondents mostly pointed to the people they encounter in their daily lives. Personal physicians scored highly, as did faith or spiritual leaders.\\nPoliticians and media figures did not fare as well.

Poll respondents from all demographics answered this question incorrectly — but they were even more likely to do so if they were Republicans and if they got their news from Fox News or conservative online outlets like Breitbart or the Daily Caller.\\nRecent misinformation held more sway than some older conspiracy theories.\\nAbout 60% of Americans correctly answered that former President Barack Obama was born in the United States and that several mass shootings in recent years were not staged hoaxes. And about 70% correctly answered that humans do play a significant role in climate change — roughly the same percentage who believe astronauts landed on the moon in the 1960s and \\'70s.\\nIt\\'s also clear from the poll results that Americans are worried about misinformation, even if there\\'s no clear prescription for what to do about it.\\nNearly 70% of respondents said they are concerned that information they receive on social media is inaccurate; a similar percentage is concerned about foreign interference in U.S. social media.\\n\"I\\'m concerned to see so many people living in a false reality, seeing relatives honestly believe that this was some kind of rigged election,\" said William Street, who lives in northeast Mississippi.\\n\"It terrifies me that people can be that misled and believe conspiracy theories like that,\" Street tells NPR. \"I\\'m concerned that with even just a little prodding from this man in office, they could be led to do very desperate things.\"\\nNPR senior producer Marisa Peñaloza contributed to this story.\\n\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

The move by the two chambers overrides Gov.

Baker vetoed the bill on Christmas Eve after the legislature rejected his revisions. In a letter to lawmakers, the Republican governor said he \"strongly\"  supports the right to access reproductive health care, including the provision in the bill that would make abortions available after 24 weeks of pregnancy if the fetus would not survive after birth, State House News Service reported. \\nHe also agreed that a 24-hour waiting period before an abortion is unnecessary. However, he objected to revisions to the law that removed legal barriers for minors seeking to terminate a pregnancy. \\n\"I cannot support the sections of this proposal that expand the availability of later term abortions and permit minors age 16 and 17 to get an abortion without the consent of a parent or guardian,\" Baker wrote.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

Indeed, in 2012 Rosiello received a liver transplant in Cleveland.\\nOrgan transplants are not as simple as someone dies somewhere, and then someone else — like John Caso of Johnson City, Tenn. — gets a new heart. As Caso learned, surprising twists and turns in the system can throw you for a loop.\\n\"You never expect to get the call that says, \\'We have an organ, but ...\\'\" Caso says.\\nIt was 2004 when he got that call, not long after he\\'d been added to the waiting list for a new heart. The hitch in this case: The donor heart they were calling about was coming from a person who had traded sex for drugs. Doctors couldn\\'t guarantee that there wouldn\\'t be infections.\\n\"I followed the advice of the surgeon and turned it down,\" Caso says. He would go on to turn down several more donor hearts before accepting one in 2016.\\nCaso could afford to be a little more choosy than some U.S. patients, because he lives in the Appalachian mountains of Northeast Tennessee, where the region\\'s poor health outcomes — like higher rates of strokes, fatal car crashes and gunshot deaths — actually benefit organ recipients. That\\'s because those causes of death are more likely to yield healthy organs that can be donated to others.\\nIn other parts of the U.S., particularly along the coasts, the causes of death are less likely to lead to transplantable hearts, lungs and other organs.\\nThis sort of variation across the country has resulted in inequities in the ease of receiving an organ from someone who has died nearby — and, as a result, led to recent changes in the rules governing how organs are distributed nationally. In turn, transplant centers in the South and Midwest have gone to court to fight those changes.\\nThe revised policy, recently finalized by the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, including changes that are set to take effect in 2022, is meant to boost the overall number of transplants performed in the U.S., so fewer people die waiting. (Currently around 20 people per day die on waiting lists.) But the rule change also highlights other chronic geographic disparities.\\nSome organ procurement organizations — called OPOs — point to the geographic differences in causes of death as the main reason they collect fewer organs compared to OPOs in other regions.\\nBut is that the full reason behind the disparities? No one can say for sure, because data-gathering has never been standardized across the United States — OPOs have always self-reported their data. Under the new rules, that will end.\\nInstead, all 58 OPOs in the U.S. will be assessed under the same accounting rules — counting the number of organ donations achievable as a percentage of the total number of hospital patients under age 75 who die in that region from certain causes of death known to be favorable for organ donation.\\nBefore the rule change, OPOs could themselves determine whether a particular death should \"count\" as a potential candidate for organ donation. Critics of that older process say it made it hard to know why organ scarcities were occurring in some regions but not others.\\n\"This is about understanding why certain areas are not performing well and seeing if we can fix them,\" says Dr. Seth Karp, director of the transplant program at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.\\nHe says the new federal rules hold these nonprofits accountable for all the potential donors they may have missed.\\nHe notes that under the new accounting, Las Vegas yields roughly four times as many organ donations as New York City.\\n\"If it is true that certain parts of the country should only be able to recover one-fourth of the number of donors as another part of the country, because there are inherent differences in those areas of the country, that\\'s fine. We can live with that,\" he says. \"I just find that hard to believe.\"\\nThen there\\'s the other systemic problem that organ procurement officials say they have little control over, something the new rules don\\'t address: finding recipients for all the organs that are available.\\n\\n                Transplant surgeon Dr. Matthew Cooper cradles a donated kidney at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C., in 2016. Organ procurement is a delicate process, he says, requiring compassion and tact in talking with families after a loved one has died.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Molly Riley / AP\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nTransplant surgeon Dr. Matthew Cooper cradles a donated kidney at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C., in 2016. Organ procurement is a delicate process, he says, requiring compassion and tact in talking with families after a loved one has died.\\nFor example, earlier in December the New England OPO that stretches from Connecticut to Maine had the case of a 59-year-old who had suffered a fatal bicycle accident. That person\\'s family signed off on organ donation, and the region\\'s organ procurement organization considered the kidneys to be in good shape. But they got no takers.\\n\"We made thousands of organ offers and ultimately weren\\'t able to place those kidneys for transplant, despite ... almost 33,000 offers,\" says Alexandra Glazier, CEO of New England Donor Services.\\nOnce organs are turned down a few times, she says, other surgeons assume there must be something wrong with them, and also turn them down. A likely reason is that transplant centers have to contend with data assessments, too; they are rated by how many of their patients survive for a year or longer after transplant, among other measurements.\\nThat\\'s why Glazier questions whether the new rules meant to increase transplants will actually achieve that goal. The revised guidelines focus on organ procurement, but don\\'t subject surgeons and transplant centers to additional scrutiny of their decisions.\\n\"We know that there is opportunity to do a lot better system-wide,\" Glazier says. \"But what this requires is the full engagement of \\'the system.\\' \"\\nShe objects to another part of the new policy, too: Any low-performing OPO that doesn\\'t improve is subject to being taken over by a high performer. Glazier calls it a \"hunger games\" scenario that, in her view, could lead to even fewer organ transplants.\\nIt\\'s easy to point fingers, says Dr. Matthew Cooper. He directs kidney transplantation at Medstar Georgetown in Washington, D.C.\\nOrgan procurement organizations have a delicate job, he says.\\n\"Perhaps it\\'s not as simple as you think it is,\" he says. \"It\\'s not as simple for me as a transplant program to go to a donor family and say \"Listen, why aren\\'t you donating your organs?\\' I\\'d probably be really bad at that.\"\\nAnd Cooper worries that a punitive approach won\\'t benefit any of the nonprofits doing the work.\\n\"If we solely focus on one piece,\" Cooper says, \"I fear we\\'re going to have more chaos than we\\'re going to have value.\"\\nThis story comes from NPR\\'s health reporting partnership with Nashville Public Radio and Kaiser Health News. \\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

Meuthen criticized the party\\'s right wing in his speech. The AfD held the two-day congress in person, as total confirmed coronavirus infections passed the 1 million mark.\\nLike many other far-right political parties, Germany\\'s Alternative for Germany (AfD) was founded on outrage. It began as a response to the anger and fear some Germans felt when their stable and secure currency, the Deutsche Mark, was subsumed by the euro. It grew in popularity as it shifted its attention to immigration, and peaked when it attacked German Chancellor Angela Merkel\\'s decision to allow a record number of asylum seekers into Germany.\\nIn 2017, the AfD won 94 seats in the German parliament, the Bundestag. It became the country\\'s third-largest political party and the official opposition to the centrist coalition government. The AfD\\'s supporters and enemies alike expected the party might grow even stronger in the next election, in 2021.\\nThe pandemic of 2020 changed all that.\\nAfter polling around 15% for most of 2019, the AfD\\'s support plummeted this year. The latest surveys show it polling at around 9%.\\nAt first glance, this decline has a simple explanation. Like governments elsewhere, Germany\\'s ruling centrist coalition gained support as it confronted the coronavirus. Public approval of Merkel herself skyrocketed.\\nUwe Witt, an AfD member of the Bundestag, tells NPR the government stole the AfD\\'s thunder.\\n\\n                AfD parliamentary leader Alexander Gauland, shown here in the Bundestag on Oct. 29, has described the German government as a \"corona dictatorship\" with a \"war-cabinet\" attacking the basic rights and freedoms of the German people.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Maja Hitij/Getty Images\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nAfD parliamentary leader Alexander Gauland, shown here in the Bundestag on Oct. 29, has described the German government as a \"corona dictatorship\" with a \"war-cabinet\" attacking the basic rights and freedoms of the German people.\\n\"The main topics of the AfD — such as a greater stress on German national interests, closed European external borders, support of local small and medium-sized industry — were temporarily realized by the government during the corona pandemic,\" he says. \"That is why opposition parties always have polling losses in a crisis.\"\\nBut there is more behind the AfD\\'s current crisis.\\nThe AfD has made a significant U-turn in its approach to the pandemic. In March, the party\\'s parliamentary leader, Alexander Gauland, was complimentary about the Merkel-led government\\'s handling of the crisis. \"Government policy contains many insights that we believe are correct and that we share,\" Gauland told the Bundestag. Seven months later, though, he described the government as a \"corona dictatorship\" with a \"war cabinet\" attacking the basic rights and freedoms of the German people.\\nThe AfD\\'s attempts to reposition itself have exposed deep splits in the party and its leadership, and confusion about what its policies really are.\\n\"Right at the beginning of the pandemic, the AfD even criticized the federal government for not fighting the pandemic consistently enough,\" says political scientist Ursula Münch of Munich University. \"But since the AfD always strives for a unique selling point in political competition, it quickly decided to take a completely different course.\"\\nFor some AfD members, that new course meant cozying up to the Querdenker (\"lateral thinker\") movement — a loose grouping of libertarians, vaccination opponents and conspiracy theorists that has steadily gained support for its protest rallies against government health restrictions and lockdowns.\\n\\n                A demonstrator holds a sign saying Querdenker (\"lateral thinker\") during a protest against Germany\\'s coronavirus measures in Düsseldorf in September.

The embrace by some AfD members of the Querdenker movement — a loose grouping of libertarians, vaccination opponents and conspiracy theorists — has cost the party support.\\nA significant section of the AfD holds similar views. A recent poll showed that 24% of AfD supporters believe the \"pandemic is a conspiracy to oppress people.\"\\nMünch says the embrace of the Querdenker movement has hurt the AfD among its usual supporters. \"The \\'moderate\\' former AfD voters, who voted for the party mainly because they rejected Angela Merkel\\'s refugee policy, are obviously not looking to be ruled by populist gamblers,\" she says.\\nUndeterred, some AfD members have continued to push the new agenda, encouraging supporters to describe face coverings as \"a muzzle\" and attacking government health restrictions as arbitrary and inconsistent. Some data on the spread of the virus suggests Germany\\'s recent spike in COVID-19 infections is particularly severe in areas with a high proportion of AfD voters, although health experts caution that any apparent link needs a lot more research.\\nMatters came to a head in November, while the Bundestag discussed the government\\'s latest legislation aimed at controlling the pandemic as protesters tussled with police outside the parliament. Two AfD representatives invited some militant \"guests\" into the building, who then harassed and harangued other members of the Bundestag, including ministers.\\nThe episode was condemned by all the other parties and led to a rare apology from the AfD leadership.\\nDuring the AfD\\'s convention, also in November, its co-leader Jörg Meuthen criticized the right wing of the party, its proximity to the Querdenker movement and use of the term \"corona dictatorship.\" Gauland later claimed that Meuthen had rejected half the party with his speech.\\nAt this point, there are two wings of the AfD fighting each other, says Münch. \"Some want to get out of the ungrateful role of the opposition and participate in government,\" she explains. \"The others despise this accommodation of the system they hate and want to become more radical.\"\\nMünch predicts the AfD will perform significantly worse in next fall\\'s election than it did in 2017.\\n\"Although the relatively small group of hardcore AfD supporters remains set,\" she says, \"more moderate voters could be deterred by the party\\'s quarrels and self-centeredness.\"\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

He was detained with about 50 other people at a roadblock in Pamplona.\\nJust three days after crossing the border into Colombia to escape food shortages, joblessness and authoritarian rule in Venezuela, Alexander González says he\\'s shocked by the xenophobia of his adopted homeland.\\n\"Colombians treat Venezuelans badly,\" says González, 19, as he takes a breather in the Colombian town of Pamplona before setting off on foot for the capital of Bogotá. \"They practically spit in our faces.\"\\nAmid Venezuela\\'s worst-ever economic crisis, which is widely blamed on corruption and mismanagement by President Nicolás Maduro\\'s socialist regime, more than 5 million Venezuelans have fled the country.\\nThe exodus began in 2014 and, since then, about 2 million Venezuelans have settled in neighboring Colombia, with smaller numbers moving to Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Chile and elsewhere in Latin America. Now, this massive influx of migrants and refugees is creating a backlash in Colombia, with some people blaming the newcomers for a host of problems, including rising crime, unemployment and the spread of COVID-19.\\nThe message that Venezuelan migrants are no longer welcome comes from average Colombian citizens and powerful government officials alike. Last week, for example, Colombian President Iván Duque announced that undocumented Venezuelan migrants would not receive vaccinations for the coronavirus despite concerns from refugee agencies that this policy could lead to more infections.\\n\"Of course they won\\'t get it,\" Duque told a Bogotá radio station. \"Otherwise we would have a stampede with the whole world crossing the border to get vaccinated.\"\\nResearch shows that Venezuelans in Colombia are more likely to be the victims of crime rather than the perpetrators. But after a Venezuelan migrant stabbed to death a bus passenger in Bogotá in October, Mayor Claudia López declared: \"I don\\'t want to stigmatize immigrants but there are some Venezuelans involved in crimes who are making our lives impossible.\"\\nMeanwhile, local officials all across Colombia complain that they\\'ve been left largely on their own to deal with a flood of sick and impoverished Venezuelans. This burden comes at a time when the pandemic is already severely straining town and city budgets and is filling up local hospitals with COVID-19 patients.\\n\\n                People who migrated from Venezuela to Colombia are deported.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    John Otis for NPR\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nPeople who migrated from Venezuela to Colombia are deported.\\nInitially Colombians offered a warmer welcome to the migrants — perhaps because many knew how it felt to be uprooted. In the 1980s and 1990s, oil-rich Venezuela provided safe haven and jobs to thousands of Colombians fleeing a drug-fueled guerrilla war.\\nBut attitudes are changing now that the exodus of Venezuelans has become the largest refugee crisis in Latin American history and rivals the magnitude of the Syrian refugee crisis. A recent Gallup poll showed that 69% of Colombians have an unfavorable perception of Venezuelan migrants.\\nAmong those who have soured on Venezuelans are many residents and officials Pamplona. Home to 60,000 people and located on the main highway to Bogotá and other major cities, Pamplona has become a pit stop for migrants, with some 300 arriving here every day.\\n\"Pamplona is overflowing with migrants and we have no way to deal with it,\" says Humberto Pisciotti, the mayor of Pamplona, which is located near Colombia\\'s busiest border crossing with Venezuela. In an interview with NPR, he added: \"Now we have chaos.\"\\nMany beg for food at houses and restaurants or seek medical care at the town\\'s hospital. Some walk around without face masks. Due to the lack of a shelter for refugees, they sleep outdoors and bathe in rivers and streams.\\nTo dissuade them from bunking down near their homes, some residents pour used motor oil on sidewalks and driveways while town officials have cordoned off parks with yellow tape. Still, the sight of the forlorn campers can provoke xenophobic outbursts.\\n\"They come here at night like rats,\" says Carlos Espitia, 62, a retired welder, who complains that migrants have taken over the sidewalk in front of his house. \"I have to clean up their poop.\"\\n\\n                Pamplona resident Nelson Maldonado helped organize a demonstration against the town\\'s plan to open a shelter for the migrants.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    John Otis for NPR\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nPamplona resident Nelson Maldonado helped organize a demonstration against the town\\'s plan to open a shelter for the migrants.\\nNearly all the migrants leave after a day or two, but town officials say a small number have joined street gangs that sell drugs and rob stores. As a result, residents like Nelson Maldonado view all Venezuelans with suspicion.\\n\"It would be fine if they were people who contributed to the economy,\" Maldonado says. \"But they only come here to commit crimes.\"\\nMaldonado, who is the president of a neighborhood association in Pamplona, helped lead a demonstration in September against a plan to build a shelter for migrants. The protesters feared the shelter would attract even more Venezuelans to their town and, after they blocked roads for several hours, Pisciotti, the mayor, announced that he had scrapped the plan.\\n\"I\\'m not xenophobic,\" Pisciotti said. \"But I can\\'t go against the community.\"\\nEven townsfolk who lend a helping hand to Venezuelans have come in for criticism.\\nAmong them is Marta Duque, who, with the help of international agencies, runs an aid station out of her cramped house on the edge of Pamplona. There, migrants line up to receive food, used clothing — and advice on how to safely travel over the freezing Andean Mountain peaks that surround the town.\\n\\n                Marta Duque hands out food to a migrant from Venezuela.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    John Otis for NPR\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nMarta Duque hands out food to a migrant from Venezuela.\\n\"The neighbors are always complaining,\" Duque says (no relation to President Duque). \"But I would feel a lot worse if I didn\\'t help the migrants.\"\\nAs the backlash grows, Colombian police are stepping up operations to deport undocumented migrants who make up more than half of all Venezuelan newcomers, according to immigration officials.\\nIn one such operation near Pamplona, police officers set up a roadblock and detain about 50 Venezuelans, including José Páez. Explaining his decision to leave his homeland, Páez points out that his weekly salary as a baker in Caracas was worth less than a dollar — not even enough to buy a bag of rice. His possessions now amount to a small backpack stuffed with clothes and two peaches that he pulls from his pants pockets.\\nTurning to the police, Páez begs them to allow him to continue his journey on foot toward Bogotá.\\n\"I\\'ve been walking for two days,\" he says, \"and now you are going to send me back?\"\\nIgnoring his pleas, the police put Páez and the other migrants aboard trucks bound for the Venezuelan border.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

It\\'s a social life and a community, an athletic center and a place to get meals that aren\\'t available at home. The coronavirus pandemic has disrupted — and continues to disrupt — the lives of U.S. students in profound ways.\\nMany kids haven\\'t set foot in their schools since March, when most in-person schooling shut down across the United States. Teachers are working tirelessly to educate their students online, but they are growing increasingly anxious about the kids who aren\\'t showing up at all.\\nAn estimated 3 million students may have dropped out of school learning since March, according to Bellwether Education Partners, a national nonprofit that focuses on underserved youth. The group\\'s study cited a lack of Internet access, housing insecurity, disabilities and language barriers as major obstacles to attending virtual classes during the pandemic.\\n\"It is really, really unsettling,\" says Alex, a teacher in western Virginia, who asked that her last name not be used for fear of repercussions for speaking out. \"I think people don\\'t realize how much we need to see these kids. A lot of times in schools, we are the first line for seeing signs of child abuse, for seeing signs of food insecurity. And you don\\'t have that with virtual students. Especially when they ghost.\"\\nThat \"ghosting\" is a constant problem for school employees who track attendance in both urban and rural districts. Staying connected to students with little to no Internet access has become impossible in many cases.\\n\"They find ways to disappear when they don\\'t want to be found,\" says Karen Smith, who has been an educator for more than three decades and teaches high school English in a rural area on Maryland\\'s Eastern Shore.\\n\"Many of our students and even our faculty and staff don\\'t have reliable Internet,\" she says. \"We experimented with portable Wi-Fi, and in our neck of the woods, that\\'s not really a feasible thing because you have to have a signal to bounce off of. And in some cases, they\\'re rural enough that they don\\'t have that option.\"\\nLocated about 150 miles northwest of Smith\\'s school district, Baltimore might seem like a different world. But families in Evan Murray\\'s urban school district face many of the same challenges.\\n\"The Wi-Fi has been problematic for everybody,\" says Murray, who has worked in education for 13 years. He\\'s now employed by Baltimore City Public Schools as a community school site specialist, communicating with students and their families about what they need for both their academic and nonacademic lives.\\nSmith\\'s and Murray\\'s two Maryland communities have nearly identical poverty levels, hovering just above 20%. So when a student is absent, missed lessons aren\\'t the only concern.\\n\"Our kids already rely on the teachers and the staff for a lot of different levels of support,\" such as food and health care resources, Murray says.\\n\"We have a bunch of kids who rely on the morning breakfast and lunch programs to eat throughout the day,\" he continues. \"We need to communicate and check on our babies, our scholars, and make sure they\\'re fine.\"\\nSmith, in rural Maryland, is worried about that too.\\n\"It\\'s really created a hardship for those families, and I think that is one of the reasons that there\\'s been such a push to go back to school in person,\" she says, also noting that schools act as child care for many working parents.\\nThe pandemic has made life unpredictable, and teachers see that reflected in class participation.\\n\"Some of the students are in and out of touch,\" says Smith. \"There\\'s one student that I haven\\'t heard from her in, I don\\'t know how long.\"\\nSmith says she has been trying to reach the student by phone but senses that she might be dealing with a precarious family situation.\\n\"I think they\\'re hesitant to be upfront about what\\'s going on at home sometimes,\" she says.\\nLast week, Smith lost her own Internet access at home about 10 minutes before class was supposed to start. After that, she decided to start working out of the empty school building. The loud, buzzing hallways she remembers, filled with young voices and bodies, are now silent. After a few minutes, the motion-sensitive lights go off.\\nOne thing she and her colleagues often think about is how they don\\'t necessarily even know what their students look like.\\n\"They could walk in my room, face-to-face, and I would have absolutely no idea,\" she says. \"I don\\'t even know if I\\'ve heard their voices.\"\\nBefore the pandemic, Murray of the Baltimore schools says he spent a lot of time doing things like getting uniforms for kids and making parents feel involved. Now, his job deals largely with technology issues — getting tablets and other equipment out to students\\' homes, assuming he has the correct address.\\nOtherwise, he spends much of his workday on the phone, trying to track down students who have fallen off the grid.\\nOn a recent day, he says he spent two hours — from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. — trying to contact 13 kids. \"We have to, because there are still a number of students we haven\\'t gotten, we haven\\'t made contact with.\"\\nThere are wrong numbers, kids who are tracked down to a different state, and home visits — when they were happening — where no one comes to the door.\\nEchoing Smith\\'s experience in rural Maryland, Murray says he thinks there is shame or embarrassment, from students or their families, behind those unanswered messages and knocks on the doors.\\nAnd amid worries that some of the temporary student absences could become permanent, Murray says schools need to be relentless in their outreach efforts.\\n\"You can\\'t go in this like you\\'re waiting and wishing for students to come back,\" he says. \"It\\'s not going to happen.\"\\nJolie Myers edited the audio story.

He\\'s an outreach worker with Healthy Little Havana, going door to door to talk to people about getting tested for COVID-19.\\nLittle Havana is a neighborhood in Miami that, until the pandemic, was known for its active street life along Calle Ocho, including live music venues. There you can find examples of the quintessential ventanita serving Cuban coffee and a historic park where men gather to play dominoes.\\nBut during the pandemic, a local group called Healthy Little Havana is zeroing in on this area with a very specific assignment: convincing residents to get a coronavirus test.\\nThe nonprofit has lots of outreach experience. It helped with the local count for the 2020 Census, for example, and because of the pandemic did most of that work by phone. But this new challenge, community leaders say, needs a face-to-face approach.\\nThe group\\'s outreach workers have been heading out almost daily to walk the quiet residential streets, to convince as many people as possible to get tested for the coronavirus. On a recent afternoon, a group of three — Elvis Mendes, María Elena González and Alejandro Díaz — knocked on door after door at a two-story apartment building. Many people here have jobs in the service industry, retail or construction; most of them aren\\'t home when visitors come calling.\\nLisette Mejía did answer her door, holding a baby in her arms, and flanked by two small children.\\n\"Not everyone has easy access to the internet or the ability to look for appointments,\" Mejía replied, after being asked why she hadn\\'t gotten a test. She added that she hasn\\'t had any symptoms, either.\\nThe Healthy Little Havana team gave her some cotton masks and told her about pop-up testing planned for that weekend at an elementary school just a short walk away. They explained that people might lack symptoms, but still have the virus.\\nFor many low-income Miamians, getting a coronavirus test is still too difficult \\nThe nonprofit organization is one of several receiving funding from the Health Foundation of South Florida. The foundation is spending $1.5 million on these outreach efforts, in part to help make coronavirus testing as accessible and convenient as possible.\\nThere are a number of social and economic reasons that make it difficult for some Miamians to get tested, treated, or isolate themselves if they are sick with COVID-19. One big problem is that many people say they can\\'t afford to stay home when they\\'re sick.\\n\"People usually rather go to work than actually treat themselves — because they have to pay rent, they have to pay school expenses, food,\" says Elvis Mendes.\\nThis part of Miami is home to many Cuban exiles, as well as people from all over Latin America. Some of them don\\'t have health insurance, while others are undocumented immigrants.\\n\\n                In their canvassing of a predominantly Cuban American neighborhood in October, Díaz (right) and another community outreach worker, María Elena González (left), spoke with Gloria Carvajal about how to get a COVID-19 test.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Verónica Zaragovia/WLRN\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nIn their canvassing of a predominantly Cuban American neighborhood in October, Díaz (right) and another community outreach worker, María Elena González (left), spoke with Gloria Carvajal about how to get a COVID-19 test.\\nSo Mendes and his team try to spread the word among residents here about programs like Ready Responders, a group of paramedics that now has foundation funding to give free coronavirus tests at home in areas like this one, regardless of immigration status.\\n\"Our mission is for all these people to get tested — regardless if they have a symptom or not — so we can diminish the level of people getting COVID-19,\" Mendes explains. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Protection, people who are infected but presymptomatic or asymptomatic account for more than 50% of transmissions.\\nThe Health Foundation of South Florida\\'s coronavirus-related grants have ranged from $35,000 to $160,000; other recipients include the South Florida chapter of the National Medical Association, Centro Campesino and the YMCA of South Florida.\\nThe foundation is focusing on low-income neighborhoods where some residents might not have access to a car, or be able to afford to pay for a coronavirus test at a pharmacy. Their focus includes residential areas near agriculture work sites. In Miami-Dade County, the foundation is working with county officials directly to increase testing. In nearby Broward County, the foundation is collaborating with public housing authorities to bring more testing into people\\'s homes.\\nIn Spanish, soothing fears about testing and offering free options \\nIt\\'s time-consuming to go door-to-door, but worthwhile: Residents respond when outreach teams speak their language and make a personal connection.\\nIn Little Havana, resident Gloria Carvajal told the outreach group that she felt anxious about whether the PCR test is painful.\\n\"What about that stick they put all the way up?\" Carvajal asked, laughing nervously.\\nMaría Elena González jumped in to reassure her that it\\'s not so bad: \"I\\'ve done it many times, because obviously we\\'re out and about in public and so we have to get the test done.\"\\n\\n                At a November memorial to lives lost to COVID-19 in the Liberty City neighborhood of Miami, Rev.

The church hosted a day of free testing back in October, with help from the foundation.\\n\"You know us. You know who we are,\" said the church\\'s pastor, Richard Dunn II. \"You know we wouldn\\'t allow anybody to do anything to hurt you.\"\\nDunn spoke recently in nearby Liberty City, a historically Black neighborhood, at an outdoor memorial service for Black residents who have died from COVID-19. To convey the magnitude of the community\\'s losses, hundreds of white plastic tombstones were set up behind the podium. They filled an entire field in the park.\\n\"Thousands upon thousands have died, and so we\\'re saying to the Lord here today, we\\'re not going to let their deaths be in vain,\" Dunn said.\\n\\n                A symbolic cemetery, in memory of neighborhood residents who have died from COVID-19, stands as a memorial in a field at Simonhoff Park in the Liberty City.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Verónica Zaragovia/WLRN\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nA symbolic cemetery, in memory of neighborhood residents who have died from COVID-19, stands as a memorial in a field at Simonhoff Park in the Liberty City.\\nDunn is also helping with a newly-launched effort to build trust in the COVID-19 vaccines among Black residents, by participating in online meetings during which Black church members can hear directly from Black medical experts. The message of the meetings is that the vaccines are safe and vital.\\n\"It\\'s taken over 300,000 lives in the United States of America,\" Dunn said at the end of the meeting. \"And I believe to do nothing would be more of a tragedy than to at least try to do something to prevent it and to stop the spreading of the coronavirus.\"\\nChurches will play a big role in the ongoing outreach efforts, and Dunn is committed to doing his part.

Protesters urged lawmakers to ban evictions for several months.\\nThe New York Legislature approved a sweeping eviction ban for tenants living in the state, giving residents fearful of losing their homes during the pandemic some relief at least until May.\\nThe law, which Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed late Monday, places a moratorium on residential evictions until May 1 for tenants who endured a \"COVID-related hardship.\" Tenants must show documentation explaining their situation to prevent evictions. Landlords can still evict people who don\\'t show that documentation.\\nThe law also stops residential foreclosure proceedings until May 1. Homeowners and landlords who own 10 or fewer residences can also file hardship declarations with their mortgage lender or a court to prevent a foreclosure. \\n\"When the COVID-19 pandemic began, we asked New Yorkers to protect each other by staying at home. As we fight our way through the marathon this pandemic has become, we need to make sure New Yorkers still have homes to provide that protection,\" Cuomo said after signing the bill.\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\'s nationwide temporary ban on residential evictions expires early next year. It was set to expire Dec. 31, but Congress extended that moratorium for another month in the latest coronavirus relief bill just signed by President Trump. Federal lawmakers also put $25 billion into rental assistance programs. \\nNew York, like many states in the country, is facing high rates of unemployment caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Tenant advocacy groups have protested for months, urging lawmakers to do more to prevent people from losing their homes.\\nA report by the National Council of State Housing Agencies earlier this year estimated U.S. renters will owe up to $34 billion in past-due rent by January. This is set to increase eviction filings and impose financial hardship on millions in just a few months, the organization said.\\nMany of those tenants struggling to pay rent in New York are in communities of color, according to Stanley Fritz, political director of Citizen Action of New York. He said in a statement Monday that Black and brown tenants are \"three to four times as likely to be facing eviction as their white counterparts.\"\\nHe said passing the eviction ban is an \"important first step\" to helping the 1.4 million tenant households behind on rent. \\nLandlord critics\\nThe long-term economic impact of unpaid rent for landlords has organizations representing building owners criticizing the new law. \\nJay Martin, executive director of the landlord group Community Housing Improvement Program, accused tenant advocates of having a broader political agenda by pushing the bill.\\nDays before the bill was signed, Martin tweeted that an eviction moratorium is just \"kicking the can down the road.\"\\nHe tweeted, \"Eviction moratoriums do not address the fundamental problem of the costs of housing. A problem for owners and renters.\"\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

Scott Applewhite/AP\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nElection cases are among those before the U.S. Supreme Court, though none that will change President Trump\\'s defeat.\\nIn January, the U.S. Supreme Court embarks on the second half of a term with a fortified 6-to-3 conservative majority. But unlike the first half of the term, there will be no norm-busting President Trump often railing at the court\\'s election decisions. In tone, President Biden probably will be the functional opposite, but his policies are likely to be greeted with more skepticism.\\nFor decades, the court\\'s five-justice conservative majority was split between those who wanted to move slowly in a more conservative direction and others who wanted to move more aggressively. But now, with the more centrist conservatives retired and three Trump appointees on the court, there is a conservative supermajority of six, meaning one vote to spare.\\nNo longer, as during the last term, does the reliably conservative but more incrementalist Chief Justice John Roberts have the controlling vote. The other five can now prevail without him.\\nBottom line: The current court may well turn out to be the most conservative since the 1930s.\\n\"On religion, abortion, gun rights and race, for example, there is a solid majority to change the law and ... move whip quick,\" says Supreme Court advocate and SCOTUSblog publisher Tom Goldstein.\\nObamacare and religion\\nAlready argued this term, but not decided yet, are two big cases. One tests whether the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, must be struck down entirely because one provision — the so-called mandate — was eliminated by Congress. But the law, including the mandate, has already been upheld twice before by the high court.\\nRepublicans in Congress have failed dozens of times to kill the ACA, even when they controlled the House, the Senate and the White House. In the meantime, Obamacare has become a very popular program, and if the court were to declare the entire law invalid at this late date, Republicans could end up in the position of a dog that chases the car for years and finally catches it. It could be bloody.\\nThe other case heard earlier this term tests whether the city of Philadelphia may refuse to award some foster care contracts to Catholic Social Services because CSS, based on religious objections, refuses to screen LGBT couples, as required by the city\\'s anti-discrimination laws.\\nThe tea leaves, as of now, indicate CSS will win. If so, the power of government to make contracts — the one area long viewed as relatively immune to religious challenges — would become fair game for religious objectors.\\nIt would be \"quite a significant departure from what the court might have done 15 or 20 years ago,\" observes professor Josh Blackman of South Texas College of Law Houston and co-author of An Introduction to Constitutional Law: 100 Supreme Court Cases Everyone Should Know.\\nA decision in favor of CSS would also be quite a departure from the court\\'s 1990 decision written by conservative icon Antonin Scalia. That 6-to-3 ruling declared that a valid and neutrally applied law is constitutional even if it has some incidental negative effects on some religious groups. As Scalia put it back then, allowing exceptions to every state law or regulation affecting religion \"would open the prospect of constitutionally required religious exemptions from civic obligations of almost every conceivable kind.\"\\nStill, the current court appears headed in the direction that Scalia warned against. Indeed, even before the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, there was a firm conservative majority in religious liberty cases.\\nThe only religious liberty case in which Chief Justice Roberts split with fellow conservatives involved the public health measures that governors have taken during the pandemic. Early on, Roberts sided with the liberals in allowing governors to limit attendance at religious services in order to curb the spread of the coronavirus. But that was before the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\\nIn what could be a harbinger of things to come, Roberts\\' vote became irrelevant after Barrett joined the court and provided a fifth vote against Gov. Andrew Cuomo\\'s actions in New York. Similar orders limiting church and synagogue attendance were soon struck down.\\nExecutive power\\nOn a different question, the executive power of the presidency, the Supreme Court\\'s conservative majority has generally deferred to Trump\\'s muscular assertions of presidential power. So, will the conservative court majority be similarly deferential to Biden?\\n\"I think the short answer is no,\" says University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck. \"Some of that is going to reflect ... the fact that the court will be more suspicious and skeptical of some of the policies that the Biden administration attempts to pursue by executive order.\"\\nSCOTUSblog\\'s Goldstein agrees, noting that \"historically, the Supreme Court\\'s view about whether a president has powers [to do certain things] has tended to track whether the justices in the majority like the president and his policies.\" Goldstein adds that it will be \"really fascinating\" to see whether a court that has \"breathed more life\" into presidential powers \"will stick with that even if they don\\'t like the policies of a much more liberal president.\"\\nBoth Goldstein and Vladeck note, however, that the conservative majority has been cutting back on the regulatory power of administrative agencies to carry out objectives spelled out in legislation. That trend, they observe, is likely to increase, making it more difficult for agencies to make rules carrying out everything from environmental to consumer protection laws.\\n\"This term is like an iceberg,\" says Goldstein. \"There are big cases above the surface,\" like the ACA case. But below the surface, there are cases being pushed by big business that could make it hard for \"the little guy\" to go to court and harder for agencies to enact regulations. If big business prevails, he maintains, \"it\\'ll be an earthquake\" in terms of consequences.\\nAbortion and guns\\nOn the hot-button issues of abortion, guns and race, the court\\'s conservative majority is most likely to start moving aggressively next term and thereafter.\\nWill Roe v. Wade, the court\\'s 47-year-old abortion rights precedent, be overturned? There are two schools of thought on that. One is that the court will systematically hollow out the right to abortion so that it is a right on paper only.\\nThe other school of thought is that leaving Roe a shell is not enough for those opposed to abortion. \"There is, I think, a galvanizing view within the pro-life movement that the time has come to call the question,\" observes New York University law professor Melissa Murray.\\nIf Roe is to be overturned, however, it likely will take more than a year or two to come to fruition. Former Obama-era Solicitor General Donald Verrilli has said that he thinks it likely will happen within five years or so.\\nOn guns, though, the court looks — for the first time — to have a clear majority that is hostile to gun regulation. Last term, the court once again punted, and punted again on the issue, declining to hear 10 gun-rights cases. Presumably, Chief Justice Roberts\\' then-deciding vote was still in doubt.\\nBut now, with Barrett newly on the court and Ginsburg gone, there appear to be five conservative votes ready to march down the path of expansive gun rights, and Second Amendment activists are teeing up new cases.\\n\"I can tell you people are getting more aggressive,\" says professor Blackman, a gun-rights advocate. Gun-rights groups \"are emboldened to try to push new frontiers\" now.\\nElection cases and race plus affirmative action\\nElection cases are also before the court, though none that will undo Trump\\'s defeat. But, left over from Trump\\'s fight, there is a possible case from Pennsylvania testing whether state supreme courts have the authority to interpret state laws and state constitutions in federal elections. The justices declined to review the case prior to the election — and affected ballots, relatively few in number, would not have changed the outcome. But the justices may yet agree to hear the case to resolve the issue.\\nAlso on the docket are cases involving state laws that make it more difficult to vote. In 2013, the high court struck down a key part of the Voting Rights Act. Roberts confidently wrote, \"Our country has changed,\" and he said that the protections in the law were no longer needed. Within days, though, Republican-dominated state legislatures in the South began writing new laws that made it, once again, more difficult to vote, and they started redrawing legislative lines to further limit minority influence in state and federal legislatures.\\nSo, will that reality on the ground have any influence in the current voting rights cases before the court? No, say voting rights experts.\\nUT\\'s Vladeck says that while the current court did hold the line against Trump\\'s post-election attempts to change the outcome, the court\\'s conservatives believe states should be free to enact pre-election laws that restrict early voting and voting by mail, while at the same time allowing states to purge voting roles and tighten voter ID requirements. The conservative majority does not see such restrictions as aimed at intentionally stacking the deck against poor and minority voters.\\n\"For the chief justice and easily a majority of this conservative Supreme Court, their views about race are fully baked,\" says SCOTUSblog\\'s Goldstein.\\nIn the same vein, by next term the court will likely hear arguments in one of several cases testing affirmative action in higher-education admissions. The court, for a half-century, has repeatedly ruled that some consideration of race in college admissions is permissible, but a racial quota is not.\\nBut now, there may well be a conservative majority to reverse those rulings and bar all consideration of racial diversity in college admissions. After that, affirmative action in employment could be next.\\nIn the coming year, other key developments also could shape the Supreme Court\\'s future.\\nRetirements on the horizon?\\nEighty-two-year-old Justice Stephen Breyer, one of the court\\'s three remaining liberals, could step down. But he may feel constrained by the fact that Republicans currently control the U.S. Senate, and GOP leader Mitch McConnell has never hesitated to use his power as Senate majority leader to block or advance Supreme Court nominees based solely on whether the nominating president is a fellow Republican or a Democrat.\\nSo, Breyer might stay his hand. If, however, the Democrats win two Senate seats in Georgia in January, giving Democrats the upper hand in the Senate for the first time in 10 years, Breyer may well pull the trigger on retirement.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

About $23 million of that went to seven hotels, in cities including Chicago, Boston, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, where the union represents more than 1,000 housekeepers, servers and other service workers.\\nIn its application to the Small Business Administration, the Omni Providence Hotel in Rhode Island asked for a $2.6 million PPP loan, promising to retain 246 jobs.\\nQuilcia Moronta, a health club attendant, was laid off after working at the hotel for 21 years. She applied for unemployment benefits and food stamps and was hopeful when the hotel\\'s loan was approved on April 13.\\n\"As I was struggling to provide for my family, I learned that the Omni had received some PPP money,\" said Moronta, a single mother with two children. \"I said, \\'Great, at least they\\'re gonna help us get by when it comes to basic needs.\\' \"\\nEight months later, unemployment benefits for Moronta and other workers have expired, and health coverage is long gone. And they are still waiting for PPP benefits.\\n\"Right now, here we are in December, and we haven\\'t heard anything about Omni using that money to help their employees,\" she said.\\n\"Here in Boston, I\\'ve spoken to hundreds of workers who work at the Omni Parker House, and I know none of them have received a single dime of this money,\" said Carlos Aramayo, Unite Here\\'s executive vice president. \"Looking at this winter, a lot of them could really use it.\"\\nZebedee Williams was laid off in March from his job as an overnight banquet houseman at the Omni William Penn Hotel in Pittsburgh. He said that since unemployment benefits and weekly supplemental assistance from the federal government ran out, he has struggled to feed his household, which includes a partner on disability and three daughters. To stretch the budget, he said, he has skipped meals.\\n\"It\\'s not right for the kids not to eat,\" Williams said. \"I would do it 10 times again if the situation happened. I would make sure my children eat. I would make do.\"\\nIn a written statement, a spokesperson for the Dallas-based chain said workers at the hotels had not been retained because the facilities were either closed or operating at greatly reduced capacity.\\nPPP was part of the CARES Act, the huge pandemic-relief package President Trump signed in March. Some 5.2 million businesses have secured $523 billion in PPP loans. Though the Small Business Administration program was meant to help small businesses keep workers paid — as an alternative to unemployment — it has been widely criticized for favoring large businesses and been stung with allegations of fraud.\\nPPP rules do permit a business to use funds for payroll even if it is closed. But the Omni elected not to do that. Instead, the chain said in its statement, \"any amount of the PPP loans that are not forgiven will be returned or repaid with interest per program terms.\"\\n\\n                Quilcia Moronta (right), who was laid off from the Omni Providence Hotel last spring, with her children, Gabriela and Gabriel.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Quilcia Moronta\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nQuilcia Moronta (right), who was laid off from the Omni Providence Hotel last spring, with her children, Gabriela and Gabriel.\\nCritics say whether the hotels pay back the loans is beside the point. They note, for instance, that the interest rate on PPP loans is just 1% — well below market rate.\\n\"It\\'s disgusting if companies want to use this as a way to get a low-interest loan from the federal government,\" says Unite Here\\'s Aramayo. \"It\\'s really not fair for a company to take money that was intended to help out their own workforce and use it for some other purpose.\"\\nOmni\\'s use of the funds is \"obviously really contravening the spirit of what this [program] was about,\" said Harry J. Van Buren, a professor of business ethics at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minn. \"Even if they do repay the loan, the fact that they got awfully close to free money for some period of time is really an advantage to them as well.\"\\n\"I do think about other businesses that maybe didn\\'t get money because Omni did, either truly small businesses that were struggling or another company that might have used it to actually pay their workers,\" said Lisa Gilbert, executive vice president of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. \"It doesn\\'t seem like a great investment of taxpayer dollars, even if they pay back the money at the end of the day.\"\\nOn Dec. 8, Aramayo wrote to the Small Business Administration and the Treasury Department, urging them to scrutinize PPP loans to Omni hotels, \"especially if [the borrowers] apply for forgiveness.\" It was just weeks before Trump signed into law a new pandemic-relief package with its own version of the Paycheck Protection Program — one with new rules to help address some of the problems critics found with the first iteration.\\nAn earlier version of this story said the University of St. Thomas was in Minneapolis.

And despite fundraising advantages almost everywhere, their efforts to take back a number of state legislatures fizzled. \\n\"It\\'s pretty unique that you don\\'t pick up down ballot when you have such a resounding success at the top of the ticket,\" said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake.\\nThat\\'s the big mystery of this election: Why the disparity between Biden\\'s decisive win and Democrats\\' disappointing down-ballot performance?\\nUsually the party that loses the White House conducts a self-examination to figure out what went wrong and how it can do better next time. But as Trump continues to falsely claim he didn\\'t lose, and as many Republicans are feeling triumphant that the trouncing they expected didn\\'t materialize, it\\'s the Democrats trying to figure out what happened. The results are offering the party five possible lessons.\\n1. Ticket-splitting isn\\'t totally extinct\\nThe simplest explanation for Democrats\\' down-ballot disappointment is that many voters split their tickets. They rejected Trump but didn\\'t embrace the Democrats. Data suggests there wasn\\'t much ticket-splitting, but there may have been just enough to help Republicans in just the right places.\\n\\n                Many Maine voters split their tickets, as Biden won the state easily, but Republican Sen. Susan Collins also won reelection handily.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Robert F. Bukaty/AP\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nMany Maine voters split their tickets, as Biden won the state easily, but Republican Sen. Susan Collins also won reelection handily.\\nDespite years of gridlock in Washington, some voters still like the checks and balances of divided government, according to Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist in South Carolina.\\n\"I\\'ve talked to a number of people who said they want to send a message to Donald Trump, but they also want to send a message about what they felt like was working for them locally,\" he said. \"They knew how to separate the national from the local in this election cycle. It did not work out as well for us.\"\\nA lot of the congressional districts the Democrats lost this year were districts Trump won, but they also lost eight districts where Biden won.\\n\"Six of those districts that we lost are majority people of color districts,\" said Chuck Rocha, a Democratic strategist who advised Bernie Sanders during the primary. \"These are all majority Latino, Black and Asian seats that we lost, when that used to be the backbone of what the Democratic Party was.\"\\nRocha points out that there was one big exception: Arizona. That\\'s where the next lesson may lie.\\n2. Democrats\\' lagging support with Latinos could have been prevented\\nBiden won Arizona with a big majority of Latino voters. Democrats picked up a Senate seat, lost no House seats, and they even picked up one seat in the state legislature. \\nRocha says that\\'s because Democrats did things in Arizona that they neglected to do in other states with large Latino populations, like Florida, California or Texas.\\n\\n                Biden won Arizona\\'s Maricopa County, helping to flip the state to Democrats in the presidential race.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Matt York/AP\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nBiden won Arizona\\'s Maricopa County, helping to flip the state to Democrats in the presidential race.\\n\"You need a candidate who makes a commitment to talk to our community early and often,\" he said. \"So Joe Biden goes up [on television] there in the end of June and spends millions of dollars on Spanish-language communications and never comes off the air.\"\\nThere were also a number of Latino political organizations in Arizona telling voters — in Spanish — why they should be voting for Biden.\\n\"TV, radio, digital, mail — robust infrastructure on the ground with people talking to people from the community to the community, like LUCHA, like Mi Familia Vota. Arizona is one of the only states that had all three components all year long,\" Rocha said. \\n3. A bigger, more diverse electorate isn\\'t a slam dunk for Democrats\\nThis election belied two core political assumptions for Democrats. The first is that as the electorate gets more diverse, Democrats automatically do better. Not so fast.\\n\"There are a lot of Democrats who believe demography is destiny, and that\\'s true and nice if you\\'ve got 50 years. But if you\\'ve got six months or 18 months, demography is not destiny yet,\" pollster Lake said. \"This is not a sea change; this is a glacial change.\"\\nThe second bit of conventional wisdom punctured this year is that high turnout helps Democrats.\\n\"Universally, high turnout does not help the Democrats,\" Lake said. \"It depends on who\\'s turning out.\"\\nRepublicans — at least when Trump is on the ballot — were a lot better at getting their voters out than Democrats expected, with the \"blue wave\" of the 2018 midterms failing to wash ashore again this year. It\\'s similar to the pattern of Barack Obama\\'s presidency, when Democrats turned out big in presidential years, but Republicans dominated in the midterms.\\n4. Simplify the message\\nDemocrats say they also need a way to fight back when Republicans brand them as dangerous \"socialists\" who want to \"defund the police.\" Only a small handful of progressive candidates were actually in favor of defunding the police. A majority of House Democrats, along with Biden, rejected that slogan, but they couldn\\'t stop it from being weaponized against all of them.\\nThat failure, says Rocha, is on the Democrats.\\n\"There\\'s no way that that helps you,\" he said. \"There\\'s just such a better way to get in front of that. Black men are being killed in the street by cops and we are filming it, and we can\\'t think of the right way to say that that has to change? It\\'s just — it\\'s disgusting that we would let that happen.\"\\nMany Democrats admit they need a simpler, more populist message on the economy, starting with policies that have broad bipartisan support, like infrastructure, debt-free college and a $15-per-hour minimum wage, which 61% of Florida voters approved in November as Trump won their state by 3 points.\\n\"Donald Trump, he put his policy on the front of a red hat. That\\'s how he did it,\" Rocha said. \"Like, we\\'ve got to get a lot more simplistic about our messaging and bring it way back down to where working-class people can understand who\\'s with them and who\\'s against them.\" \\nThe key for Democrats, he thinks, is an economic message that speaks to both non-college-educated white voters and people of color, and that can help Democrats expand their appeal geographically.\\n5. The cities and suburbs are not enough\\nSuburbs are the new battleground, and Democrats did do very well in them. But for Democrats to achieve a true governing majority, they need a broader geographic reach.\\n\"We should take a lot of lessons from how Joe Biden put together a winning coalition, and we have to expand that, particularly in more exurban and rural areas,\" said Mark Riddle, a Democratic strategist who runs the Future Majority PAC. \"There are parts of our country that see things differently, and we have to have a larger conversation with them in order to get more seats.\"\\nThe challenges of taking office without a clear governing majority may become apparent very quickly, and overcoming them presents Biden and his party with a lot of familiar hurdles.\\n\"If you\\'re looking at 2022, we\\'re going to have to win in Wisconsin. We have to win in Pennsylvania again. We\\'re gonna have to win in Michigan,\" Riddle said. \"It\\'s the same battleground.\"\\nExcept next time, Democrats won\\'t have Trump to run against the way they did so successfully in 2018. Typically, the incumbent president\\'s party loses seats in Congress during the midterms.\\nSo with all the other lessons, Democrats are going to have to figure out how to defy history over the next two years if they want to turn a demographic majority into a political majority that\\'s big enough to actually govern in Washington.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

It allows a company to go public without all the paperwork of a traditional initial public offering. Above, the Charging Bull statue in New York City\\'s Financial District.\\nThis year, the hottest trend on Wall Street could be summed up in one strange and unfamiliar word: SPAC.\\nShaquille O\\'Neal\\'s got a SPAC. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan\\'s got a SPAC. Famed investor Bill Ackman launched a $4 billion SPAC. And a 25-year-old became the youngest self-made billionaire thanks to — you guessed it — a SPAC.\\nSo what is a SPAC? A \"special purpose acquisition company\" is a way for a company to go public without all the paperwork of a traditional IPO, or initial public offering.\\nIn an IPO, a company announces it wants to go public, then discloses a lot of details about its business operations. After that, investors put money into the company in exchange for shares.\\nA SPAC flips that process around. Investors pool their money together first, with no idea what company they\\'re investing in. The SPAC goes public as a shell company. The required disclosures are easier than those for a regular IPO, because a pile of money doesn\\'t have any business operations to describe.\\nThen, generally, the SPAC goes out and looks for a real company that wants to go public, and they merge together. The company gets the stock ticker and the pile of money much more quickly than through a normal IPO.\\nThe investors now own stock in a real company, not just a shell company. And the sponsor who put the work into organizing the SPAC gets a big chunk of the company as a reward.\\nFor the last two decades, SPACs have existed on the fringes of the financial world.\\n\"They have this sort of shady origin story,\" says Usha Rodrigues, a professor at the University of Georgia School of Law.\\nToday\\'s SPACs are descended from the \"blank-check corporations\" of the 1980s, which \"really had a bad reputation,\" Rodrigues says.\\nThey were so infamous for scamming investors that a federal law was passed to crack down on them.\\nAlong the way, the blank-check model was reinvented as a SPAC, with crucial safeguards for investors. For instance, if an investor didn\\'t approve of the company a SPAC sponsor chose to merge with, the investor could get his or her money back, plus interest.\\nBut SPACs remained unpopular. Until now.\\n Loading... \\nIPOs, mergers and acquisitions, and deal-making in general are all up sharply right now — no wonder, as the stock market is currently booming.\\nBut SPACs, specifically, are surging like nothing else. SPAC launches have quadrupled since last year, and an astonishing number of SPAC combinations (the transactions that actually take a company public) have been announced.\\n\"I\\'ve probably done, you know, one or two SPAC combinations a year for the last five years — until this year,\" says Sarah Morgan, a lawyer with the large energy-focused law firm Vinson & Elkins. \"This year the market just exploded. [SPACs] are over 50% of my practice this year.\"\\nSPACs are sparking new attention in part because their built-in advantages — speed, control and less uncertainty for founders who want to go public — are particularly appealing in a year marked by volatility.\\nAustin Russell is the CEO of Luminar, a company that makes lidar — technology that detects surrounding objects, sort of like radar but using lasers — for self-driving vehicles.\\nHe founded the company as a teenager, and now Luminar has contracts with companies like Volvo.\\nIt was time to go public. Russell said that \"mechanically and financially,\" a SPAC just made sense — and you can\\'t argue with the speed.\\n\"You got through the process end to end in, you know, like four months, as opposed to having to spend huge time and distraction for the better part of a year or two,\" he says.\\nBut Russell didn\\'t agree to a SPAC until he\\'d seen several other \"very legitimate\" companies go public through the process.\\nThat\\'s another key element in the meteoric rise of SPACs: After high-profile, well-regarded companies and investors started getting involved in SPACs, other people were more willing to give it a shot.\\nAs Russell put it, a SPAC is now \"pretty cool.\"\\nRussell completed his company\\'s SPAC merger this month — a transaction that made him Forbes\\' youngest self-made billionaire.\\nSPACS can also mean big bucks for the sponsors who organize them, who are rewarded with a big chunk of equity when they close a deal. In fact, sponsors can make so much money if they complete a SPAC that some critics worry there\\'s an incentive to merge with a mediocre company just to get their payday.\\nAnd that raises a big question: whether this SPAC craze will be good for investors. The stock market is booming now, and SPACs are a boom within a boom, but will that actually lead to returns?\\nSome of this year\\'s SPACs have performed badly on the stock market, and others have raised bigger concerns.\\nAfter zero-emission truck-maker Nikola went public through a SPAC, it was accused of fraud, which the company denies.\\nToday\\'s SPACs are much safer investments than the fraudulent blank-check companies of the \\'80s, says Rodrigues, but the same streamlined, speedy process that appeals to founders could increase the perils for investors.\\n\"The flip side of making things easier for companies is inevitably that the risk of fraud to investors goes up,\" she says. \"I don\\'t know any way to square that circle.\"\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

Opposition has come from Hollywood stars, state attorneys general and local residents who worry about the danger this poses.  But plans are moving ahead for a New Jersey project that calls for one of the longest such transport routes in the country: 200 miles through densely populated areas of the East Coast. \\nThe gas from Pennsylvania\\'s Marcellus Shale would first be sent by pipeline to a new liquefaction plant in the rural northeast part of the state. Refrigeration units would chill it to negative-260 degrees Fahrenheit, at which point it becomes liquid and easier to ship. The part of the plan that scares a lot of people is the next step — transporting the gas by truck or rail down the busy I-95 corridor to a planned export terminal along the Delaware River in Gloucester County, New Jersey.\\n\"That terrifies me,\" says Vanessa Keegan, who lives nearby with her family, including her three-year-old son Theo.  She points to where rail cars full of highly flammable liquefied natural gas — or LNG — would roll about a block and a half away from her house. \"That train track that you could skip on down to in about a minute and a half.\"\\nA daycare center sits right next to the gate of the planned export terminal. \\nPipelines are the more common way to move gas long distances, but battles over them have delayed or even scrapped some projects. Trucks are also allowed to transport LNG. But using rail cars in densely populated areas had been limited until the new rule took effect in August. \\nEven before that, Delaware River Partners, a subsidiary of New Fortress Energy, which has ties to President Trump, secured a special federal permit to move the LNG by rail. It allows two 100-car trains to transport the gas each day. \\n\\n                Homes next to train tracks in Gibbstown, NJ, where up to 200 rail cars a day will be allowed to carry liquefied natural gas to an export terminal.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Emma Lee/WHYY\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nHomes next to train tracks in Gibbstown, NJ, where up to 200 rail cars a day will be allowed to carry liquefied natural gas to an export terminal.\\nIn this rust-belt region of New Jersey the project does have support, including from building trade unions and powerful state lawmakers. State Assemblyman John Burzichelli says his grandfather worked at a shuttered DuPont dynamite plant that will house the planned LNG export terminal. \\n\"That site will create jobs as it once did, contribute to the tax base as it once did, and be an important economic driver for people to make a living and feed their families,\" says Burzichelli.\\nHe says safety issues should be addressed, but that rail cars carry much more hazardous materials through the region every day.  \"The history of moving this stuff is pretty sound,\" he says.\\nThe new rule does require rail cars to be built with a thicker outer tank than is mandated for other hazardous cryogenic liquids like ethylene and ethane. (Although it\\'s unclear if that applies to projects like this one, greenlighted earlier through a special permit.)\\nRay Mentzer, a chemical engineer at Purdue University, spent his career working on LNG projects for Exxon Mobil. He says the specially designed containers that transport hydrocarbons have a good safety record. But he says transporting the gas through densely populated areas increases the risk if there\\'s a leak.\\n\"It\\'s not flammable until it\\'s vaporized, but it\\'s going to be vaporized pretty darn quickly and then it\\'s going to seek an ignition source,\" he says. \"Believe me, it will find an ignition source pretty darn readily.\"\\nThe developers of the New Jersey export project — New Fortress Energy and Delaware River Partners — did not respond to multiple requests for an interview, and would not confirm details of their plans.\\nRail companies lobbied for the rule and downplay the potential for accidents. \\nEarlier this year, Ian Jefferies, CEO of the Association of American Railroads, told NPR \"the track record speaks for itself: 99.99% of all hazmat moved by rail reaches its destination without any incident whatsoever.\" He also said industry uses \"risk-based routing analysis to ensure that railroads are using the lowest risk routes.\"\\nFifteen state Attorneys General, including those in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware, have challenged the move saying it put people\\'s lives at risk. \\n\"We\\'re going to court because our families expect our government to put their safety first, not put them in harm\\'s way,\" said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra in a statement. Becerra is now president-elect Joe Biden\\'s nominee for Health and Human Services Secretary.\\nDespite joining that suit, New Jersey recently signed off on construction of a dock for the LNG export project, although N.J. Governor Phil Murphy says the state \"will explore all avenues within its authority to prevent the use of this dock for LNG transport.\"\\nThe Delaware Riverkeeper Network has challenged a number of state and federal permits for the project, saying a thorough Environmental Impact Statement was never done. \\n\"The Biden Administration could step in and set a policy that this project, and all other LNG export projects, require comprehensive environmental review,\" says the network\\'s deputy director Tracy Carluccio.\\nStanding on her porch along the route to the planned export terminal, Vanessa Keegan worries that transporting LNG by rail is untested. \"If an accident happens,\" she says, \"we don\\'t get to show up the next day and say, \\'Look, I told you so.\\'\"\\nShe also thinks fossil fuel projects like this should be abandoned in favor of renewables like wind or solar. \\nIn fact, if the export facility gets built, none of the gas traveling through the area will go to power New Jersey homes. The state is planning a large offshore wind farm to help reach its goal of using all clean energy by 2050. \\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

Mann was one of the residents who died of COVID-19 this year when there was an outbreak at the facility.\\nOn the evening of Feb. 20 at an assisted living facility just on the edge of southwest Atlanta, Ernestine Mann stood in front of her peers to read aloud a proclamation commemorating Black History Month. She was dressed for the occasion: delicate earrings and a flowy blouse with a little hint of shimmer.\\n\"Good evening everyone,\" Mann said as her daughter Karla McKinney filmed. \"This is my first year living here, and I\\'m having a great time.\"\\nMann moved into this facility, Arbor Terrace at Cascade, in August 2019 and quickly became a prominent community member. She was a leader in a group tasked with welcoming newcomers; once, she\\'d greeted a woman who was deaf by seamlessly switching to American Sign Language, a skill she\\'d learned years earlier. \\n\"She was not over there wasting away,\" McKinney said. \"She wasn\\'t the resident that just kind of showed up for the dining hall and then just stayed in her room. She had a really nice social life.\"\\nThat particular night in February, Mann was standing before her new neighbors, reading a document celebrating \"the remarkable accomplishments and lasting impact of our country\\'s great African American leaders and citizens.\" \\nIt was fitting she would read this particular proclamation to this particular group. Many of the residents fit that description. There was Bernice Foster, known for her musical talent; Dr. Delutha King, co-founder of the Sickle Cell Foundation of Georgia, and his wife, Lois King; Blanche and Eddie Johnson Jr., married for 63 years; Edgar Lewis, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel; and, of course, Mann herself, a teacher for three decades.\\nIn a little more than two months, all of them would die from COVID-19. \\n\\n                Siblings Karla McKinney and Bill Mann last saw their mother, Ernestine Mann, alive on March 25 through a window visit after the facility started restricting visitors.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Lynsey Weatherspoon for NPR\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nSiblings Karla McKinney and Bill Mann last saw their mother, Ernestine Mann, alive on March 25 through a window visit after the facility started restricting visitors.\\nIn all, at least 17 residents died, 54 residents tested positive, and 36 staff tested positive.

There\\'s another key difference between this Arbor Terrace and the others: In Georgia, it is the company\\'s only facility in a predominantly Black neighborhood. That has left the families of the dead to wonder what exactly went wrong and whether racism played a role.\\nNPR looked into what happened at Arbor Terrace at Cascade to try to answer that question. Through government records and interviews with families, residents, and former staff, a more complete picture of the outbreak emerged. The Arbor Co. left Cascade residents and staff inadequately protected at a crucial moment, and this particular facility could not afford missteps. Systemic factors — including its location in Atlanta and its particularly vulnerable population — made this place both more susceptible and more vulnerable to the virus and, perhaps, its staff less equipped to respond.\\nThe result reflects a grim national pattern that has endured throughout the pandemic\\'s many months: Black Americans are getting and dying from COVID-19 at higher rates than white Americans. The outbreak at Arbor Terrace at Cascade offers a glimpse into factors that contribute to that disparity at a place where some of the families did not expect it to play out. \\n\"Even though you achieved all these things, at the end of your life, you are in essence, and I hate to say this, you were in some COVID-infested center,\" said Tricia Johnson, the daughter of a resident who tested positive but survived. \"I mean, their brand has definitely been tarnished, but it doesn\\'t appear it\\'s going to be tarnished in the white areas.\"\\n\"The crème de la crème\"\\nArbor Terrace at Cascade is just off Cascade Road, a major thoroughfare in southwest Atlanta. A tall grove of trees shields the building from the main road, making it feel apart from the bustle of the nearby Home Depot and Walmart. Its colonial revival facade is homey: red brick and pale yellow siding with slate-colored shutters.\\nThe area around the facility is simply known as Cascade, and the neighborhood has had its share of notable residents over the years: former Atlanta mayors, baseball legend Hank Aaron and John Lewis, the late civil rights leader and congressman. But until the mid-1960s, much of the area was white.\\n\\n                Cascade is a predominantly Black middle-class neighborhood of Atlanta.

Gary Dean, senior pastor at Hoosier Memorial United Methodist Church, located near Cascade Road. \"Of course the whites, they left, and the community became basically all Black.\"\\nAfter Arbor Terrace at Cascade opened in 1999, it came to mirror its surroundings. The Black movers and shakers of Atlanta moved in. Talk to people who have worked there, and they\\'ll tell you stories of doctors, lawyers, teachers, city planners, a Tuskegee Airman. Marcus Davis, a former maintenance director at the facility, said living in the Cascade area was a \"badge of honor\" and that Arbor Terrace at Cascade, where it was common to pay more than $4,000 per month for an apartment, became a \"status symbol.\"\\n\"It was like being at grandma and grandpa\\'s house every day. You had some of the most intelligent, sweet, kind, loving people,\" Davis said. \"A lot of the people who resided at Arbor Terrace at Cascade were intricate parts of Black history throughout Atlanta and throughout the United States.\"\\nWhen the National Center for Civil and Human Rights opened in Atlanta in 2014, Davis said they took a group from the facility to the museum. He listened to the residents swap stories from the civil rights movement.\\n\"They were firsthand accounts,\" he said. \"Oh my God, it was unbelievable.\"\\nWhen Mann\\'s family was searching for a facility, her daughter Karla McKinney said they landed on Arbor Terrace in part because it was near where her mother had lived, and because she already had friends there. \\n\"It was looked upon as one of the crème de la crème of assisted living facilities,\" McKinney said.\\n\\'\\'If I knew what I know now, I could have just lost my job\"\\nIn the weeks leading up to the first highly publicized outbreaks in the U.S., Jazmine Heggins, a former resident assistant who worked at the facility at the time, remembers feeling like some employees weren\\'t as worried as they should have been.\\n\"It kind of was like, \\'Oh, that\\'s not going to make it to the United States. We\\'re not going to have anything to worry about.\\' It was kind of just like something that was made up almost,\" she said. \\n\\n                Arbor Terrace at Cascade is the Arbor Co.\\'s only facility in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Georgia.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Lynsey Weatherspoon for NPR\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nArbor Terrace at Cascade is the Arbor Co.\\'s only facility in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Georgia.\\nBut then, Heggins said, staff and residents started to get sick with something. And by late March, she did, too.\\nShe woke up exhausted on a Friday morning. By Sunday, she had aches and a sore throat. She later wrote on her blog that \"it was as if someone had beaten me with a baseball bat overnight.\"\\nHeggins told NPR that she reached out to work, saying she thought she had caught something from the residents. The staff member who replied said she couldn\\'t call in sick and should tough it out.\\nHeggins said she felt confused: The company had explicitly told them not to come into work if they felt sick. That was in line with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance. But now she was being told to come in. \\n\"It was like they were telling us one thing, but then they really meant, like, it doesn\\'t actually matter. We just have to tell you this,\" Heggins told NPR. A few hours after she got to work, she said she developed a fever. At that point, she said, she was allowed to go home.\\nWhile Heggins was out, she said she started getting phone calls from coworkers, telling her about the residents who died.\\n\"It was like someone calling you and telling you, \\'Hey, your grandma just passed away, and you may have given them COVID and they just passed away,\\' but it was over and over again,\" Heggins said. \"Everybody that you take care of every day, say good night to and tuck in to sleep and wake them up in the morning, they\\'re dead now.\"\\nShe said she eventually asked them to stop calling. \\n\"I was going to sleep crying every night. It was just too much,\" she said. \"I was potentially going to lose my job, but if I knew what I know now, I could have just lost my job.\"\\nAnother former staff member, who asked not to be named, said other coworkers also felt pressured to come to work and that leadership at the facility told them they couldn\\'t go home if they didn\\'t have a fever, even if they were showing other symptoms.\\n\"Just as simple as that,\" the staff member said. \"Most likely you\\'re getting fired.\"\\nThat person also remembers working while symptomatic. One day sticks out in particular, when six or seven residents fell ill at the same time. \\n\"They were throwing up. They were extremely weak. They were having diarrhea. People were clammy and we\\'re trying to get them going to the hospital,\" the staff member said. \"I just remember sitting down telling my other coworker, \\'I can\\'t make it through the day.\\' I said, \\'Something\\'s wrong with me and I\\'m not feeling well.\\' My whole body was aching and it\\'s all of my strength just to make it through that day.\"\\nIn a statement to NPR, Judd Harper, president of the Arbor Co., said: \"Before the pandemic, Arbor Terrace at Cascade had policies, practices, and procedures, which instructed staff not to come to work with illnesses or physical conditions that may pose a risk to their or others\\' health and safety. During the pandemic, we re-emphasized that policy and reminded staff of the policy in daily huddles starting on March 3, 2020.\"\\nAccording to Harper, Arbor Terrace at Cascade also took the staff\\'s temperature and had them change clothes when coming to work, and tracked the symptoms of staff who were sick. Harper also told NPR the company paid for coronavirus testing for staff, increased their paid time off, provided hourly bonuses to healthy employees, and provided financial assistance for child care, among other initiatives. \\n\\'\\'She didn\\'t have to go this way\\'\\'\\nMarch 25 was the last day McKinney and Bill Mann saw their mother alive. Arbor Terrace at Cascade began restricting visitors on March 12, but by the end of the month, they were allowing window visits. The family came wearing masks and gloves.\\n\"As we were watching and waiting for my mom to come to the window, we could see her coming across the lobby and she was toddling like a baby just beginning to walk,\" McKinney said. The family knew then that something was off, McKinney said, but tried to stay cheerful. \\n\"She was able to talk but, see, if you knew her, [when] my mom spoke, she spoke strong,\" Bill Mann said. \"This particular time she sounded extremely weak. It was almost to a whisper, and that\\'s just not like her.\"\\nTheir mom seemed dazed. Her eyes were darting around as if she just couldn\\'t fix her gaze on anyone. She had trouble recognizing her granddaughter. \\n\"We ended up not staying as long as we thought we might have because she clearly was tired and something wasn\\'t right,\" McKinney said. \"When we did get ready to go, she stood up and she stumbled.\"\\n\\n                Marian Hatch, a former resident at Arbor Terrace at Cascade, looks at one of the photos of her friends.

And the staff agreed that something was wrong. Mann had been having bouts of diarrhea. They called an ambulance. Marian Hatch, one of Mann\\'s closest friends at the facility, watched as her friend was taken away.\\n\"I saw her. I think I knew she was sick,\" Hatch, who is 92 and tested positive but survived, told NPR. \"The very last time that I saw Ernestine, when she was on the gurney, when she was in the hall waiting to be carried away, I didn\\'t go over to her. I waved at her.\"\\nAt Piedmont Atlanta Hospital, Mann was first diagnosed with pneumonia. \\n\"Once she got to the hospital, you know, we\\'re blowing up the hospital [with calls] trying to find out what is going on,\" Bill Mann said.\\nHer coronavirus test came back positive on March 27. She was placed on oxygen. On March 28, she seemed to be doing better. But by the next day, she had taken a turn for the worst. That morning, a doctor called, saying Mann was agitated and pulling at her oxygen mask. The hospital staff wanted to see if the family could calm her down over the phone.\\n\"I still try very hard to get the sound of her voice out of my mind, even to this day. She said, \\'Come help me, help me, help me, you all, please come help me,\\' \" McKinney remembered. The family couldn\\'t visit, because of COVID-19 restrictions. \\n\"To hear her crying out for help, to know that I couldn\\'t get there, it\\'s just been very emotional for me to have that memory of her,\" McKinney said. \"And now, learning more about COVID victims, they seem to feel like they\\'re drowning. That\\'s what I\\'m told. And just having that thought that my mom was in that predicament, it\\'s just really hard.\"\\nBill Mann remembers praying with his mom. Afterward, he said she seemed more at peace. \"After the prayer she said, \\'Thank you so much, I really needed that,\\' \" he recalled.\\nA doctor called again later that day, asking about end-of-life decisions, and whether or not they would want to resuscitate.\\n\\n                McKinney last saw her mother alive on March 25. She noticed something was off when her mom appeared dazed and unable to focus when the family visited through a window.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Lynsey Weatherspoon for NPR\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\n\"I just didn\\'t see it coming,\" McKinney said. \"I just didn\\'t understand why those kinds of questions were being asked.\"\\nLater on, another call: Their mom had stopped breathing on her own.\\n\"The doctor described what it would be like to be on a ventilator, and it was pretty much to prolong the inevitable, and she would suffer,\" McKinney remembers. \"We had to make that heartbreaking decision to let her go.\"\\nErnestine Mann died in the afternoon on March 29. She was 84.\\n\"I understand we are all on the clock and sooner or later we have to go, but not like that,\" Bill Mann said. \"She didn\\'t have to go this way.\"\\nErnestine Mann\\'s death was at the start of a wave of others at the facility. Nancy Finney died the next day. On April 3, Dr. Delutha King and Bernice Foster both died. King had been sent back and forth between different hospitals and the facility at least twice before he died, according to his son Ron Loving. \\nHattie Jay died April 5. She had tested negative for the virus, but her daughter Perdita Fisher believes she died because of the stress of isolation. Eddie Johnson Jr. died April 5 and his wife, Blanche, three days later. A photograph of them holding hands at the hospital went viral. \\nCatherine Hendrix died April 6. Her son Cedric said he still sometimes drives by the facility, wondering what went wrong. Four day later, Lois King, Delutha\\'s wife, died on the day her husband was buried. Dorothy McGirt and Gloria Bolds both died April 12. JoeAnn Snead had only lived at the facility for a little more than two weeks before she was sent to the hospital, where she spent about a month before she died on April 21. A week and a half after that, on May 2, Edgar Lewis died. \\nAt least 17 were dead of COVID-19 by the end, though state records differ on whether the final death toll was 17 or 19. NPR was able to confirm the names of these 13 through family interviews, news reports and obituaries. And somewhere among all those deaths, there were at least four others whose names we couldn\\'t find at all.\\n\"We weren\\'t just going to leave them by themselves\"\\nFour families, including Mann\\'s, have ongoing lawsuits against the Arbor Co. The lawsuits allege that staff failed to wear personal protective equipment, or PPE; that asymptomatic staff who had been exposed to COVID-19 continued to work; and that the company failed to restrict outside visitors. The company denies any wrongdoing. \\n\\n                Ernestine Mann\\'s family is one of four families that have filed lawsuits against the Arbor Co.

The company denies any wrongdoing.\\nIn April and May, the Georgia Department of Community Health investigated complaints related to the outbreak at Arbor Terrace at Cascade and did not find any rule violations.\\nThe company declined NPR\\'s multiple requests for an interview, but it sent a statement from Harper, the company president, which is referenced throughout this article, and also answered questions in writing. \\n\"Like the rest of the country, we have been navigating uncharted waters and caring for those most at risk,\" Harper wrote.\\nThe company had infection control policies in place before COVID-19. Harper said that on Feb. 29, the company implemented additional safeguards, and it kept adding more protections throughout March and April, some even before the CDC or the state recommended them. Each community was responsible for implementing the plan, according to a record from the Georgia Department of Community Health.\\nSome of the outbreak at Arbor Terrace at Cascade, which happened so early in the U.S. experience of the pandemic, can be attributed to bad luck. But there were other factors that made this place vulnerable. \\nBy early March, employees at Arbor Terrace at Cascade told NPR they were beginning to feel nervous that they did not have enough personal protective equipment for themselves or the residents.\\n\"That\\'s when we really started to ask questions, because we\\'re like, OK, COVID-19 is real,\" said Heggins, the resident assistant who worked there at the time. \"We were asking our staff, like, \\'Hey, are there going to be any masks? Are there going to be more gloves? Will we have this protection? Because these are things that they\\'re saying that we need.\\' \"\\nThe CDC had recommended nearly a month earlier that caregivers working with someone they suspected of having the virus should wear PPE or a face mask. But PPE shortages were rampant across the country, and, documents show, Arbor Terrace at Cascade was no different. \\nIn a statement to NPR, Harper acknowledged the difficulties in getting PPE: \"Although maintaining adequate PPE was challenging, Arbor Terrace at Cascade never ran out of PPE.\"\\nHe told NPR that on March 2, the facility began \"taking steps to secure PPE beyond the PPE already available at the community. This included purchases from PPE distributors, donations from businesses in the community, and requests to government entities.\"\\n\\n                Georgia state records from March 27, when the outbreak at Arbor Terrace at Cascade had already begun, say the facility needed more personal protective equipment.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Photo illustration by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nGeorgia state records from March 27, when the outbreak at Arbor Terrace at Cascade had already begun, say the facility needed more personal protective equipment.\\nAccording to records from the Georgia Department of Public Health, eight of the 11 Arbor Co. locations in Georgia requested hundreds of N95 respirators, surgical masks, face shields, gowns and gloves between March 13 and 31. None of these orders ended up being fulfilled. A spokesperson for the department told NPR it needed to \"prioritize the needs of acute care hospitals.\" Arbor Terrace at Cascade was one of the three that didn\\'t request any personal protective equipment from the public health department during that two-week time period, although it may have requested PPE from other sources.\\n\"Thankfully, Arbor Terrace had a sufficient supply of PPE prior to and at the start of the novel COVID-19 virus pandemic,\" Harper wrote. \\nBut on March 27, the day after the first case at the facility was officially reported to the state, the Georgia Department of Public Health reviewed the facility\\'s COVID-19 procedures via a video call. According to an infection prevention assessment obtained by NPR from that review, the department indicated that the facility \"has limited masks,\" and \"needs more PPE\" for staff to wear consistently when a resident was showing COVID-19 symptoms and when helping residents to perform \"high contact activities\" such as bathing and dressing. According to the document, the facility reported having staffing issues. By then, the record shows, 15 staff members were showing symptoms of an \"ILI,\" or influenza-like illness.\\n\"There were a lot of times where we would have to go in the rooms without wearing PPE equipment,\" the staff member who asked not to be named told NPR. \"At the end of the day, we weren\\'t just going to leave them by themselves. We still had to take care of them.\"\\nThat\\'s not what the Arbor Co. was telling families at the time. \\nOn March 26, Harper sent an email to Cascade families, telling them that a resident had tested positive for the coronavirus. He assured families that \"all staff members will wear masks and gloves when interacting with all residents.\" \\nThe next day, the day that the public health department indicated the company \"needs more PPE,\" Harper sent another email: \"We have reviewed our processes and procedures with the Georgia Department of Public Health and they have assured us that we are doing what we should be doing in this situation.\"\\nThe company did keep taking measures to stop the spread of the virus. A disinfecting company conducted a full decontamination of the building on March 27, the day after the first confirmed case. On April 3 and 16, the Georgia National Guard also conducted decontaminations of the facility. \\nBut by then, it was too late.\\n\\'\\'That difference can mean life or death\\'\\'\\nNot only did the company\\'s missteps at Arbor Terrace at Cascade leave it susceptible to an outbreak, but more systemic factors, such as the facility\\'s population and its location in Atlanta, meant those missteps ultimately proved disastrous. \\nAssisted living facilities, which are home to about 800,000 mostly older Americans, are especially vulnerable to infectious diseases: You\\'ve got a vulnerable population living together with workers coming in and out. Today, nearly 40% of all the U.S. COVID-19 deaths have happened at long-term care facilities such as assisted living facilities, retirement communities and nursing homes.\\nArbor Terrace at Cascade was no different. But once the virus was inside the facility, it might have hit those residents harder. African Americans have higher rates of diabetes and high blood pressure, and higher death rates from heart disease. Health disparities such as these have been attributed to systemic racism, and those particular conditions also put individuals at higher risk for severe complications from COVID-19.\\n\\n                A view of an empty John Lewis Freedom Parkway against the backdrop of downtown Atlanta on April 4.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Kevin C.

One June study found COVID-19 cases in nursing homes across the country are more related to location rather than whether the facility had a poor rating or past infection control violations. Indeed, Arbor Terrace at Cascade had fewer violations per routine inspection than most of the other company locations, according to a database created by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\\nMost of Atlanta is part of Fulton County. That county has about 10% of Georgia\\'s population, but by March 21, it had nearly 20% of the confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state. And within Fulton County, the area near Arbor Terrace at Cascade in southwest Atlanta was hit harder still in the pandemic\\'s early weeks. \\nThere are many reasons why one area might have more COVID-19 cases than another: more people living in crowded housing, using public transportation or who are unable to work from home, among others. Some of those factors are related to poverty, which disproportionately affects people of color. But a New York University study in July of 10 major U.S. metro areas, including Atlanta, found that racial disparities in COVID-19 infections existed beyond disparities related to income.\\n\"When we looked at the early phase of the pandemic within urban U.S. areas, we did not see income explaining away all of the racial and ethnic disparities in COVID outcomes,\" says Sam Adhikari, who led the NYU study and is an assistant professor of biostatistics at NYU\\'s School of Medicine. \"There are other structural systems and historical context that might be putting them at higher risk.\"\\nEven a middle-class neighborhood such as Cascade has subtle signs of systemic disinvestment if you look closely. Take home values: Though the median household income of that area is similar to that of Atlanta, the median home value around Cascade is around $120,000 less than Atlanta\\'s median home value.\\nNationwide, homes in predominantly Black neighborhoods are worth 23% less than homes in neighborhoods with few or no Black residents, according to research led by Andre Perry, a fellow at the Brookings Institution.

And we know that wealth is a protector of sorts, that when we have these economic or health crises, wealth enables us to shelter more,\" Perry says. \"Racism transcends class.

We wish we could tell you. Our protocols and processes are exactly the same in all of our senior living communities.\"\\nNPR could not confirm whether the company\\'s protocols, pandemic-related or otherwise, were indeed the same across all its communities, but former Cascade staff members told NPR that Arbor Terrace at Cascade was simply not as nice as the other Arbor Co. locations.\\nPart of that stems from the age of the community: Most of the other Arbor Co. locations in Georgia were opened or renovated more than a decade after Arbor Terrace at Cascade first opened.\\n\"The building is 20 years old. So how do you compare that to a 6-year-old building?\" a former wellness director at the facility, who asked not to be named, told NPR. \"Everything about the experience is going to be different.\"\\nThat staff member added that they believed the company\\'s standards were still the same.

The company confirmed to NPR that a new van was purchased for the facility in 2016. \\n\"All of a sudden because he\\'s embarrassed now, he was forced to go and get it done. So they did give us money,\" Davis said. \"You can imagine if we\\'re coming to that event ... how bad it had to look.\"\\nDavis recalled another incident, when the remnants of Hurricane Irma hit in September 2017. \\n\"I remember it like yesterday. The hurricane was coming. We\\'d been asking for generators for years. We need generators. We need generators. And they\\'d never approve that,\" Davis said.\\nCascade\\'s power went out for two days, Davis said. Once the sun went down, he said staff put glow sticks around the residents\\' necks. Eventually, he said the corporate office brought them gas-powered generators to string up some lights. \\n\"The other Arbor Terraces, they already had generators and they were fully functional and there were no issues,\" Davis said. \\nThe company confirmed that it has purchased portable generators during storm-related power outages but did not confirm that the other Georgia locations had generators before Arbor Terrace at Cascade. \\n\"The only reason we were not prepared is because we didn\\'t have the funding to be prepared,\" Davis said. \"But as a company, your job is to see where something has a deficit and try to help them navigate through that and not just say, \\'Well, you just can\\'t afford it because you don\\'t have enough revenue coming in.\\' \"\\nIn his statement to NPR, Harper did not acknowledge any differences in budgets between the locations but did confirm that each community has its own budget and \"funds are not commingled with other Arbor communities.\"\\nOf course, any budget differences that did exist between the facilities wouldn\\'t necessarily add up to a higher likelihood of a virus outbreak.\\n\"But if you\\'re always shortchanging something, if you\\'re always the last to be part of something, you can\\'t help but to fail,\" Davis said. \"Can you imagine what happens when a pandemic hits? You get the response that you have.\"\\nIn his statement to NPR, Harper wrote: \"In 1999, we opened Arbor Terrace at Cascade as a state-of-the-art community. We maintain the campus with vigor. ...

His announcement that he has now stopped working at the medical compound brought a new round of praise for Phillips, both for his work as a doctor and for speaking out.\\nToday, I worked my final shift at Walter Reed ER. I will miss the patients and my military and civilian coworkers - they have been overwhelmingly supportive. I’m honored to have worked there and I look forward to new opportunities. I stand by my words, and I regret nothing.\\nPhillips, who is also the chief of disaster medicine at George Washington University, said in October that Trump\\'s insistence on riding in a motorcade past supporters gathered across the street from Walter Reed exposed his security detail and others to a high risk of infection by the deadly coronavirus.\\n\"The irresponsibility is astounding. My thoughts are with the Secret Service forced to play,\" the physician wrote in a tweet later deleted. He also dismissed Trump\\'s outing — which came one month before the national election — as \"political theater\" that forced other people into quarantine and put them at unnecessary risk.\\nWhen NPR contacted Walter Reed about Phillips\\' status on Monday, a representative stated that the doctor worked there as a contract employee.\\nThe medical center \"provides requirements for contract employees to the contract agency,\" the representative said. \"The contract agency then works together with contract employees to determine individual schedules.

Health care workers across the country have started receiving COVID-19 vaccines, but doctors and nurses at some hospitals say vaccine distribution has been chaotic.\\nHealth care workers across the country have started receiving COVID-19 vaccines, but doctors and nurses at some of the nation\\'s top hospitals are raising the alarm, charging that vaccine distribution has been unfair and a chaotic \"free-for-all.\" \\nAt hospitals in Massachusetts, New York, Arizona, California and elsewhere, medical professionals say that those with the most exposure to COVID-19 patients are not always the first to get vaccinated. And others who have little or no contact with COVID-19 patients have received vaccinations.\\n\"It definitely feels a little bit like a slap in the face,\" said Jennifer DeVincent, who has been a neonatal intensive care unit nurse in the prestigious Mass General Brigham hospital system for 16 years and attends deliveries with coronavirus-positive mothers. \\nAt Mass General Brigham, the plan was for hospital staff to use an app to sign up for vaccinations. Everyone is sorted into different \"waves\" meant to prioritize those most at risk. However, the plan relies on the honor code, and internal emails obtained by NPR instruct employees to \"self-police.\"\\nThere were problems from the beginning. The app crashed when too many people tried to sign up at once. Then, when it was up and running again, all the appointments were snapped up within minutes. DeVincent was taking care of a patient the entire time appointments were available. Some night shift workers at Mass General Brigham woke up to learn they had slept through the announcement of the new system and the sign-up windows. \\n\"It turned into somewhat of a free-for-all,\" DeVincent said. \"Those that work the most have had the hardest time getting an appointment because you can\\'t always log on at that exact moment.\"\\nDeVincent said her frustration turned to anger when she realized exactly who was getting the shots: Some of the first to be vaccinated were managers, coordinators and others who do not do hands-on patient care. \\n\"It makes me feel awful that anyone feels anything less than fully valued,\" said Paul Biddinger, medical director for emergency preparedness at Mass General Brigham. He acknowledged the challenges and miscommunications, saying they should have managed expectations better given the limited number of doses available. However, he said, the honor code is necessary for an organization with a staff of more than 80,000. \\n\"It\\'s actually relatively complex to figure out who is working where,\" he said. \"We have staff who move among our hospitals and work in different roles in different hospitals.\" \\nBiddinger has been going through the data and said it\\'s relatively rare for people to jump the line and usually a misunderstanding. He said they\\'re working on making the guidelines clearer and fixing issues in the app.\\nWhile vaccine rollout has gone smoothly at many hospitals, similar challenges have arisen at places such as New York-Presbyterian and Stanford Medicine. \\nIn Arizona\\'s Maricopa County, the county government is responsible for distribution. While the county tried to survey health care workers and prioritize them based on various risk factors, many have scrambled to find workarounds. Rumor proliferated about a link that was supposed to be private but let anyone get an appointment. Same with a phone number. One doctor, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution, called the Maricopa County rollout \"a bit disorganized and ripe for exploitation.\"\\nIn New York, a doctor affiliated with Northwell Health conducts 10 or more COVID-19 tests a day on patients but has not been able to get a vaccine appointment. \\n\"It\\'s really very upsetting,\" said the doctor, who also requested anonymity for fear her residency privileges would be taken away. \"Throughout this whole pandemic, I\\'ve never felt so dejected as I do right now.\"\\nThe doctor said Northwell – a network with 23 hospitals and 74,000 employees – has not been sharing much information. The main communication, the doctor said, is: \" \\'Wait your turn, and you\\'ll get invited when you get invited.\\' \"\\nWhile waiting, the doctor saw colleagues, such as radiologists, posting vaccine selfies on social media. \"Many of these physicians are people who either work remotely or work in fields where they are not treating COVID patients every day,\" the doctor said. \"There really seems to be no rhyme or reason to who is getting vaccinated.\"\\nBut Mark Jarrett pushed back, insisting there\\'s a detailed rollout plan. As the chief quality officer and deputy chief medical officer at Northwell, he said, \"This is a monumental task that we\\'ve never had to do before.\"\\nHe said they are taking into account not just who has the most exposure to COVID-19 patients, but a lot of other factors as well. For example, he said, a hospital may have only two interventional radiologists. Not wanting them both to fall sick, they may get moved up in the line. Or, since the vaccine can have side effects that might make someone miss work the next day, Northwell is making sure not to vaccinate a whole unit at one time. Its system is also taking into account how bad the outbreak is in a hospital\\'s particular area. \\n Jarrett acknowledged the system hasn\\'t been perfect. And, he said, they are trying to adjust as they learn about the issues. But the doctor affiliated with Northwell said each day treating COVID-19 patients is stressful – and knowing there\\'s a vaccine available, but not being able to access it, just adds to the challenges facing front-line workers. \\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

Hathloul\\'s case has drawn widespread scrutiny since her arrest in the spring of 2018.\\nAs it punished Hathloul, the Specialized Criminal Court suspended nearly three years of her sentence — and because Hathloul has already spent well over two years in prison, she could be released in less than three months, according to her sister, Lina al-Hathloul. Discussing the verdict on Twitter, she adds that both sides of the case could appeal Monday\\'s ruling.\\nBREAKING : Today @LoujainHathloul  was sentenced to-5 years and 8 months in prison- A suspension of 2 years and 10 months in addition to the time already served (since May 2018) which would see her release in approximately two months.-5 years travel banNote: 👇🏽\\nIn addition to the prison term, the court imposed a five-year travel ban on Hathloul, her sister said. The suspended portion of the prison term could also be reimposed if the activist is found to have committed any crime over the next three years, according to the Saudi state-linked news outlet Sabq.\\nHathloul, 31, was the most high-profile of a group of female activists who were arrested shortly before the Saudi kingdom lifted its long-standing ban on women driving. Her family says she has been tortured and not allowed to have phone calls or visits from her family.\\nSabq reports that the Specialized Criminal Court found that Hathloul agitated for changing the kingdom\\'s laws and used the Internet to push a foreign agenda. A judge stated that Hathloul confessed to the charges, saying that the activist, who has gone on at least two hunger strikes during her lengthy detention, was not coerced.\\nThe punishment is \"deeply troubling,\" the U.N. human rights office tweeted. Noting that Hathloul has been \"arbitrarily detained\" since 2018, the office added, \"We understand early release is possible, and strongly encourage it as matter of urgency.\"\\nSaudi Arabia’s sentencing of Loujain al-Hathloul for simply exercising her universal rights is unjust and troubling. As we have said, the Biden-Harris administration will stand up against human rights violations wherever they occur.\\nIn a signal that President-elect Joe Biden is likely to be more willing to criticize Saudi Arabia than the outgoing Trump administration, national security adviser-designate Jake Sullivan in a tweet described the sentence as \"unjust and troubling. As we have said, the Biden-Harris administration will stand up against human rights violations wherever they occur.\"\\nSaudi officials transferred Hathloul\\'s case to the court that normally deals with national security crimes and terrorism cases in late November. As NPR\\'s Jackie Northam reported, Hathloul had gone more than a year without a court appearance. Al-Hathloul\\'s sister Lina told NPR that her parents, who attended the November court session, saw \"a very weak, tired, exhausted Loujain.\"\\nHuman rights groups and foreign governments have criticized Hathloul\\'s treatment and the handling of her case.

They argue it could exacerbate health disparities.\\nAs the U.S. grapples with the effects of systemic racism, some in the medical community are questioning whether the tools they use to assess patient health may be contributing to racial health disparities.\\nThat debate is playing out most prominently in the world of kidney medicine. Black people are almost four times more likely to suffer from kidney failure than non-Hispanic whites. And once they get to that stage, Black patients spend months longer waiting for a kidney transplant than white patients.\\nNow, some doctors are asking whether a diagnostic formula most commonly used to assess the health of patients with chronic kidney disease may be unintentionally contributing to those poor outcomes — and reinforcing racist thinking.\\nThe tool in question is a formula used to estimate GFR, or glomerular filtration rate. It\\'s a measure of how fast a person\\'s kidneys filter blood. Lower kidney filtration rates suggest worse kidney function.\\nThe gold standard for measuring GFR is a burdensome process that involves urine collection over a 24-hour period as well as a blood sample. So instead, doctors and labs routinely estimate kidney function by measuring blood levels of creatinine, a waste product filtered by the kidneys, and then doing a calculation that also factors in the patient\\'s age and sex.\\nBut if a patient is African American, the person\\'s race also plays into this calculation. Doctors and labs will routinely apply what\\'s called a \"race correction\" or \"race adjustment\" to their estimated GFR number so that Black patients with chronic kidney disease end up with higher values.\\nCritics say the practice is based on flawed scientific assumptions tinged with racism. And because higher filtration rates suggest better kidney function, critics argue that correcting for race may delay critical referrals to specialists, potentially leading to worse outcomes.\\n\"Why are we on the side of overestimating [filtration rates] if it could result in Black patients getting less care, to put it bluntly?\" says Dr. Mallika Mendu, a kidney specialist and executive medical director of clinical operations for Brigham Health.\\nIn fact, this June, Mendu\\'s hospital system, Mass General Brigham, became one of a growing number of medical institutions in the U.S. to abandon the use of race in estimating GFR, amid a movement driven by medical students.\\nBut other kidney specialists argue that while the use of race in kidney medicine is flawed, the rush to abandon it might cause more harm than it cures.\\nIs the use of race exacerbating disparities?\\nMendu co-authored a study published this fall that found that if the race correction were removed, up to 1 out of every 3 Black patients would be reclassified as having a more severe stage of chronic kidney disease. And up to one-quarter of Black patients would have been reclassified from stage 3 to stage 4 of the disease — the final stage before kidney failure, which can trigger more advanced care.\\nThe findings suggest \"there is real potential for exacerbating disparities\" when a race correction is applied, Mendu says.\\nTo conduct the study, the researchers turned to a registry of more than 56,000 patients with chronic kidney disease created by the Mass General Brigham hospital network. Of those, 2,225 self-identified as African American. The researchers then recalibrated the Black patients\\' estimated GFR values to see what they would be without the race correction.\\nMendu says perhaps the most striking finding was that when the race correction was removed, 64 Black patients had a kidney filtration rate lower than 20 — the threshold at which patients are referred for a kidney transplant. But Mendu says records showed that none of those 64 patients had actually been referred or evaluated for a transplant, because with the race correction applied, their GFR values were hovering above that threshold.\\nThat\\'s a really big deal, she says, because that means those patients lost critical time on the waiting list for a new kidney.\\n\"The more time you spend on a waitlist, if you\\'re waiting for a kidney, the more likely you are to get a kidney,\" Mendu says.\\nGiven these existing disparities, Mendu says, kidney specialists should rethink the use of the race correction.\\nDr. Neil Powe, a kidney specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, is among those who caution against abandoning race in estimating GFR too quickly. He points out that racial disparities in outcomes for patients with chronic kidney disease existed long before the use of race to calculate kidney function became widespread two decades ago. And in the study from Mendu and her colleagues, he notes that 80% of the Black patients who did have an estimated GFR of 20 or lower with the race correction were not referred for a kidney transplant, either.\\nPowe says that this suggests the race-based equations \"are a smaller part of what\\'s causing disparities in African Americans getting waitlisted [for a kidney transplant]. And those other things that cause disparities could be racism as well.\"\\nFirst, do no harm\\nThe use of race-adjusted algorithms to estimate kidney filtration rates dates back to 1999. It was based on a study that included 1,304 white people and 197 Black people. The researchers found that, on average, Black people in the study had higher kidney filtration rates than white people at the same blood creatinine concentrations, suggesting that the formula then used to estimate GFR was underestimating kidney function in Black people. So the authors introduced a race correction to the formula that better fit the data.\\nAnother much larger study, published in 2009, revised the equation used to estimate GFR but also found that it more accurately reflected measured GFR when it adjusted values for Black patients.\\nDr. Vanessa Grubbs, a kidney specialist at the University of California, San Francisco and a longtime critic of using a race-adjusted GFR, says the originators of race adjustments in GFR algorithms were unable to explain why Black people might produce and clear creatinine from their bodies differently than white people do.\\n\"The suggestion that Black people and only Black people are different than every other human on the planet is just ludicrous,\" she says.\\nOne explanation that is often cited is muscle mass, since creatinine is a breakdown product of muscles. In the 1999 study, the authors observed that three previous studies had found Black people on average have greater muscle mass than white people. But as Grubbs noted in a recent paper, those studies, now decades old, were small and did not measure muscle mass directly. Yet the use of race as a proxy for muscle mass reinforces the notion that \"black bodies are biologically different than white ones,\" she wrote.\\nMendu notes that in the 2009 study, the majority of all patients — not just Black ones — had a sizable difference between their measured and estimated GFRs, suggesting that GFR is an imprecise variable.\\nAnd she says that race itself is a poor marker of biological difference. \"We know that there is more diversity within Black patients than there is genetic diversity between a Black person and a white person,\" she says. \"To say that somebody being Black is somehow a monolithic thing when it comes to genetics, when it comes to ancestry, I think is challenging.\"\\nHow, she asks, would you apply the race adjustment to someone biracial, like former President Barack Obama?\\nA movement for change\\nThe debate in kidney medicine comes amid a broader examination of the use of race in clinical diagnostics in the medical community. That reckoning has been brought about in large part by medical students at institutions across the country who have questioned the scientific evidence justifying the use of race in diagnostic formulas and whether that might be perpetuating inequalities.\\n\"From our social science and genetics faculty, we were getting a message loud and clear: Race is a social construct, and it\\'s not a reliable proxy for genetic difference. And then, on the other hand, our clinical faculty were turning around and teaching us that race is being used as a proxy for genetic difference every day in clinical medicine,\" says Dr. Leo Eisenstein, a second-year medical resident at New York University and Bellevue hospitals.\\nAs a medical student at Harvard University, Eisenstein was part of a coalition of students whose research and lobbying efforts convinced Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston to abandon the use of race in GFR in 2017. The students zeroed in on race-adjusted estimated GFR, he says, in part because it seemed to be systematically correcting Black patients to a healthier level in a way that might be less protective.\\nSince then, Eisenstein and some of his former classmates have advised medical students at other universities who are seeking to convince their institutions to abandon race-based GFR as well. This summer, the University of Washington health system and Vanderbilt University Medical Center also dropped race from their estimated GFR equations after students teamed up with faculty to examine the strength of the evidence behind the use of race adjustments.\\nEisenstein says for younger generations of medical students who see the world with a racial justice lens, the issue was clear — the race correction had to go.\\n\"We\\'re possibly perpetuating or worsening racial health disparities without anyone intending to do so,\" says Eisenstein.\\nSeeking a new standard\\nIn August, the National Kidney Foundation and the American Society of Nephrology formed a task force to debate the pros and cons of using race in estimated GFR. The group is expected to issue its interim recommendations in January 2021. Powe is co-chair of the panel; Mendu is on it as well. Both agree that if doctors do continue to use race-adjusted GFR, they need to be transparent with Black patients about it and they should not rely on GFR alone to make decisions about patient care.\\nAnother member of the panel, Dr. Lesley Inker, is a kidney specialist at Tufts University who helped develop the revised 2009 GFR algorithm that includes a race correction. She too thinks that the reasons behind the observed differences in GFR values for Black and white patients are not well understood and that the use of race in such calculations has limitations.\\n\"I think it\\'s appropriate these questions keep getting asked,\" she says.\\nBut Inker warns that moving to abandon the use of race in GFR too quickly could have widespread unintended consequences and could potentially lead to less care for Black patients.\\nWithout the race correction, Inker says, Black patients\\' kidney function might look worse than it actually is. For patients with other medical conditions, she says that could mean less access to treatments, clinical trials and medications that they would otherwise have qualified for. For example, metformin is the first drug of choice to treat diabetes in patients with chronic kidney disease, but those with a GFR of 30 or below cannot use the drug, which means they might have to turn to other medications with more side effects.\\nPowe notes that it could even affect Black patients\\' ability to secure life insurance.\\nPowe says he sees why the use of race to estimate GFR is problematic, but when the data show actual racial and ethnic differences in kidney function, he asks, \"Do we just ignore them?\"\\n\"There\\'s benefits and disadvantages on both sides,\" Inker says. Her research group is working on a more precise formula to calculate GFR without the use of demographics, and it\\'s analyzing how eliminating the race correction could affect patients.\\nUltimately, Inker says, doctors should be asking, \"What\\'s the best outcome for each individual patient?\"\\nEveryone interviewed for this story agrees that an ideal solution would be to use another biomarker to measure kidney function that does not rely on race. But Powe worries that doctors will start dropping race-corrected estimated GFR before the broader kidney specialist community agrees on what that biomarker should be. \"We want to have a standardized approach so that we don\\'t have chaos in the medical community,\" Powe says.\\nMeanwhile, the use of race in other clinical diagnostic tools has come to the attention of lawmakers. In September, the House Ways and Means Committee asked medical professional associations to reexamine the use — and misuse — of race in clinical care.\\nTheir inquiry was prompted in part by an article published this summer in the New England Journal of Medicine — co-authored by Eisenstein — that analyzed 13 clinical algorithms that incorporate a patient\\'s race in various specialties, from kidney medicine to pulmonology, obstetrics, urology and cardiology.\\nAll of the examples cited had the potential to affect the quality of care that people of color receive — for example, by underestimating the risks of heart failure in hospitalized Black patients or by steering more pregnant women of color toward cesarean sections if they\\'d had one in the past.\\n\"That\\'s perverse. The minorities are the ones who have the worst health outcomes,\" says Dr. David Jones, a physician and medical historian at Harvard and a co-author of the NEJM article.\\nJones stresses that he and others aren\\'t calling for medicine to abandon the collection of race data altogether, because it\\'s necessary in order to understand the racial health disparities that exist in the United States. Instead he says: \"We\\'re calling to take a really close look at predictive uses of race, especially ones that exaggerate or accentuate health disparities.\"\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

In response, the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency is asking lawmakers for greater job protections in the year ahead.\\n\"Our job, we know, has never been more important, more significant or more challenging than it is right now,\" said Michael Horowitz, the inspector general at the Justice Department, who also leads a government-wide group related to pandemic oversight.\\nIn 2020, the administration fired two of their brethren. Michael Atkinson, the IG for the intelligence community, lost his job after he forwarded a whistleblower complaint to Congress that figured in Trump\\'s impeachment. And Steve Linick, the IG for the State Department, was dismissed after he identified retaliation against career public servants. \\nA third, Glenn Fine, had served as acting inspector general at the Defense Department for four years. Fine, known for hard-hitting investigations during his years in government, quit weeks after he was demoted and effectively removed from leading the pandemic oversight effort by Trump. \\nAt the Transportation Department, authorities moved to replace a longtime career official with a political appointee from another agency. Democrats in Congress asked whether that move was intended to thwart an ongoing probe into whether Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, who is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, directed money to Kentucky to help her husband. \\nA Transportation Department spokesman told NPR: \"The Department of Transportation\\'s Deputy Inspector General, Mitch Behm, was not removed or fired. He continues to serve in his long-time role as Deputy IG. ... Behm was the most senior career staffer in the office only after a medical vacancy by the previous IG.\"\\nGood government groups said the politically motivated firings and demotions threaten the independence of the inspectors general and the critical work that their staff members do. Yet those moves are allowed under current law.\\nDanielle Brian, executive director of the nonpartisan Project on Government Oversight, said President-elect Joe Biden needs to make inspectors general a priority after the community was \"ravaged\" in the Trump years.\\n\"It\\'s essential that President Biden prioritize restoring independence to these watchdogs,\" Brian said. \"It will be a delicate balance ensuring only qualified people remain as agency watchdogs while restoring confidence that if an IG does their job with integrity and independence, they have no reason to fear being removed.\"\\nAllison Lerner, the inspector general at the National Science Foundation, will lead the council of inspectors general starting next month. She and other watchdogs are asking Congress to update the law and require the president or an agency head to explain, in more detail, the reasons for firing an inspector general.\\nSen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., is co-sponsoring that bill. Hassan said there\\'s bipartisan agreement that IGs \"must be protected from political pressure.\"\\n\"Inspectors General conduct valuable oversight of federal agencies to help root out waste, fraud, and abuse. They also importantly safeguard critical government functions from political interference and help protect whistleblowers,\" Hassan said. \"But the only way they can perform this critical work is if they operate independently and without fear of retribution for the problems that they expose.\"\\nSen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, also supports a legislative fix.\\n\"With trillions of taxpayer dollars being distributed to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and an ever-increasing national debt, Portman believes IGs should be encouraged and supported in their role to root out waste and inefficiency,\" said Emily Benavides, his communications director.\\nTo start, in January, there are at least 12 vacancies in the watchdog ranks.

People were advised to wipe down their packages and the cans they bought at the grocery store.\\nBut scientists have learned a lot this year about the coronavirus and how it\\'s transmitted, and it turns out all that scrubbing and disinfecting might not be necessary.\\nIf a person infected with the coronavirus sneezes, coughs or talks loudly, droplets containing particles of the virus can travel through the air and eventually land on nearby surfaces. But the risk of getting infected from touching a surface contaminated by the virus is low, says Emanuel Goldman, a microbiologist at Rutgers University.\\n\"In hospitals, surfaces have been tested near COVID-19 patients, and no infectious virus can be identified,\" Goldman says.\\nWhat\\'s found is viral RNA, which is like \"the corpse of the virus,\" he says. That\\'s what\\'s left over after the virus dies.\\n\"They don\\'t find infectious virus, and that\\'s because the virus is very fragile in the environment — it decays very quickly,\" Goldman says.\\nBack in January and February, scientists and public health officials thought surface contamination was a problem. In fact, early studies suggested the virus could live on surfaces for days.\\nIt was assumed transmission occurred when an infected person sneezed or coughed on a nearby surface and \"you would get the disease by touching those surfaces and then transferring the virus into your eyes, nose or mouth,\" says Linsey Marr, an engineering professor at Virginia Tech who studies airborne transmission of infectious disease.\\nSo people were advised to clean common areas with disinfectant, wipe down cans and boxes from the grocery store and even wear gloves.\\nIn retrospect, Marr says that was \"overkill.\" Today, she says, \"all the evidence points toward breathing in the virus from the air as being the most important route of transmission.\"\\nScientists now know that the early surface studies were done in pristine lab conditions using much larger amounts of virus than would be found in a real-life scenario.\\nEven so, many of us continue to attack door handles, packages and groceries with disinfectant wipes, and workers across the U.S. spend hours disinfecting surfaces in public areas like airports, buildings and subways.\\nThere\\'s no scientific data to justify this, says Dr. Kevin Fennelly, a respiratory infection specialist with the National Institutes of Health.\\n\"When you see people doing spray disinfection of streets and sidewalks and walls and subways, I just don\\'t know of any data that supports the fact that we\\'re getting infected from viruses that are jumping up from the sidewalk.\"\\nMarr says focusing on cleaning surfaces is not the best way to slow infection.\\n\"Instead of paying so much attention to cleaning surfaces, we might be better off paying attention to cleaning the air, given the finite amount of time and resources,\" Marr says.\\nFennelly agrees, noting that airborne transmission is more likely in indoor public places like restaurants.\\n\"Why aren\\'t we doing more to figure out ways to ventilate those areas?\" he asks. \"It would be better to use ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, which we know can kill these viruses in the air.\"\\nFiguring out how to prevent coronavirus transmission in office buildings, schools, bars and restaurants is definitely a challenge, he says, but \"we have a lot of really smart engineers and architects and industrial hygienists who know how to handle airborne infection.\"\\nSpraying disinfectant is not only unproductive, but it\\'s potentially dangerous, according to Delphine Farmer, an atmospheric chemist at Colorado State University.\\nHeavy use of disinfectants, like bleach and hydrogen peroxide, can \"produce toxic molecules that then we breathe,\" she warns.\\nAnd breathing in toxic particles can affect our health, Farmer says. The molecules can react directly with the cells in lung tissue and cause oxidative stress. And certain molecules are known to be toxic. \"It\\'s like breathing in poison,\" she says.\\nEarly on in the pandemic, Farmer says, many people were making cleaning mistakes: \"There were a lot of cases of people cleaning their groceries with bleach and vinegar, which is a recipe to create some very nasty chlorine gas, and people were getting quite ill from those side effects.\"\\nBottom line: Health experts emphasize that the most important way to avoid infection is to stay away from crowds and wear a mask whenever you leave the house. Limit the time you spend in any indoor space with people outside of your own household — and wear a mask when you\\'re in those spaces.\\nWhen you\\'re out in public, be aware of surfaces you touch, and wash your hands often. It\\'s much more effective to wash your hands thoroughly than try to clean everything you touch.\\nAnd if you do decide to keep wiping down canned goods or packages that arrive at your house, there\\'s no need for fancy cleaning products; \"old-fashioned soap and water\" will do just fine, Farmer says.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

Lin was also involved as executive producer on the project.\\nLin became sick last week and was hospitalized on Dec. 16, reportedly barely able to walk and with symptoms of \"acute illness.\" He was immediately brought to the ICU for treatment, where he had to be resuscitated after his heart stopped, according to local reports.\\nBy Dec. 24, Shanghai police said a man was detained for the alleged poisoning of Lin. Police referred to both men by their surnames, but media reports said the detained suspect was Lin\\'s colleague, Xu Yao. \\nThe next day, Lin was dead.\\nXu was a senior executive for Yoozoo\\'s film and television division. Alleged infighting at the company may be the motive behind the attack on Lin, according to reports. Those reports suggested that Lin may have been poisoned by a tainted cup of pu\\'er, a fermented tea.\\nWhen Yoozoo purchased the film rights to develop The Three Body Problem series in 2015, plans to develop the movie under its own production team were fraught with problems. That included senior personnel changes throughout the production and difficulties on set, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Eventually the company gave up on the endeavor and sold the rights for the film to Netflix, as well as the video game production for the trilogy to a Chinese company.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

Senate Republicans blocked a bipartisan effort to include $1,200 direct payments in the relief deal. \\nTrump also complained that too much money was being allocated to foreign aid and domestic projects not related to the coronavirus pandemic. The reality is that congressional leaders passed the relief bill in combination with a broader spending bill that funds the government. The president has signed bills including money for these programs in the past couple of years.\\nOn Christmas Eve, House Democrats sought to follow Trump\\'s lead and pursue larger direct payments by unanimous consent, while House Republicans attempted to revisit the foreign aid section of the omnibus bill. Both changes were blocked by the other party. \\nIn his statement Sunday night, Trump said the House will vote Monday on a previously planned bill to increase payments to individuals from $600 to $2,000. Trump added: \"The Senate will start the process for a vote that increases checks to $2,000.\"\\nThe President must immediately call on Congressional Republicans to end their obstruction and to join him and Democrats in support of our stand-alone legislation to increase direct payment checks to $2,000, which will be brought to the Floor tomorrow. https://t.co/mMaMUNwRKR\\nThe president also said that he \"will sign the Omnibus and Covid package with a strong message that makes clear to Congress that wasteful items need to be removed.\"\\nThe Democratic-led House is highly unlikely to take up those spending items.\\nTrump\\'s statement also mentions items that are not part of the relief and spending measure. \\n\"Congress has promised that Section 230, which so unfairly benefits Big Tech at the expense of the American people, will be reviewed and either be terminated or substantially reformed,\" he wrote. \"Likewise, the House and Senate have agreed to focus strongly on the very substantial voter fraud which took place in the November 3 Presidential election.\"\\nThere\\'s no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the election, which Trump falsely claims he won. President-elect Joe Biden is set to be sworn in on Jan. 20.\\nA lack of a repeal of Section 230, which provides some legal protections for technology companies, was one of the reasons Trump said he vetoed the annual defense authorization bill. Both congressional chambers are planning to return to Washington, D.C., in the coming days to attempt to override that veto.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

The site is about 18 miles southeast of Naples, Italy.\\nEver wonder what a 2,000-year-old fast-food restaurant might look like?\\nWell, new photos from researchers might give you an idea. Archaeologists said on Saturday they excavated a complete thermopolium — a Roman food counter — in the ancient city of Pompeii.\\nResearchers are analyzing the findings to create a more complete picture of the daily life — and diet — of a person in Pompeii.\\n\"As well as being another insight into daily life at Pompeii, the possibilities for study of this Thermopolium are exceptional, because for the first time an area of this type has been excavated in its entirety,\" Massimo Osanna, interim director general of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii, said in a statement. \\nArchaeologists have made discoveries in Pompeii, about 18 miles southeast of Naples, Italy, for centuries. The community was buried in ash and pumice when Mount Vesuvius erupted in A.D. 79, killing at least hundreds of people. The remains of two humans were found inside the stall.\\nBut the ash preserved items showing everyday life of the city\\'s inhabitants, serving as an archaeological gold mine.\\nThese types of food stalls were common in Rome, and researchers have discovered 80 in Pompeii. But this stall was the first to be excavated in its entirety.\\nSo what\\'s on the menu for an ancient Roman street food vendor? The researchers found remnants of duck, goat, pig, fish and snails in earthen pots, sometimes combined in the same dish. \\nThe storekeeper lowered the pots of hot food into circular holes in the counter. Crushed beans were found in a jar, likely used to modify the taste and color of wine. \\n\\n                A painting adorns a counter of a thermopolium, depicting two upside-down mallard ducks and a rooster.\\n                \\n                    \\n                    Luigi Spina/Archaeological Park of Pompeii via AP\\n                    \\n                \\nhide caption\\n\\nA painting adorns a counter of a thermopolium, depicting two upside-down mallard ducks and a rooster.\\nResearchers discovered paintings of animals — including a rooster and ducks — possibly a menu to indicate some of the food sold at the stall.

But it was his guitar solos that just astounded audiences and fellow musicians alike. He was idolized by bluegrass and acoustic music fans in large part because he was determined never to let them down.\\nRice died on Christmas morning at the age of 69. His death was first announced by the International Bluegrass Music Association.\\nDavid Anthony Rice was born in Danville, Va., on June 8, 1951. His father was a welder and the family moved to Los Angeles, where the youngster got into bluegrass. His first big influence was guitarist Clarence White and the Kentucky Colonels.\\nAt the age of 19, Rice moved back East to play professionally, eventually joining banjo player J.D. Crowe\\'s band, the New South. In 1975, they released the landmark album, J.D. Crowe and the New South. Its progressive sounds marked a dramatic shift in bluegrass and the album became so iconic among fans that it was known simply by its record label catalogue number: Rounder 0044.\\nJ.D. Crowe and the New South - \"Summer Wages\"\\nIt was during this period that Rice first heard the music of mandolinist David Grisman, who was pushing boundaries even further. So Rice moved back to California to join Grisman\\'s Quintet in San Francisco. This is when the guitarist truly stepped out as a leading voice in new acoustic music. The musicians studied improvisation and chord theory with jazz guitarist John Carlini and Rice grew exponentially. (In 1995, the two released one of the most beautiful guitar duo albums ever recorded, River Suite for Two Guitars.)\\nTony Rice and John Carlini \"Banister River\"\\nHe eventually left Grisman to form the Tony Rice Unit, which played everything from jazz to bluegrass. \\nRice also recorded duet albums with Grisman, multi-instrumentalist Ricky Skaggs and fellow guitarist Norman Blake. He collaborated with banjo player Bela Fleck and co-led the Bluegrass Album Band.\\nTony Rice Unit \"Gasology\"\\nBut the road took a toll on Rice.  He had to stop singing in the mid-1990s because of a condition called muscle tension dysphonia, which constricted the muscles around his voice box. And by 2013, Rice\\'s fierce guitar playing led to lateral epicondylitis (commonly called tennis elbow) and he played his beloved Martin D-28 (which once belonged to Clarence White) for the last time in public at his induction to the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

Thailand is one of many countries now seeing a surge in cases.\\nThe last Sunday of 2020 was ushered in with both promise and apprehension on the global pandemic front.\\nThe European Union began immunizing residents with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. \"We are starting to turn the page on a difficult year,\" said the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, in a video posted on Twitter. The E.U. she added has \"secured enough doses for our whole population of 450 million people.\"\\nAt the same time, some of the year\\'s most severe lockdowns and travel restrictions are being implemented around the world, prompted by concerns that new variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, could lead to more rapid spread.\\nThe U.K. variant, which is now the dominant strain in Britain, \"may be more transmissible than previously circulating variants, with an estimated potential to increase the transmissibility of the virus by up to 70%,\" according to a statement from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are similar concerns about a new strain from South Africa that may be circulating in other countries as well.\\nOn the domestic front, travelers arriving in the U.S. from the U.K. are now required to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test under new rules issued by CDC on Christmas day.\\nMore than 40 other nations have gone even farther, blocking travelers from Britain entirely. Despite such measures, the new strain has already been detected in mainland Europe, Israel, Canada and Japan, among other places.\\nIn response Japan is banning nearly all foreigners (the declaration lists nationals from 152 countries as personae non gratae at least until February) and is imposing new restrictions on Japanese citizens returning from any country that\\'s reported cases of the U.K. variant. The new Japanese rules also apply to places where the South African strain is circulating.\\nA surge in cases and concerns over the more highly transmissible forms of the virus prompted Israel to go into its third lockdown on Sunday. For at least the next two weeks, Israelis are prohibited from visiting someone else\\'s home or traveling more than 1,000 meters from their own home â€“ a little more than half a mile. All non-essential businesses are shut. Restaurants can only offer take out.\\nGatherings such as weddings and funerals in Israel will be limited to 10 people indoors and 20 outside. This is generous compared to Hong Kong, which has put in place a \"prohibition of group gatherings of more than two persons.\" On Sundays in Hong Kong foreign domestic workers traditionally have the day off. Groups of women from the Philippines and Indonesia gather in small groups in parks and on sidewalks all across the city. They often share soft drinks and snacks. Municipal officials are now calling for them to stay home at their employer\\'s apartments.\\nHong Kong is also increasing quarantine requirements for incoming travelers. While some other places are shortening COVID quarantines from 14 days down to 10 or 7, Hong Kong is now requiring a mandatory 21 days. The quarantine is at the travelers own expense in a government-sanctioned hotel.\\nThailand, which had kept its daily tally of reported COVID-19 cases in the single digits for much of the pandemic, is grappling with its worst surge to date. Since mid-December, the country has seen a sharp rise in cases linked originally to a seafood market, including 121 new infections on Sunday. The spike in cases in Thailand has not been tied to the U.K. variant. But it illustrates that even countries that appear to have the disease under control can\\'t let their guard down.\\nSouth Korea, which successfully contained two earlier waves of COVID-19, is facing record numbers of new cases and a spike in fatalities.\\nThe United States, which already has the largest number of cases globally and regular reports of more than 200,000 new infections a day, is also bracing for grim numbers ahead. Over the weekend top health officials warned that travel and family gatherings during this holiday season are likely to lead to a further spike in cases.\\n\"As we get into the next few weeks, it might actually get worse,\" Anthony Fauci, the nation\\'s top infectious disease expert told CNN on Sunday.\\nEven though the U.K. variant hasn\\'t yet been detected in the U.S., many top immunologists believe it may already be circulating here.\\n\"I think it\\'s prudent and a good idea to do some form of testing, and not let somebody on the plane from the U.K. unless they have a documented negative COVID-19 test,\" Fauci said. Given the high levels of transmission already occurring in the U.S., a more transmissible form of the virus could mean more even more dire numbers just as massive vaccine campaigns are starting.\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor',\n",

The Hall of Fame knuckleballer died at 81 years old after a battle with cancer, his former team announced Sunday.\\nNational Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Phil Niekro — a longtime pitcher for the Milwaukee/Atlanta Braves who was known for his blistering knuckleball — died in his sleep after a long battle with cancer, the team announced Sunday. He was 81.\\nNiekro, who spent the majority of his 24 years in MLB playing for the Braves, pitched in 740 games — the most of any pitcher in the franchise, the team said in a statement. From full-season debut in 1967 until his retirement in 1987, Niekro pitched 5,404 innings — the most by any pitcher in the modern era.  Niekro won a Gold Glove Award five times. \\nNicknamed \"Knucksie,\" he also won the most games of any knuckleball pitcher. (A knuckleball is a rare and difficult pitch, delivered with virtually no spin, leading to an erratic motion through the air.)\\nWhen he retired at age 48, Niekro was the oldest player in major league history to play regularly. \\n\"We are heartbroken on the passing of our treasured friend,\" the Braves said. \"Knucksie was woven into the Braves fabric, first in Milwaukee and then in Atlanta. Phil baffled batters on the field and later was always the first to join in our community activities.\"\\nAs a child, Niekro learned his unique pitching style from his father — and then he decided to throw that pitch exclusively while in the minor leagues, according to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, to which Niekro was inducted in 1997.\\nIn 2013, the Baltimore Orioles hired Niekro to teach its minor league pitchers how to throw the knuckleball. As NPR\\'s Mark Memmott explained at the time, the relatively slow speed of the knuckleball places less stress on a pitcher\\'s arm — and therefore can help prolong a pitcher\\'s career.\\n\"Phil Niekro was one of the most distinctive and memorable pitchers of his generation,\" MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred Jr., said in a statement. \"But even more than his signature pitch and trademark durability, Phil will be remembered as one of our game\\'s most genial people. He always represented his sport extraordinarily well, and he will be deeply missed.\"\\nSponsor Message\\nBecome an NPR sponsor']"
