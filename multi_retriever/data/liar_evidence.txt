BREAKING: @NEAToday President @Lily_NEA reacts to radical ruling by #SCOTUS: "We are living in a system that is rigged to benefit special interests & billionaires, all at the expense of working people."

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.
California's utilities are “public monopolies” that are given a legislated profit. They are allowed to be monopolies in return for benefiting the public. San Diego Gas and Electric wants ratepayers to pay for its negligence in regards to wildfires. Southern California Edison wants to pass along the costs of its mismanagement at the San Onofre nuclear plant. Pacific Gas and Electric wants ratepayers to cover the cost of a settlement for its 2010 pipeline explosion.
Even though he received what he called a “shellacking” in the 2010 midterms, and even though the GOP made unprecedented political gains during his tenure, President Obama was always convinced the country was behind him. As Mara Liasson wrote for NPR in 2016: “During Obama's eight years in office, the Democrats have lost more House, Senate, state legislative and governors seats than under any other president.” She noted that the Obama legacy includes “one huge failure: a diminished Democratic Party.”
In 2013, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., invoked the so-called “nuclear option,” discarding traditional filibuster protections for the minority party in favor of requiring only a simple majority to approve judicial and executive branch nominees. He carved out an exception for people put forward for the Supreme Court. The next year – with CNN describing President Obama as an “unpopular president limping through his second term” – Republicans reclaimed control of the Senate. As a result of that achievement, President Obama’s chances of securing a liberal majority on the high court all but disappeared.

The University of Missouri is still facing enrollment and budgetary problems, including a $49 million budget shortfall, as a result of the 2015 social justice protests that caught national media attention. Many people remember the high-pitched yell of former University of Missouri professor Melissa Click. Click found herself at the center of weeks of unrest at the University of Missouri in 2015 and 2016. Click rose to infamy after a video of her calling for a student photojournalist to be physically removed from campus simply because he was documenting the protests. The protests involved accusations by students that the administration had mishandled several alleged racial issues on campus.
You've got to look at every issue from all sides." "I really have been pleasantly surprised how willing he is to tell Chuck Schumer to go fly a kite," she added, referring to the Senate minority leader. At other times, however, Jones has taken up liberal positions seen as risky for a Democratic senator from a GOP state. He aligned himself with most of his Democratic colleagues against Gina Haspel, Trump's pick for CIA director, arguing that her record on enhanced interrogation techniques was unacceptable. And instead of focusing on a politically safe issue in his maiden Senate floor speech, Jones struck a nerve by calling for a dialogue on gun violence after the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida.

The organization is pushing to let families stay another six months. U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin of Massachusetts wrote that ending the program would drain other public resources. He also said the evidence showed problems with the Federal Emergency Management Agency's efforts to notify and provide transitional help for the hurricane refugees. "The irreparable harm to the plaintiffs is obvious and overwhelming; tomorrow morning they will be evicted and homeless since by definition each plaintiff's home was rendered uninhabitable by the hurricane in Puerto Rico," he wrote in his decision. FEMA declined to comment on the lawsuit, but the Orlando Sentinel reports the agency confirmed it was working to notify hotels to extend the aid until July 5 to comply with the order.
“Sea levels have hardly risen and temperatures are still below those of the medieval warm period. Over time, temperature change seems to correlate rather more with sun spot activity than with carbon dioxide levels. “And even if carbon dioxide, a naturally occurring trace gas that’s necessary for life, really is the main climate change villain, Australia’s contribution to mankind’s emissions is scarcely more than 1%.”
Abbott framed his contribution not as a deliberate wrecking exercise but as an effort to “save” the government. “Far from wrecking the government, MPs worried about energy policy are trying to save it, with a policy that would be different from Labor’s and would give voters the affordable and reliable power they want.”
"Peace and tranquility are the fruits of justice," Lopez Obrador said. Exit polling by Consulta Mitofsky for the Televisa network forecast gubernatorial wins for allies of Lopez Obrador's Morena party in at least four of eight state races on the ballot plus for the head of government in Mexico City. The central state of Guanajuato was expected to go to a candidate of the conservative National Action Party. Mitofsky predicted Morena allies would take between 56 and 70 seats in the 128-member Senate and between 256 and 291 spots in the 500-seat lower house. "The anger that the average Mexican feels toward the way things are being governed has favored Lopez Obrador," said Shannon O'Neil, senior fellow for Latin America Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.
DAVID BRODY:
I'm here to report from the frontlines and, you know, with this whole idea of Make America Great Again, I'm telling you, in Democrats, Independents and, yes, Republican households, it has resonated because Democrats culturally-- you mentioned minimum wage. That's a cultural issue, you want to call it. But I'm talking about culturally, socially, they've moved to the left.
Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.

A writer for Slate magazine claimed:
Under the Trump administration, even naturalized citizens are now a target. The government agency that oversees immigration applications is hiring lawyers and immigration officers to review cases of immigrants suspected of obtaining citizenship through fake identities or other false information on their applications. Cases would be referred to the Department of Justice, where offenders could lose their citizenship or legal status.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
Tory differences over UK's post-Brexit future spill into the open Read more
The Labour leader has said the result of the 2016 vote should be respected, but his frontbenchers have been careful not to explicitly rule out a second referendum if the circumstances change. Earlier in the day, Len McCluskey, Unite’s general secretary, said May’s government had lost all authority or capacity to make decisions. “We are not, I repeat for my friends in the media, not, calling for a second referendum … But we remain open to the possibility of a vote on any deal the Tories come back with,” he said. “These people see in Brexit the chance to turn Britain into the low-wage, deregulated, race-to-the-bottom society of their dreams. But Brexit is turning into a nightmare for the rest of us – a nightmare of uncertainty above all.
Straight-A students are being turned away from British medical schools and forced to pay for training in Eastern Europe, while the National Health Service (NHS) plunders the Third World for already-trained doctors instead. The Daily Mail spoke to a number of star students who earned top A-levels and supplemented their CVs with spells volunteering at local GP surgeries, overseas clinics, hospices, and pharmacies — and even earned degrees in related fields such as Biomedical Science — who were turned away from British medical schools, despite the NHS facing a shortfall of some 10,000 doctors. Department of Health and Social Care figures show that only 6,000 of 18,000 medical school applicants were awarded places last year — with many of the 6,000 likely going to foreign applicants, who have often been favoured over British applicants. In fact, the Mail found that so many talented would-be medical students were being rejected that a cottage industry of English-language medical schools in countries such as Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Armenia, and Georgia have sprung up to cater to them — but even this option is not available to youngsters who cannot afford the fees.

In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions.

It’s shocking that Mr. James is surprised by the positive economic results of less regulation and lower taxes.

A judge ordered federal emergency officials to extend vouchers for temporary hotel housing for nearly 1,700 Puerto Rican hurricane evacuees, saying ending the program could cause irreparable harm. Saturday night's decision came shortly after civil rights group LatinoJustice PRLDEF filed a lawsuit seeking relief for the Puerto Ricans, whose federal housing assistance vouchers were set to expire at midnight Sunday, meaning the evacuees could have been evicted from the hotels. The order says the agency cannot end its Transitional Sheltering Assistance program until at least midnight on Tuesday. The organization is pushing to let families stay another six months. U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin of Massachusetts wrote that ending the program would drain other public resources.
But it would concern me a lot if they are expanding the nuclear program as they meet with the president. I don't want a war with North Korea. A lot of people would be killed and hurt. CHUCK TODD:

The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said. Carney said the impact from the president’s use of import tariffs against major trading partners including the EU and China, alongside their retaliatory measures, was already being seen through measures of global exports and manufacturing in recent weeks. “There are some tentative signs that this more hostile and uncertain trading environment may be dampening activity,” he said. Surveys of factory output in the US and the eurozone earlier this week showed firms were facing higher prices as a consequence of the import tariffs, as well as American manufacturers having the longest delivery delays on record.
Those factories are the core of an American operation that employs about 136,000 people, but they're also dependent on components sourced overseas for reasons of cost or availability. About 70 percent of the parts in a U.S.-built Camry, the country's best-selling car, come from domestic suppliers. Toyota on June 27 said that Trump's threatened 25 percent tariff on automotive imports would add $1,800 to the price of each sedan. The carmaker's warning of the dangers of tit-for-tat tariffs was just one of many. German lighting manufacturer Osram Licht's shares plunged 22 percent Thursday after it announced a weaker outlook due to trade tensions.
But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said. Tackett said he's concerned about children, especially in Eastern Kentucky, which has a higher rate of Medicaid patients and some of the state's worst oral health. "I have no problem with them regulating the adults that are on Medicaid," Tackett said. "If they are young and healthy, they should be out working or doing something.
Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups. According to the New York Times, the Supreme court’s decision will affect these left-wing groups and causes. “If the progressive movement is a navy, they’re trying to take out our aircraft carriers,” said Ben Wikler, of MoveOn.org, the Times reported. However, progressive groups are optimistic that the loss of union funds will be compensated for with grass-roots activism.
And that's really been the case all along. He's publicly supported Pruitt through all of this. And for Pruitt's part, you know, he was pretty unapologetic in his resignation letter. He has and continues to blame all of this, you know, perceived brouhaha on environmentalists and the media, people who were upset about the work that he's doing at EPA.
Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. — President Donald Trump launched a sustained attack Thursday on Sen. Elizabeth Warren — a leading potential 2020 rival — during a midterm campaign rally here. Reviving his "Pocahontas" nickname for the Massachusetts Democrat, Trump asked his audience to imagine him on a debate stage challenging Warren to submit to genetic testing to prove that she has Native American ancestors.
If that happens there would be plenty of credit to go around. Certainly President Moon would deserve great credit for his unprecedented initiative in engaging the North. Certainly Kim Jong Un would deserve great credit for seeing that he could achieve his country’s security without nuclear weapons. And certainly Trump would deserve great credit for seeing the possibility of a peaceful solution where many of his advisers saw military action as the only option. In the meantime, we have much hard work ahead.
In a statement, Cleveland police said it is "not our policy to discuss tactics or personnel resources" regarding whether they would be increasing security Wednesday. The statement concluded with “We continue to rely on the public to be our extra set of eyes and ears, to be vigilant, and when they "see something, say something." In Washington, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday that "President Trump commends the work of the DOJ and the FBI in helping stop this would-be attacker."

"Congressman Jordan never saw any abuse, never heard about any abuse, and never had any abuse reported to him during his time as a coach at Ohio State," Ian Fury, Jordan's spokesman, said in a statement. "He has not been contacted by investigators about the matter but will assist them in any way they ask, because if what is alleged is true, the victims deserve a full investigation and justice." In April, university officials announced they were investigating accusations that Dr. Richard Strauss, who died in 2005, had abused young wrestlers for more than two decades, starting in the mid-1970s. Jordan, who has served in the House since 2007, repeatedly has said he only learned about the alleged abuse this spring, when former students began speaking out. On Tuesday there were conflicting claims Jordan that had been contacted by the university's law firm regarding the investigation.
That will allow Trump to argue that his tough approach to trade is paying off. There are reasons why the US economy is currently strong, but none of them have anything to do with tariffs on imports. In part, it is the lagged effect of a buoyant global economy in 2017; in part it is explained by tax cuts and the stimulus still being provided by only gently rising interest rates. Mickey Levy, chief US economist for Berenberg, says Trump’s deregulation agenda has been a factor in boosting America’s underlying growth rate. Evidence from Barack Obama’s presidency shows how protectionist policies can backfire.

Legalize the possession and sale of up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana for personal, recreational use for people over the age of 21. A person could keep up to 10 ounces of marijuana at home.

Split those revenues, with 35 percent going to K-12 education, 35 percent to roads, 15 percent to the communities that allow marijuana businesses in their communities and 15 percent to counties where marijuana business are located. Allow communities to decide whether they’ll allow marijuana businesses in their towns.

Has the Trump administration made it clear exactly what it expects the North Koreans should give up under this joint statement that the two leaders released last month when they met in Singapore? And that's where a lot of the debate or the controversy comes around because what the United States has claimed it wants is complete denuclearization. And the North Koreans sort of say they'll do that, but it's pretty clear they don't mean the same thing.

People who use home genetic testing kits to unlock the mysteries of their ancestry tend to “cherry pick” the results, relying on preconceived biases to embrace some of the findings while disregarding others, new research suggests. Home genetic testing has become a multibillion-dollar industry that has seen millions of people around the world sign up for swab kits in hopes of uncovering the secrets hidden in their genomes. Researchers at Vancouver’s University of British Columbia focused on how the results shape perceptions of race and ethnicity. They interviewed 100 Americans from various ethnic and racial backgrounds who had taken the tests, returning to them 18 months later to examine whether the tests had gradually shifted how they saw their identity. The findings, published this week in the American Journal of Sociology, showed that most of participants – 59% – did not alter their views on their identity, despite receiving new information from the tests.

People are taking the clip (which has reached over 187,000 views) as a teaser for an upcoming project. Even his followers are getting excited, including Pamela Anderson, who tweeted her support. I can’t wait for this ... all in good fun on Sacha’s part ... but the other seems sinister, cruel and over reactive.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
Even though he received what he called a “shellacking” in the 2010 midterms, and even though the GOP made unprecedented political gains during his tenure, President Obama was always convinced the country was behind him. As Mara Liasson wrote for NPR in 2016: “During Obama's eight years in office, the Democrats have lost more House, Senate, state legislative and governors seats than under any other president.” She noted that the Obama legacy includes “one huge failure: a diminished Democratic Party.”
In 2013, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., invoked the so-called “nuclear option,” discarding traditional filibuster protections for the minority party in favor of requiring only a simple majority to approve judicial and executive branch nominees. He carved out an exception for people put forward for the Supreme Court. The next year – with CNN describing President Obama as an “unpopular president limping through his second term” – Republicans reclaimed control of the Senate. As a result of that achievement, President Obama’s chances of securing a liberal majority on the high court all but disappeared.
Though they won’t admit it, Democrats are suffering continued fallout from the arrogance of the Obama White House. Liberals are furious that President Trump will have the opportunity to appoint another justice to the Supreme Court, thus cementing a conservative majority for the foreseeable future. Moreover, liberals are upset that the Trump administration may have convinced Justice Anthony Kennedy to recently announce his retirement, viewing that effort as dirty pool. That Kennedy, age 81, is nobody’s fool – and is unlikely to have been manipulated – appears irrelevant. The real offense, which actually merits outrage from the left, is that President Obama did not convince liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to retire during the many years that Democrats controlled the Senate.
He fell behind on the rental payments on the condo he was getting on the cheap and eventually had to be evicted and the locks were changed.
Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. Teachers are also running a ballot measure campaign that would tax the highest income earners for an additional $690 million to spend on schools. “Regardless of political parties, we need people to make a decision about what’s happening in the classroom,” said Marisol Garcia, vice president of the Arizona Education Association. “To limit ourselves and to say ‘only these people are going to support us’ is just not true.”
Teachers can be at a disadvantage compared to wealthier candidates, who tend to have built-in networks of potential donors.

3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.
The organization is pushing to let families stay another six months. U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin of Massachusetts wrote that ending the program would drain other public resources. He also said the evidence showed problems with the Federal Emergency Management Agency's efforts to notify and provide transitional help for the hurricane refugees. "The irreparable harm to the plaintiffs is obvious and overwhelming; tomorrow morning they will be evicted and homeless since by definition each plaintiff's home was rendered uninhabitable by the hurricane in Puerto Rico," he wrote in his decision. FEMA declined to comment on the lawsuit, but the Orlando Sentinel reports the agency confirmed it was working to notify hotels to extend the aid until July 5 to comply with the order.
Peach Wars: Southern States Spar Over Which Has The Most Juice
It's a juicy rivalry complete with peach emoji and a well-timed "bless your heart." The agriculture departments in Georgia and South Carolina sparred on Twitter this week over which of them really deserves the title of Peach State. It started with a tweet from South Carolina's Department of Agriculture — an account off to a feisty start since it was created in June. The department claimed that South Carolina harvests three times more peaches than Georgia does.

But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said. Tackett said he's concerned about children, especially in Eastern Kentucky, which has a higher rate of Medicaid patients and some of the state's worst oral health. "I have no problem with them regulating the adults that are on Medicaid," Tackett said. "If they are young and healthy, they should be out working or doing something.
"Well I hope they keep thinking about it," Trump said. "Because they’re going to get beaten so badly. You know ICE, these are the guys that go in and take MS-13, and they take them out. Because they're much tougher than MS-13, like by a factor of 10. "And these are the ones – you get rid of ICE, you’re going to have a country that you’re going to be afraid to walk out of your house," he said.
Trump Narrows His Options For New Supreme Court Justice President Trump has reportedly narrowed his list of Supreme Court nominees down to three. NPR's Nina Totenberg talks to Ailsa Chang about who is on that list — and what we know about them.
Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.
In the lead-up to the upcoming NATO summit in Brussels, President Donald Trump has reportedly sent “sharply worded letters” to the leaders of several NATO allies, escalating his long-simmering feud with the military alliance. The New York Times reported Monday that the letters, sent last month to leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Prime Minister Charles Michel of Belgium, rebuked NATO allies for not spending enough on their own defense ― a criticism that Trump has repeatedly leveled against other alliance members. The president also suggested in the letters that the U.S. would consider reducing its military commitment globally if its allies don’t ramp up spending, reported the Times. In his letter to Merkel, Trump reportedly wrote: “There is growing frustration in the United States that some allies have not stepped up as promised. The United States continues to devote more resources to the defense of Europe when the Continent’s economy, including Germany’s, are doing well and security challenges abound.
In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners. Alas, he is wasting his time trying to shift the views of the Democratic Party, which has become ever more left-wing, if not outright socialist. I think it is time for Mr. James to become a Republican. Guy Randolph

It’s shocking that Mr. James is surprised by the positive economic results of less regulation and lower taxes.
The president told Fox News that he believes his nominee will get some support from Democrats. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, an abortion rights supporter, is considered one of the key votes on a nominee. She said she wouldn't vote for someone who would overturn Roe v. Wade. "A candidate who would overturn Roe would not be acceptable," she said Sunday on ABC's This Week. Collins, who has previously bucked party lines on other key issues such as health care, said she plans to have an in-depth conversation with the nominee.
Hamilton, the Republican state lawmaker who beat the incumbent Karnes, won with a mix of support from teachers and other unions. While Karnes sparred with teachers during the strike, Hamilton took a moderate position. He aligned with teachers unions by opposing state right-to-work legislation and the proposed repeal of prevailing wage laws for public construction projects. The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.
Did he display these tendencies? He was a fairly good mayor. He used his term as mayor many times during the campaign [to show] how he was more pragmatic rather than authoritarian. And in that he is correct. He was also fairly popular as mayor and ended his term with a very respectable approval rating.
It never helped my self-image. It only made me despise myself more and more. But I never took even a moment to question my assigned gender. Many trans people talk about knowing from a very young age, but I was never given the tools I needed to really examine my identity. When I spoke to Christian, a trans man from New York, about his path to authentic selfhood, he expressed a similar sentiment.
There is reason to believe that might happen. The foundation, in conjunction with UIC, recently held its Chicago Community Conversation on the West Side. The event at UIC drew nearly 350 community activists, representing a broad range of interests, to exchange ideas about some of the city’s most pressing issues. Like most foundation forums, it was a spectacular event, drawing everyone from MacArthur Foundation “genius grant” winner Rami Nashashibi to philanthropic organizations to Tony- and Grammy-winning performer Daveed Diggs. Notably absent, though, was Obama.
But he said Pitts's extensive conversations with the undercover FBI employee, combined with a criminal record that included charges for assault, domestic violence and carrying a concealed weapon, gave agents cause for concern. He said the FBI arrested Pitts after he met with the undercover employee for a final time Sunday. "We don't have the luxury of hoping that an individual decides not to harm someone or get others to act, especially when his continued repeated intentions were to do just that," Anthony said. The FBI had been tipped to Pitts as far back as 2015, when he sent a private Facebook message to "The Craig Sewing Show," a California-based political commentary show, saying, "The USA will be destroy.
NEW YORK — House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) has referred 15 individuals, including longtime Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal, for possible “open setting” testimony in the ongoing Russia investigation. The list was sent to House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA). Many of the names are tied to the discredited anti-Trump dossier produced by the controversial Fusion GPS firm, which was paid for its dossier work by both Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) via the Perkins Coie lawfirm. Indeed, Perkins Coie attorney Marc E. Elias, who reportedly was involved in arranging the payments that resulted in the dossier, made the Nunes list. As did Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson.
That leaves the broader theory that Deutsche Bank’s loans to Trump were somehow illicit. Yet this, too, doesn’t add up. How would the White House leverage that information against Anthony Kennedy? Trump would have to threaten to reveal it to the public—but that would incriminate him, too. Assume, for the sake of argument, that Justin Kennedy did commit a white-collar crime in his dealings with Trump.

The U.S. economy continues to show strength in the wake of tax reform and deregulation, but the downside of robust growth is that Donald Trump thinks this means he can dabble at trade war with impunity. He ought to look at the signs that growth would be even stronger if not for his border-tax brawls. The latest evidence came in the minutes released Thursday from the Federal Open Market Committee’s June meeting. Fed district presidents from around the U.S. reported evidence of strong growth, but along the way came this warning:

“However, many District contacts expressed concern about the possible adverse effects of tariffs and other proposed trade restrictions, both domestically and abroad, on future investment activity; contacts in some Districts indicated that plans for capital spending had been scaled back or postponed as a result of uncertainty over trade policy.”
The minutes continued: “Contacts in the steel and aluminum industries expected higher prices as a result of the tariffs on these products but had not planned any new investments to increase capacity. Conditions in the agricultural sector reportedly improved somewhat, but contacts were concerned about the effect of potentially higher tariffs on their exports.”
These reports are from the economy’s ground floor, not the Beltway penthouse.
National Guardsmen assigned to Operation Guardian Support rescued a Border Patrol K-9 agent and saved the animal’s life. The K-9 and his handler tracked down a group of 11 illegal immigrants before the dog fell victim to the heat. Members of a National Guard helicopter crew responded to a call for assistance from a Border Patrol team after a K-9 agent experienced a heat-related medical emergency. The K-9 became overheated while tracking a group of 11 illegal aliens in the desert and harsh terrain near Arivaca, Arizona, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials. Agents in the field contacted the Tucson Sector’s Tactical Operation Center and reported that a K-9 agent became overheated.

LONDON — Over the past century American and British troops have fought side-by-side in two World Wars, Korea and the conflicts in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan. But some lawmakers and experts in the United Kingdom are warning that the British military could soon be seen as irrelevant by the United States unless it receives a colossal funding boost. "There is a concern that the U.K. is falling ever further behind and becoming even more useless from a U.S. point of view," said Andrew Dorman, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a think tank in London.
Amlo has said that a crackdown on corruption will mean that his administration will have more money at its disposal as it will stop millions of pesos being embezzled.
The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.
In what ways should these concerns shape congressional expectations about transparency of the nominee vetting process and the standards for recusal in cases involving President Trump’s legal affairs? Consider first the not-unlikely prospect of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who has developed a robust view of presidential immunity from legal process fully consistent with some of the more aggressive positions of the president and his legal team. Kavanaugh has written that:
Congress might consider a law exempting a President—while in office—from criminal prosecution and investigation, including from questioning by criminal prosecutors or defense counsel. Criminal investigations targeted at or revolving around a President are inevitably politicized by both their supporters and critics. As I have written before, “no Attorney General or special counsel will have the necessary credibility to avoid the inevitable charges that he is politically motivated—whether in favor of the President or against him, depending on the individual leading the investigation and its results.” The indictment and trial of a sitting President, moreover, would cripple the federal government, rendering it unable to function with credibility in either the international or domestic arenas.
Khalaf spent time in a camp for displaced people in northern Iraq before eventually relocating to Germany, where she lives now. Ahmed Khudida Burjus, the deputy director of Yazda, a U.S.-based Yazidi rights group, says around 7,000 women and girls were captured and sold into slavery, with nearly half eventually escaping. In Kocho alone, at least 500 men and boys were killed, and 800 women and girls taken away. The group has documented at least 54 mass graves of Yazidis, but says a lack of resources has delayed the exhumation of the remains, and that there may be more graves yet to be discovered. Over the past three years, Syrian and Iraqi forces have gradually driven IS out of nearly all the territory it once held.
But it would concern me a lot if they are expanding the nuclear program as they meet with the president. I don't want a war with North Korea. A lot of people would be killed and hurt. CHUCK TODD:

That may be less true in cases where U.S. companies engage in businesses with a ready substitute. Chinese leader Xi Jinping recently hinted that European and Asian conglomerates might soon find themselves benefiting as China punches back against the U.S.

In turn, that means American firms in China could soon find their new product models at the bottom of the regulatory pile for things like safety approvals, or their state-owned Chinese partners might shift resources toward European joint ventures instead. China has a history of this sort of bureaucratic malfeasance, with its consumers often helping out.
This is just terrible timing all around." Medicaid, an $11 billion, state-federal health plan in Kentucky, covers 1.4 million people, about 600,000 of them children. The federal government provides about 80 percent of the state's Medicaid funds. The cuts to dental and vision benefits were supposed to affect only able-bodied adults, mostly those added to Medicaid under an expansion authorized through the Affordable Care Act.
"Unlike our forerunners in 1968, those of us living today have access to something they didn't," said Mary Eberstadt, a widely published Catholic writer, "50 years of sociological, psychological, medical, and other evidence about the revolution's fallout." Some of the lines in Humanae Vitae, when stripped of mid-20th century cultural references, find echoes in contemporary concerns about nonconsensual sexual relations. "A man who grows accustomed to the use of contraceptive methods may forget the reverence due to a woman," the pope wrote, "... and reduce her to a mere instrument of his own desires." "This document that has been so controversial and in many places reviled," Eberstadt says, "actually called the shots on what the future would look like better than any other single source I could think of." Revisionist views of the 1968 encyclical have even taken hold among some Catholics who have not abided by its teaching.
Calls for an Iran without its current “dictatorial regime” were met with strengthened hope during the annual “free Iran” rally held in Paris this past weekend by the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), an exiled Paris-based Iranian opposition group allied with the Mujaheddin-e-Khalq (MEK). The rally, which event organizers said saw more than 100,000 attendees, took place at the Villepinte Congress Center, outside of Paris on Saturday. A series of panel discussions ranging in topic from women’s rights to denuclearization took place on Friday. The Guardian reported there was “a crowd of about 4,000, many of them refugees and young eastern Europeans who had been bussed in to attend the rally in return for a weekend trip to Paris.”
Distinguished speakers at Saturday’s event included former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal attorney; New Mexico’s former Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson; former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich; former Sen. Robert Torricelli (D-NJ); former FBI Director Louis Freeh; former Homeland Security Adviser Frances Townsend; and former U.S. Army chief of staff Gen. George Casey.
Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
Nearly 600 more retail jobs are to go in the UK as the Jacques Vert, Windsmoor and Precis department store brands are wound down by administrators. Administrators said they had failed to find a buyer for Calvetron Brands, which had been restructured following a rescue deal last summer. The business entered administration in May and had already shed more than 400 jobs before Wednesday’s announcement. The latest retail job losses come as more than 30,000 jobs are at risk in the UK following mass closure announcements by major chains including House of Fraser, New Look and Marks & Spencer. Retailers are suffering from rising costs and the switch to online shopping just as hard-pressed consumers rein in spending.
Crimes such as robbery remain rampant across Venezuela amid the country’s dire economic and humanitarian crisis, leading growing numbers of people to turn to violence merely to ensure survival. Kidnappings, armed robberies, and violent attacks are now commonplace. Venezuela is widely considered one of the most dangerous destinations in the world. As noted by El Nacional, “There are many travelers who have been stripped of money, luggage, and vehicles on the Caracas-La Guaira highway, especially at night and early morning when the road is little traveled and lacks surveillance.”
The doctors were present in Venezuela as part of an agreement between the two countries. Venezuela typically pays for the doctors in vast quantities of oil, an initiative that started under Hugo Chávez and Fidel Castro.
The definition of drug dealer
More and more, trouble is following fellow drug users, friends and relatives of those dying from overdoses. With the country's opioid crisis widening – having killed more people in 2016, for instance, than the deadliest year of the AIDs epidemic – bystanders to fatal overdoses are increasingly becoming criminal defendants. Pennsylvania prosecutors in Delaware County who are pursuing the case against Santa Barbara declined an interview request. But among the criminal charges they are pressing against her is drug delivery resulting in death, a first-degree felony carrying the maximum punishment of 20 to 40 years in prison. In Pennsylvania, the number of people charged with this version of third-degree murder from an accidental overdose went from 15 in 2013 to 205 last year.
Practice is only one of Deborah Glass’s 125 recommendations not accepted by Victorian government
Female prisoners in Victoria are still subject to “abusive” routine strip searches, a state government watchdog says. The Victorian ombudsman, Deborah Glass, said the government has failed to adopt a recommendation from her 2015 report into the prison system that called for an end to the searches. “Why has the government not accepted my recommendation to stop the abusive practice of routinely strip-searching women prisoners – in fact, the only recommendation out of 125 not accepted?” she asked on Wednesday. The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year.

Tesla could use a lighter moment. It has had a 2018 filled with ups and downs. In May, Consumer Reports initially did not recommend the electric vehicle giant’s Model 3, its first car priced for mainstream buyers, in part because of long stopping distances, only to see the magazine relent after it flashed software to cars that improved them. Last month, Tesla topped a list of best-selling electric vehicles in the United States, selling three of the five most popular cars. And this week, Tesla announced that it had reached Musk's goal of manufacturing 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week.
The woman who was flown back Thursday said she didn't know if she'd try it again. First, she needed to find out when her partner would be coming back. He was still detained in Texas. She borrowed a mobile phone to call a friend to get a ride to her small brick house that she thought she had left forever, a house containing the memories of her missing children, in a town under the grip of a gang. Asked who was waiting for her there, she looked bereft and answered weakly: "No one."
BREAKING: @NEAToday President @Lily_NEA reacts to radical ruling by #SCOTUS: "We are living in a system that is rigged to benefit special interests & billionaires, all at the expense of working people." FULL STATEMENT: https://t.co/uE4j5lQPGh #Janus #JanusvAFSCME #Union — NEA Public Relations (@NEAMedia) June 27, 2018
A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.
And when we discovered oil, it's not like we, you know, twirled our mustaches and said, mwahahaha (ph), I will destroy the planet. Instead we used it to do amazing things - heating homes, you know, making internal combustion engines. So triggering climate change was not our fault, but not doing something about it now that we've recognized it, not switching energy infrastructures now that we've recognized it - yeah, not only would that be our fault, but it would be our folly because what it would mean is - is that that would be the reason why we didn't make it across the other side. Some civilizations make it, and some don't. And that would be the reason why we wouldn't make it.
A prominent exit poll predicted his party allies were poised to score big victories in congressional races, possibly winning absolute majorities in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. Lopez Obrador, who campaigned on vows to transform Mexico and oust the "mafia of power" ruling the country, rode widespread voter anger and discontent with the governing Institutional Revolution Party, or PRI, of President Enrique Pena Nieto and had led opinion polls since the beginning of the campaign. The PRI, which dominated Mexican politics for nearly the entire 20th century and recaptured the presidency in 2012, was set to suffer heavy losses not just for the presidency but in other races as well. In brief remarks at a hotel in central Mexico City, Lopez Obrador called for reconciliation after a polarizing campaign and promised profound change but with respect for the law and constitutional order. "I confess that I have a legitimate ambition: I want to go down in history as a good president of Mexico," said Lopez Obrador, who had lost in the previous two presidential elections.
Although he gave no indication he was about to order up military plans, he pointed to what he considered past cases of successful gunboat diplomacy in the region, according to the official, like the invasions of Panama and Grenada in the 1980s. The idea, despite his aides' best attempts to shoot it down, would nonetheless persist in the president's head. The next day, Aug. 11, Trump alarmed friends and foes alike with talk of a "military option" to remove Maduro from power. The public remarks were initially dismissed in U.S. policy circles as the sort of martial bluster people have come to expect from the reality TV star turned commander in chief.

The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.

"We are driven to the conclusion that it does."
On this much police and activist South Side priest Michael Pfleger can agree: Saturday morning’s anti-violence march on the Dan Ryan Expressway is all about danger. Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.
The proposal would:
Legalize the possession and sale of up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana for personal, recreational use for people over the age of 21. A person could keep up to 10 ounces of marijuana at home. Tax marijuana sales with a 10 percent excise tax at the retail level as well as the state's 6 percent sales tax. Split those revenues, with 35 percent going to K-12 education, 35 percent to roads, 15 percent to the communities that allow marijuana businesses in their communities and 15 percent to counties where marijuana business are located. Allow communities to decide whether they’ll allow marijuana businesses in their towns.

America has a love-hate relationship with Walmart (WMT), sparking debates about whether the giant retailer helps or hurts the country's economy. It turns out that Walmart might be helping one segment that's overlooked in the debate: low-income families who struggle with food insecurity, according to new research from economists at Georgia State University, Nairobi's Columbia Global Centers and Samford University, and funded by the University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Some municipalities have sought to block or restrict Walmart from opening up within their borders, often on the grounds that a new Walmart could hurt local businesses. The researchers said they wanted to come at the question of Walmart's impact from another direction: "Are barriers to Walmart's entry at odds with the goal of eliminating hunger?"
Under the sanctions, any assets belonging to the three officials in the United States are blocked and U.S. citizens are prohibited from engaging in transactions with them or entities they own or control, the Treasury said in a statement. “The violence perpetrated by the government of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega against the Nicaraguan people and the efforts of those close to the Ortega regime to illicitly enrich themselves is deeply disturbing and completely unacceptable,” Sigal Mandelker, undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a statement. The United States accused Madriz of ordering the Nicaraguan police to set fire to a house in the capital, Managua, killing six people, including two children. It said police also asked gang leaders in Nicaragua to attack anti-government protesters, fired on and killed peaceful protesters. Briones ordered attacks against elderly and young people protesting peacefully, ordered violent attacks against anti-government marchers and beat protesters and stole money from Managua municipal projects, according to the Treasury.
In the lead-up to the upcoming NATO summit in Brussels, President Donald Trump has reportedly sent “sharply worded letters” to the leaders of several NATO allies, escalating his long-simmering feud with the military alliance. The New York Times reported Monday that the letters, sent last month to leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Prime Minister Charles Michel of Belgium, rebuked NATO allies for not spending enough on their own defense ― a criticism that Trump has repeatedly leveled against other alliance members. The president also suggested in the letters that the U.S. would consider reducing its military commitment globally if its allies don’t ramp up spending, reported the Times. In his letter to Merkel, Trump reportedly wrote: “There is growing frustration in the United States that some allies have not stepped up as promised. The United States continues to devote more resources to the defense of Europe when the Continent’s economy, including Germany’s, are doing well and security challenges abound.

David Shulkin, Veterans Affairs Secretary - 28 March 2018
A doctor, he had served as undersecretary of veterans affairs for health under Barack Obama. President Trump had hailed him as "fantastic" when appointing him, and the Senate gave him the only 100-0 confirmation of the Trump team.
Even Pruitt’s own staff had begun to sour on him, with many worrying that their future career prospects would be damaged by their association with Pruitt’s tenure. Each scandal seemed more damning than the last. Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.

While other data on Thursday showed private payrolls rising less than expected last month and a surprise increase in new applications for unemployment benefits last week, overall labor market conditions continue to tighten. The labor market is considered to be near or at full employment, with the jobless rate at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent. The unemployment rate has dropped by three-tenths of a percentage point this year and is near the Federal Reserve’s forecast of 3.6 percent by the end of this year.
The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. Teachers are also running a ballot measure campaign that would tax the highest income earners for an additional $690 million to spend on schools. “Regardless of political parties, we need people to make a decision about what’s happening in the classroom,” said Marisol Garcia, vice president of the Arizona Education Association. “To limit ourselves and to say ‘only these people are going to support us’ is just not true.”
Teachers can be at a disadvantage compared to wealthier candidates, who tend to have built-in networks of potential donors.
WASHINGTON—The number of Americans filing applications for new unemployment benefits rose last week but remained near historic lows. Initial jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs across the U.S., increased by 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 231,000 in the week ended June 30, the Labor Department said Thursday. Claims also rose in the week ended June 23. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected 225,000 new claims last week.
“That was a very sad day for the country when that vote was cast,” Trump said in June. But Republican lawmakers dispute arguments suggesting their efforts to undo ObamaCare have been totally fruitless. “We eliminated the individual mandate that said that people had to buy government-approved insurance,” said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo. “In a sense, it blew a big hole in ObamaCare.”
There’s a potential electoral landmine ahead for Republicans hoping to keep their majorities in the House and Senate, though: premium increases. “We’re going to get another round right before the election, which is something the GOP is nervous about,” said John C. Goodman, president of the Goodman Institute.

Portland police told KOIN there would be "significant law enforcement precense" downtown. KOIN reports that police were already dressed in riot gear before the 4 p.m. start time. The protest was similar to June 3 demonstrations near City Hall in Portland, Oregon, which led to four arrests after clashes between right-wing groups and antifa. Thousands of people protested earlier Saturday against the the Trump administration's family separations and across the Columbia River in Vancouver, Washington. Hundreds of rallies were held nationwide to protest President Trump's "zero tolerance" immigration policy.
Bishop John Bauerschmidt, who oversees the Middle Tennessee region of the church, stands firmly by his decision not to authorize their use, nor allow clergy within his diocese to officiate the religious ceremonies or permit the weddings on church property. In doing so, the bishop says he is being faithful to his job of guarding the discipline, faith and unity of the church.

"The teaching that Christian marriage is between a man and a woman is reasonable, traditional, and scriptural," Bauerschmidt said in an email. "There really is nothing remarkable about a Christian bishop who holds to this teaching." While Bishops can place limitations on the use of the marriage liturgies, they must refer couples to a willing diocese if they do not authorize them.

Over the fireplace at Mingo Creek Craft Distillers, a whiskey purveyor in the small town of Washington, Pennsylvania, a portrait of Alexander Hamilton hangs upside down. With snowy hair and a black velvet jacket, Hamilton wears an impassive look that might be described as hauteur. In 1791, to pay off debts the newly formed United States incurred during the revolutionary war, Hamilton imposed the first federal tax on the people of the region. By taxing their most lucrative product, whiskey, he became what he is here today: a villain representing the excesses of the federal government. The town of Washington is only a six-hour drive from Manhattan, but it’s a world away from the Broadway stage where Hamilton, clad in snug white knickers, enjoys a better reputation.

Cuts to music A-levels and GCSEs could endanger the supply of teachers and performers and make the subject elitist again
This time last year the young cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason was awaiting his A-level results, unaware that within 12 months he would be a world sensation. The student at Trinity school, a comprehensive in one of the less advantaged parts of Nottingham, achieved his predicted A* for music and is now at the Royal Academy of Music. That’s where he took the personal phone call from Meghan Markle at Kensington Palace inviting him to play at her wedding, after Prince Harry had heard him play at a charity event last summer. It’s a wonderful success story for state education, but it is one that is, sadly, becoming harder to replicate. Sheku’s school, along with many others across the country, is being forced to make budget cuts – and music is often first in line.

Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey.

WASHINGTON — Long before Viktor Vekselberg was tied to a scandal over the president and a porn star, the Russian oligarch had been positioning himself to extend his influence in the United States. Working closely with an American cousin who heads the New York investment management firm Columbus Nova, Vekselberg backed a $1.6 million lobbying campaign to aid Russian interests in Washington. His cousin Andrew Intrater served as CEO of a Vekselberg company on that project, and the two men have collaborated on numerous other investments involving Vekselberg's extensive holdings. Now, Intrater's investment firm is wrestling with the fallout from financial sanctions the U.S. Treasury Department lodged in April against Vekselberg, one of a group of oligarchs tied to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Columbus Nova has insisted it only managed Vekselberg's vast assets.

In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners. Alas, he is wasting his time trying to shift the views of the Democratic Party, which has become ever more left-wing, if not outright socialist. I think it is time for Mr. James to become a Republican. Guy Randolph
Savannah, Ga.
It’s shocking that Mr. James is surprised by the positive economic results of less regulation and lower taxes.
The economy has added an average 207,000 jobs a month this year after a blowout number of 223,000 in May. Economists predict that 195,000 jobs were added in June. Unemployment stands at 3.8%, the lowest rate since 2000. If it dips to 3.7%, it will be the lowest since 1969.
Though they won’t admit it, Democrats are suffering continued fallout from the arrogance of the Obama White House. Liberals are furious that President Trump will have the opportunity to appoint another justice to the Supreme Court, thus cementing a conservative majority for the foreseeable future. Moreover, liberals are upset that the Trump administration may have convinced Justice Anthony Kennedy to recently announce his retirement, viewing that effort as dirty pool. That Kennedy, age 81, is nobody’s fool – and is unlikely to have been manipulated – appears irrelevant. The real offense, which actually merits outrage from the left, is that President Obama did not convince liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to retire during the many years that Democrats controlled the Senate.
— MINING: The EPA said last year that it won't require mining companies to prove they have the financial resources to clean up pollution, an Obama-era rule stemming from a long history of pollution spilling from abandoned mines into streams.

For new vehicles, that means an average of about 30 miles per gallon instead of rising to 36 mpg by 2025 as Obama's EPA proposed. — OIL AND GAS: More than a dozen states are suing the EPA for failing to take action against leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, from oil and natural gas wells.

Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.

Alas, he is wasting his time trying to shift the views of the Democratic Party, which has become ever more left-wing, if not outright socialist. I think it is time for Mr. James to become a Republican. Guy Randolph
Savannah, Ga.
It’s shocking that Mr. James is surprised by the positive economic results of less regulation and lower taxes.
He said he supports the project and wants to see it succeed “more than anybody.”
Moore said he knows Obama dating back to the former president’s days as an Illinois state senator running for Congress, driving with him to community meetings and even going as a surrogate for him once or twice.
The police, some wearing hoods, took Cubias to a darkened area, jerked his head back by grabbing his long hair and told him they could make him disappear if he didn't inform on gang activities, Cubias said in an interview. He had nothing to tell them because thus far, he's managed to keep his distance from the gang that controls his neighborhood. "I was afraid, because I was alone," Cubias recalled of his encounter with the police. "I asked God to help me."

Melania Trump earned at least $100,000 from an unusual deal with the Getty Images photo agency. Media organizations (including Yahoo News, NBC News and Marie Claire magazine) indirectly paid the Trump family — despite a requirement that the photos be used only in positive stories.
Ethiopia's government has fired five prison officials as it confronts allegations of torture and other abuses of inmates as part of a wave of reforms. Among those fired is the federal prison chief who until recently defended the treatment of inmates as "fair." The firings came ahead of a new Human Rights Watch report released Thursday that documents widespread arbitrary detention, torture, rape and humiliation over several years in Ethiopia's eastern Somali region. It urges new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to investigate the "horrific" situation. Abiy has admitted that security forces have tortured people but has yet to "tackle Ethiopia's culture of impunity and ensure accountability," said Felix Horne, senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Corporate America couldn’t hire Republican lobbyists fast enough after President Donald Trump’s election gave the GOP unified control of Washington. Now there are signs that Democrats are back in demand. Companies and trade groups are trying to hire congressional staffers with ties to influential House Democrats four months ahead of the midterm elections, in which Democrats are expected to pick up seats and potentially retake control of the House. Lobbyists are helping their clients meet with the Democrats who would become committee chairs if the party does win back the chamber. And trade groups are talking to members about what to expect from a Democratic takeover.
Azar said that once children and parents are reunited, they will be held in DHS custody. He added that he plans to request additional time from the court "to ensure that we can do the job that we believe is necessary to protect the children in our care." Rose and NPR's Tom Bowman reported last month that the Department of Defense is planning to build "tent encampments on two military bases in Texas to house migrant families apprehended at the border."
Watts was transported to a nearby hospital, where 85 to 90 percent of his body was found to have been burned, Georgia State Patrol told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Authorities said Watts, upset with the federal agency designated to aid veterans, attached a homemade incendiary device and fireworks to his body before pouring liquid on himself. He then ignited the fluid. VETERAN PROTESTING TREATMENT BY VA SETS HIMSELF ON FIRE NEAR GEORGIA STATE CAPITOL, POLICE SAY
"It looks like a veteran that was disgruntled with the VA did a personal protest in front of the Capitol which involved gasoline and some fireworks,” Commissioner Mark McDonough, of the Georgia Department of Public Safety, said. The commissioner added a Capitol trooper "actually put him out with his fire extinguisher."
That came on the heels of 0.9 percent drop in March, the first monthly drop since July of 2017. Total private construction rose 0.3 percent, with residential projects up 0.8 percent in May. New single-family home construction rose 0.6 percent and the volatile apartment building sector jumped 1.6 percent. Private, non-residential building fell 0.3 percent. Economists are forecasting that construction spending will contribute to overall growth this year even though interest rates are rising.
"Please join me in praying for the injured and their families. We must come together to condemn this vile act." Megan Schwab, who works with the International Rescue Committee in Boise, said the organization was working to provide temporary housing, counseling and other support to those affected by the attack. For some of the refugees living at the complex, the attack revived traumatic memories of the war and violence they had fled. The blood from the stabbings reminded residents Ibod Hasn and Thado Aip of the terror they left in Somalia, they said on Sunday.
Hope Life Center in western Illinois provides unplanned pregnancy counseling and ultrasounds for about five to 10 women a week, with a mission to “erase abortion from Illinois one woman and one child at time,” according to its website. So Executive Director Debbie Case was alarmed by a change last year in the state's so-called right-of-conscience law, requiring health care providers to inform pregnant patients of all available medical options, including abortion. She said the pregnancy center even shut down for part of 2017 because its physician feared potential repercussions of violating the law, which is now temporarily blocked by the courts. Case and other anti-abortion advocates across the state hailed Tuesday’s ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court against a similar law in California on First Amendment grounds, hoping the decision will strengthen their legal battle in Illinois. “We’re definitely encouraged,” said Case, whose center is in Sterling, about two hours west of Chicago.
'We’re going to run different'
His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
President Trump had suggested lifting the prohibition, which environmentalists charge would raise levels of ground ozone during warmer months, during his campaign for the White House. Following the news of Mr. Pruitt’s resignation, Mr. Dinneen wrote that there was a “collective sigh of relief coming from the Midwest,” calling the 2019 ethanol quotas “the straw that broke the camel’s back.”
While it is too early to say how the handling of waivers or the treatment of E15 may change under new leadership, one indicator was small losses in affected refiners in early Friday trading and gains in most ethanol producers. CVR Refining, Andeavor and Delek U.S. Holdings , all of which benefited from waivers granted by the EPA, had rallied by 136%, 40% and 92% in the year ended Thursday, respectively. Ethanol companies Pacific Ethanol and Green Plains had fallen by 60% and 14%, respectively. Agricultural lobbyists often portray any easing of the rules as a sop to “big oil,” but that isn’t accurate.
Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
Sixteen years ago, the Commons select committee for transport, local government and the regions reported on new towns in general, but this could could easily have been about Telford in particular:
"While many new towns have been economically successful, most are now experiencing major problems. Their design is inappropriate for the 21st century. Their infrastructure is aging at the same rate and many have social and economic problems...
"The new towns are no longer new and many of the quickly-built houses have reached the end of their design life. The master-plans dictated low density developments with large amounts of open space, and housing segregated from jobs, shopping and business services. These created car dependency and are now not considered sustainable.
But reports suggest that the mood among some of her MPs has soured. It's not just in pre-election Bavaria that anti-migrant rhetoric has borne fruit. When the leaders of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) crowed on Tuesday that they were "hunting the union, driving it before us" they were not entirely wrong in claiming triumph over the CDU and CSU. Mrs Merkel has failed to achieve her original dream - a Europe that would truly share the responsibility for sheltering asylum seekers.
Key California lawmakers said Thursday they've reached an agreement on legislation to enshrine net neutrality provisions in state law after the Federal Communications Commission dumped rules requiring an equal playing field on the internet. California's bill is one of the nation's most aggressive efforts to continue net neutrality, and the deal comes after a bitter fight among Democrats over how far the state should go. Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener, who repudiated his own legislation when major pieces were removed two weeks ago, said those provisions have been restored under his agreement with Democratic Assemblyman Miguel Santiago. "We need to ensure the internet is an open field where everyone has access, the companies that are providing internet access are not picking winners and losers," Wiener told reporters at a Capitol news conference. Santiago came under fire from net neutrality advocates around the country when the Assembly committee he leads stripped key provisions from the legislation — a decision that drew rebukes from members of Congress, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.
Abbott said on Tuesday night he never conceived of climate change as a moral challenge. “It was an issue, that’s all, and – at least on the actual changes we’ve so far seen – not a very significant one compared to man’s inhumanity to man; maintaining and improving living standards; and even to many other environmental issues such as degraded bush and waterways, particulate pollution, water quality in the third world, deforestation and urban overcrowding.”
He contended that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide from roughly 300 to 400 parts per million over the last century had not triggered “dramatic consequences”. Play Video 0:32 Andrew Probyn calls Tony Abbott 'destructive' in ABC report – video
“Storms are not more severe; droughts are not more prolonged; floods are not greater; and fires are not more intense than a century ago – despite hyperventilating reportage and over-the-top claims from Green politicians,” he said. “Sea levels have hardly risen and temperatures are still below those of the medieval warm period. Over time, temperature change seems to correlate rather more with sun spot activity than with carbon dioxide levels.
They include the United States withdrawing its 28,500 troops in South Korea, ending its military drills with South Korea and stop bringing in strategic assets such as aircraft carriers and nuclear-capable bombers. North Korea hasn't repeated such specific demands since entering disarmament talks earlier this year, raising optimism that the country truly appeared to seek to improve ties with the United States. After the summit, Trump suspended annual military training with South Korea that the North has called an invasion rehearsal. But North Korea still prefers a step-by-step disarmament process with reciprocal concessions and benefits from the United States for each of the North's denuclearization steps. The ultimate rewards North Korea wants range from the easing or lifting of American-led international sanctions, the signing of a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, the establishment of diplomatic ties and the pulling out of U.S. troops in South Korea, experts say.
He said the policies are "a bit Far West, of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." Le Drian said such policies have victims, "but the victims tomorrow will be the Americans themselves." ———

China's foreign ministry says retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods "took effect immediately" after Washington raised import duties on billions of dollars of Chinese goods. A foreign ministry spokesman, Hu Chunhua, on Friday gave no details of the increase. But Beijing previously issued a $34 billion list of American goods including soybeans and electric cars it said would be subject to 25 percent tariffs.
The University of Missouri is still facing enrollment and budgetary problems, including a $49 million budget shortfall, as a result of the 2015 social justice protests that caught national media attention. Many people remember the high-pitched yell of former University of Missouri professor Melissa Click. Click found herself at the center of weeks of unrest at the University of Missouri in 2015 and 2016. Click rose to infamy after a video of her calling for a student photojournalist to be physically removed from campus simply because he was documenting the protests. The protests involved accusations by students that the administration had mishandled several alleged racial issues on campus.
The proposal would:
Legalize the possession and sale of up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana for personal, recreational use for people over the age of 21. A person could keep up to 10 ounces of marijuana at home. Tax marijuana sales with a 10 percent excise tax at the retail level as well as the state's 6 percent sales tax. Split those revenues, with 35 percent going to K-12 education, 35 percent to roads, 15 percent to the communities that allow marijuana businesses in their communities and 15 percent to counties where marijuana business are located. Allow communities to decide whether they’ll allow marijuana businesses in their towns.
Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.

As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
These numbers are similar to those from a February Quinnipiac poll, where 49 percent of voters said Trump was racist and 46 percent said he was not. Forty-four percent of voters said they think “racist beliefs” were a motive in Trump’s immigration policy, while 50 percent said Trump has “a sincere interest in controlling our borders.” Sixty percent said the policy of separating children from their parents at the border was a violation of human rights. Since enacting the policy, Trump and his associates have repeatedly pushed false, racist narratives to garner support, often associating immigration with high crime rates despite no evidence to support claims that immigrants commit more crime than U.S. citizens. While only 11 percent of Republican voters in the Quinnipiac poll said they think Trump is a racist, 22 percent said they believe Trump has emboldened racist people to express their beliefs publicly. The number of hate crimes rose the year Trump was elected ― the first increase in over a decade.

The report says the combined value of metallurgical and thermal coal exports will be $60.2bn in 2017-18, behind iron ore at $61.8bn. It says coal exports will be slightly lower at $58.1bn in 2018-19, and that iron ore earnings will be even lower at $57.7bn, as falling iron ore prices drive export earnings lower. The Australian characterised that event as coal reclaiming its mantle as the nation’s “top export earner”. But the report says coal export earnings will soon drop below those for iron ore again, as global coal prices fall. India's huge solar ambitions could push coal further into shade Read more
In 2019-20 coal export earnings will be just $51.1bn, while iron ore earnings will be $55.4bn.
Mazzochi, an attorney, already has name recognition in DuPage County, he said, because of her experience on the College of DuPage Board. She was elected to that board in April 2015 and has been chairman or acting chairman since December 2015, which was a tumultuous time for the college. She will face Democrat James M. “Jim” Caffrey in the November election to represent the 47th district. Bellock said she was not looking for a full-time job after she retired from the Illinois House, but the governor and his team asked her to head the health care and family services department. “I look at this as a real honor,” Bellock said.
The U.S. economy continues to show strength in the wake of tax reform and deregulation, but the downside of robust growth is that Donald Trump thinks this means he can dabble at trade war with impunity. He ought to look at the signs that growth would be even stronger if not for his border-tax brawls. The latest evidence came in the minutes released Thursday from the Federal Open Market Committee’s June meeting. Fed district presidents from around the U.S. reported evidence of strong growth, but along the way came this warning:

“However, many District contacts expressed concern about the possible adverse effects of tariffs and other proposed trade restrictions, both domestically and abroad, on future investment activity; contacts in some Districts indicated that plans for capital spending had been scaled back or postponed as a result of uncertainty over trade policy.”
The minutes continued: “Contacts in the steel and aluminum industries expected higher prices as a result of the tariffs on these products but had not planned any new investments to increase capacity. Conditions in the agricultural sector reportedly improved somewhat, but contacts were concerned about the effect of potentially higher tariffs on their exports.”
These reports are from the economy’s ground floor, not the Beltway penthouse.
“Why are you supporting the animals of MS-13?” one tweet from @WhiteHouse directed at Harris reads, referencing a mostly Latino gang Trump has used to push his hard-line border policy. “Why are you supporting criminals moving weapons, drugs, and victims across our nation’s borders?” claims another aimed at Warren. “You must not know what ICE really does,” both missives end, using the acronym for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Neither Harris nor Warren has bought into the false claims about migrants made by the White House, and they have been vocal opponents of President Donald Trump’s zero tolerance immigration policy, which has led to thousands of children being separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border. Both women are seen as potential Democratic nominees for the 2020 presidential election.
Nonfarm payrolls surged by 223,000 jobs during that month as warm weather bolstered hiring at construction sites. June’s data is expected to show a 200,000 increase, according to a Reuters poll.

Liberated in March from immigration detention, where disease and threats were allegedly rife, he had been sent to a city ravaged by decades of civil war and terror. He told me his story but asked for his real name to be withheld as he feared being targeted by the Islamist al-Shabab group because of his work warning young people in the US about the dangers of recruitment by Somali militants.

Six months earlier, in a small town in Minnesota - which is home to the largest population of Somalis living in the US - it was dawn when Ahmed was driving his daughter to nursery. He noticed a large vehicle with tinted windows beginning to follow him. It seems officers from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) had been watching him closely and, after getting him to pull over, he was shackled and taken into custody.
Pentagon Questioned Over Blackout On War Zone Troop Numbers
Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images
For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.

Began his career in environmental law at the EPA, as a special assistant in the agency's toxics office during President George H.W. Spent years playing various roles on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, which oversees the EPA, drafting regulations on chemical safety, air and water pollution and climate change — generally seeking to reduce government regulations on industries that generate greenhouse gases. Served as longtime aide to Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., whom you may recall from the 2015 floor speech in which he rebutted climate change science with a snowball. After leaving Congress, worked for years as a lobbyist for some of the largest coal, chemical and uranium companies in the U.S. — including the uranium mining firm that pushed for the reduction of Bears Ears National Monument, which is near one of its processing facilities.
She was raped by a number of family members and was raped by the coyote who led her to the U.S.
Another one of Zittlau’s asylum clients was repeatedly raped and beaten by her husband in Guatemala. She went to the police for help, but they dismissed her claims and told her to apologize to her husband, Zittlau said. She continued to endure the abuse until she learned that her husband was molesting one of her children. She came to the U.S. last February with two of her daughters. Part of the struggle, Zittlau said, is conveying to her clients that assault shouldn’t be a part of everyday life.
"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.

It’s not strictly true to say everyone is against the three huge plant-forested glass spheres at what Amazon calls its “campus” in the heart of the city. The Bezos balls, as the conservatories are popularly known, are modelled on the greenhouses at London’s Kew Gardens, feature walkways above fig trees, ferns and rhododendrons, and provide hot-desking for Amazon workers looking for a break from the neighbouring office tower. There was nothing in that area 10 years ago,” said Jen Reed, selling jerky from another market stall. “I don’t hate Amazon the way that a lot of people hate them.
The services sector, where most Americans are employed, has now expanded for 101 consecutive months, or more than eight years. The gain was better than many economists had been expecting and depicts an overall economy that appears to be regaining momentum after a slowdown in the winter.
“That was a very sad day for the country when that vote was cast,” Trump said in June. But Republican lawmakers dispute arguments suggesting their efforts to undo ObamaCare have been totally fruitless. “We eliminated the individual mandate that said that people had to buy government-approved insurance,” said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo. “In a sense, it blew a big hole in ObamaCare.”
There’s a potential electoral landmine ahead for Republicans hoping to keep their majorities in the House and Senate, though: premium increases. “We’re going to get another round right before the election, which is something the GOP is nervous about,” said John C.

That suggests that the world will have to wait for Trump to look at the incoming economic data and realise that trade wars are not as easy to win as he thinks. It could, though, be some time before the penny drops. Exports are booming and on some estimates will add a full percentage point to growth in the second quarter of 2018, a period when the US was expanding at an annual rate of around 4%. That will allow Trump to argue that his tough approach to trade is paying off. There are reasons why the US economy is currently strong, but none of them have anything to do with tariffs on imports.
Just hours after his historic election victory sent thousands of supporters pouring on to the streets, the 64-year-old leftist tweeted that he had received a call from Donald Trump. “I proposed that we explore an integral agreement of development projects, which generate jobs in Mexico and with that reduce migration and improve security. There was respectful treatment and our representatives will speak more.”
In an interview with the Televisa news network, López Obrador emphasized the need for mutual respect and cooperation between the two neighbors. “We are conscious of the need to maintain good relations with the United States.

The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.
Truly, ours is a land of tremendous opportunity. For our children, the possibilities are limitless so long as we do not squander their American inheritance.

The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. Teachers are also running a ballot measure campaign that would tax the highest income earners for an additional $690 million to spend on schools. “Regardless of political parties, we need people to make a decision about what’s happening in the classroom,” said Marisol Garcia, vice president of the Arizona Education Association. “To limit ourselves and to say ‘only these people are going to support us’ is just not true.”
Teachers can be at a disadvantage compared to wealthier candidates, who tend to have built-in networks of potential donors.

“They’ve twisted American values,” she said in a follow-up phone interview. “A lot of them are anti-God, anti-religion and anti-military.”
In the survey, most say they are proud to be Americans, although Republicans feel that way more strongly (90 percent) than Democrats (61 percent). There is no consensus when asked about the country’s current course, though: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. “Overwhelming majorities of those in both parties and independents agree that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.”” USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll

Eric Young, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees’ Council of Prison Locals, now prays before he looks at his phone every morning, worried he’ll receive a message from BOP’s director notifying him of a staff death. Young estimates that around two-thirds of his union members were Trump supporters. That makes sense: It’s a law enforcement agency that leans white and male (72 percent male, 62 percent white), and many federal prisons are in rural parts of the country, which Trump dominated. But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau. BOP has long suffered the kind of problems you’d expect for a massive bureaucracy centered on caging tens of thousands of people.

After leaving Congress, worked for years as a lobbyist for some of the largest coal, chemical and uranium companies in the U.S. — including the uranium mining firm that pushed for the reduction of Bears Ears National Monument, which is near one of its processing facilities.

The city council has struggled to find a path that remains true to Seattle’s progressive values while keeping the source of much of its recent prosperity happy. In 2015 it became the first major US city to increase its minimum wage to $15 an hour.

"Peace and tranquility are the fruits of justice," Lopez Obrador said. Exit polling by Consulta Mitofsky for the Televisa network forecast gubernatorial wins for allies of Lopez Obrador's Morena party in at least four of eight state races on the ballot plus for the head of government in Mexico City. The central state of Guanajuato was expected to go to a candidate of the conservative National Action Party. Mitofsky predicted Morena allies would take between 56 and 70 seats in the 128-member Senate and between 256 and 291 spots in the 500-seat lower house. "The anger that the average Mexican feels toward the way things are being governed has favored Lopez Obrador," said Shannon O'Neil, senior fellow for Latin America Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.
NANTERRE, France -- French investigators believe a team of four or five loyal accomplices carried out the brazen prison helicopter escape of one of France's most notorious criminals. The armed, masked men took a helicopter pilot hostage, forced him to land Sunday in Reau Prison's yard, used power tools to break through the prison yard's doors and hustled Redoine Faid to freedom. Inmates could be heard cheering on cell phone video taken inside the prison during the bust. Faid's brother, Brahim, was visiting him at the time of the escape. He was detained immediately afterward and freed late Monday.
Tesla could use a lighter moment. It has had a 2018 filled with ups and downs. In May, Consumer Reports initially did not recommend the electric vehicle giant’s Model 3, its first car priced for mainstream buyers, in part because of long stopping distances, only to see the magazine relent after it flashed software to cars that improved them. Last month, Tesla topped a list of best-selling electric vehicles in the United States, selling three of the five most popular cars. And this week, Tesla announced that it had reached Musk's goal of manufacturing 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week.
The Republican Party is rotting away. The problem is that GOP policies just aren’t popular. Most Americans unsurprisingly oppose climate denial, tax cuts for the wealthy, and putting children (including toddlers) in concentration camps, for example. The Republican Party has thus far managed to continue winning elections by creating “a coalition between racists and plutocrats,” as Paul Krugman put it. The party’s economic policies are aimed at benefitting wealthy individuals and corporations, but that’s a slim segment of the American electorate.

Trump’s campaign to limit legal and illegal immigration is driving up wages and salaries for Americans in various locations and careers around the country. The beneficiaries include new employees, African-American bakers in Chicago, Latino restaurant workers in Monterey, Calif., disabled people nationwide, high schoolers, resort workers in Hilton Head, construction workers, Superbowl workers, the garment industry, and workers at small businesses, and even Warren Buffett’s railroad workers. Amnesty advocates rely on business-funded “Nation of Immigrants” push-polls to show apparent voter support for immigration and immigrants. But “choice” polls reveal most voters’ often-ignored preference that CEOs should hire Americans at decent wages before hiring migrants.

U.S. Government lawyers are slamming one of President Donald Trump's most prominent critics, attorney Michael Avenatti, over nearly half a million dollars in unpaid federal taxes owed by his former firm. Avenatti's former law firm, Eagan Avenatti LLP, agreed to make the roughly $452,000 tax payment last month in order to resolve a bankruptcy case, but the funds never arrived at the IRS, according to a filing Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, Calif.

A new USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll about patriotism, pegged to this week's celebration of the Fourth of July, finds an overwhelming majority of those surveyed — 90 percent — say they are proud to be Americans. But they split almost down the middle, 42 percent to 39 percent, when asked whether they are proud of America right now. Not surprisingly, the split was along partisan lines: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. There was bipartisan agreement on one thing: Across party lines, roughly seven in 10 agree with the statement, "I feel fatigued watching the news." Elsewhere in politics

If Obrador and his party, Morena, perform as expected, some conservatives worry he will have a majority and a Congressional mandate to enact sweeping reforms, including free access to the Internet, a doubling of pensions for the elderly, educational grants for students, an increase in the minimum wage and subsidies for small farmers and single mothers. “The only candidate who was truly successful positioning himself as an agent of change was AMLO,” said former PAN party foreign minister Jorge Castaneda, who believes Obrador won the election based on three issues: violence, corruption and the economy. “In the last twenty-odd years, this includes the government I served in, the economy has not grown more than two and a half percent per year,” Castaneda said. “Mexicans are not finding deep well-paying jobs, not seeing their living standards improved, not extracting people from poverty, we’re not reducing levels of inequality which are among the highest levels in the world.”
Almost 44 percent of Mexicans live below the national poverty line, earning less than $5 per day, according to the World Bank. Poverty is most extreme in the rural south, where unemployment and violence remain highest.

Average attendance for the Fourth of July is 20,000 to 25,000 people, he added. The park service also was taking a closer look at the statue to see if there was any damage, though that's unlikely, Willis said. The copper-pounded skin is only the thickness of two pennies but "it's strong," he said. "That statue has been out in the middle of New York Harbor for 130 years — with hurricanes and lightning and everything that nature has thrown at her," he said.
He was, in other words, beginning to sound more like his tweets, and perhaps just a bit like Donald Trump. Brennan’s father, Owen, was a blacksmith who immigrated to New Jersey from Ireland in 1948. Owen’s own father, Brennan told me, was “a supporter, an affiliate, say,” of the Irish Republican Army. Brennan moved twice while growing up, from one apartment to another before settling in a three-family house in North Bergen. His grandmother lived on the top floor.

Eric Young, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees’ Council of Prison Locals, now prays before he looks at his phone every morning, worried he’ll receive a message from BOP’s director notifying him of a staff death. Young estimates that around two-thirds of his union members were Trump supporters. That makes sense: It’s a law enforcement agency that leans white and male (72 percent male, 62 percent white), and many federal prisons are in rural parts of the country, which Trump dominated. But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau. BOP has long suffered the kind of problems you’d expect for a massive bureaucracy centered on caging tens of thousands of people.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
The AntiFa group organized some distance away but not before police seized weapons such as utility knives, clubs and chemical sprays, according to The Oregonian. Despite the confiscations, the AntiFa group initiated hostilities by throwing eggs, bottles, and other items at the Patriot group, the paper noted. Officers reported witnessing incidents of assault and soon revoked the Patriot group’s permit and began forcing both groups to leave the area. Antifa activists left graffiti in their wake according to Twitter users:

But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits.

Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
And then you have the old guard, like Pelosi and others at the top. And there is no overall messaging that is bringing that all together. That's why these arguments like abolish ICE start catching fire, because there's no other counter message out there from the Democrats--

Ethiopia's government has fired five prison officials as it confronts allegations of torture and other abuses of inmates as part of a wave of reforms. Among those fired is the federal prison chief who until recently defended the treatment of inmates as "fair." The firings came ahead of a new Human Rights Watch report released Thursday that documents widespread arbitrary detention, torture, rape and humiliation over several years in Ethiopia's eastern Somali region. It urges new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to investigate the "horrific" situation. Abiy has admitted that security forces have tortured people but has yet to "tackle Ethiopia's culture of impunity and ensure accountability," said Felix Horne, senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch.

Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, one of the most powerful conservatives in Congress, has denied reports that he ignored the alleged sexual abuse of athletes while he worked as an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University more than 20 years ago. Allegations that Jordan was aware of sexual misconduct and explicitly was informed of specific incidents of alleged assault by the wrestling team's doctor, first surfaced in an NBC news story on Tuesday. But Jordan — who was an assistant coach from 1987 until 1995, when he was elected to the state legislature — has refuted the claims. "Congressman Jordan never saw any abuse, never heard about any abuse, and never had any abuse reported to him during his time as a coach at Ohio State," Ian Fury, Jordan's spokesman, said in a statement. "He has not been contacted by investigators about the matter but will assist them in any way they ask, because if what is alleged is true, the victims deserve a full investigation and justice."Rep.

Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.
“What remains to be seen is whether the enthusiasm holds up in November.”

Practice is only one of Deborah Glass’s 125 recommendations not accepted by Victorian government
Female prisoners in Victoria are still subject to “abusive” routine strip searches, a state government watchdog says. The Victorian ombudsman, Deborah Glass, said the government has failed to adopt a recommendation from her 2015 report into the prison system that called for an end to the searches. “Why has the government not accepted my recommendation to stop the abusive practice of routinely strip-searching women prisoners – in fact, the only recommendation out of 125 not accepted?” she asked on Wednesday. The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year.
In what ways should these concerns shape congressional expectations about transparency of the nominee vetting process and the standards for recusal in cases involving President Trump’s legal affairs? Consider first the not-unlikely prospect of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who has developed a robust view of presidential immunity from legal process fully consistent with some of the more aggressive positions of the president and his legal team. Kavanaugh has written that:
Congress might consider a law exempting a President—while in office—from criminal prosecution and investigation, including from questioning by criminal prosecutors or defense counsel. Criminal investigations targeted at or revolving around a President are inevitably politicized by both their supporters and critics. As I have written before, “no Attorney General or special counsel will have the necessary credibility to avoid the inevitable charges that he is politically motivated—whether in favor of the President or against him, depending on the individual leading the investigation and its results.” The indictment and trial of a sitting President, moreover, would cripple the federal government, rendering it unable to function with credibility in either the international or domestic arenas.

Some immigrant U.S. Army reservists and recruits who enlisted in the military with a promised path to citizenship are being abruptly discharged, the Associated Press has learned. The AP was unable to quantify how many men and women who enlisted through the special recruitment program have been booted from the Army, but immigration attorneys say they know of more than 40 who have been discharged or whose status has become questionable, jeopardizing their futures. "It was my dream to serve in the military," said reservist Lucas Calixto, a Brazilian immigrant who filed a lawsuit against the Army last week. "Since this country has been so good to me, I thought it was the least I could do to give back to my adopted country and serve in the United States military." Some of the service members say they were not told why they were being discharged.

The federal government provides about 80 percent of the state's Medicaid funds. The cuts to dental and vision benefits were supposed to affect only able-bodied adults, mostly those added to Medicaid under an expansion authorized through the Affordable Care Act. Advocates say the cutoff of vision and dental benefits is unnecessary and possibly illegal. Bevin's administration announced the cuts after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Friday rejected Bevin's sweeping plan to overhaul the state's Medicaid program. The plan would have eliminated dental and vision benefits for such individuals, although they could earn points toward purchasing such services with a "My Rewards" account through activities such as volunteering or taking online classes.
President Trump’s reshaping of the GOP from being aligned to the Chamber of Commerce to a party serving the interests of America’s working and middle class is winning over young white American men en masse. Ahead of Trump’s election to the presidency in 2016, nearly 50 percent of young white men favored Democrats, and 36 percent favored the GOP. That 14-point gain has flipped, and young white men now favor the GOP over the Democrats by 46 percent to 37 percent. At the time, the GOP was aligned with the big business lobby and Wall Street in promoting endless multinational free trade that readily outsourced American jobs to foreign countries. The Republican establishment, in 2016, was pushing the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which would have eliminated millions of working and middle-class jobs while also driving down wages for remaining American workers.

The automaker claims it "effectively resolves" the problem. NHTSA has received almost 200 complaints about the issue.
Ethiopia's government has fired five prison officials as it confronts allegations of torture and other abuses of inmates as part of a wave of reforms. Among those fired is the federal prison chief who until recently defended the treatment of inmates as "fair." The firings came ahead of a new Human Rights Watch report released Thursday that documents widespread arbitrary detention, torture, rape and humiliation over several years in Ethiopia's eastern Somali region. It urges new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to investigate the "horrific" situation. Abiy has admitted that security forces have tortured people but has yet to "tackle Ethiopia's culture of impunity and ensure accountability," said Felix Horne, senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.

Freshman Rep. Moira Jayne Walsh, 27, who has been outspoken about what she sees as a culture of corruption in the State House, lost her party's endorsement to Michael Earnheart, who voted for President Donald Trump. As a safe blue state, Rhode Island rarely gets any national political attention. But Walsh woke up Tuesday to donations from as far away as Texas and California. Party officials describe Earnheart as a "lifelong Democrat" who voted for Trump because he didn’t like Hillary Clinton.

The NHS will consume 66% of the Welsh budget by 2048 if demand increases in line with predicted demand, according to new research. Health economist Prof Ceri Phillips said spending on the NHS would need to rise by 4% a year. Currently £6bn out of a total Welsh budget of £14.5bn goes to the NHS. The Welsh Government said its Health and Social Care Plan aimed to reduce demand through more people managing their own health and well-being. BBC Wales Investigates had asked Prof Phillips, from Swansea University, to question existing projections for healthcare in Wales and then calculate how much extra spending would be needed to keep the NHS afloat.
THESSALONIKI, Greece (Reuters) - Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia and Romania will work closer on energy and transport projects to better connect their economies, their leaders said on Wednesday after a summit in Thessaloniki.

“Railway, highway and port interconnectivity offers our region an important geopolitical perspective,” Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said at the meeting in northern Greece. “We can build the foundations for the European Balkans.”

Tsipras, who reached a deal with Skopje last month to end a decades-old dispute over use of the name Macedonia, said there was increasingly “common thinking” among the four leaders on seeing their countries grow together.
Part of its mission is to provide local veterans with a monthly ration of what he calls medical-grade cannabis free of charge. It started back in 2011. Newsom and his co-founder began growing and sharing pot as an alternative to the drugs the VA had them on. It has since grown to serve about 1,000 veterans. The office where he's sorting the cannabis sits above one of their grow operations.
Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.
Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) trashed the June jobs report — even though it showed rapid job growth, rising wages, and low unemployment. The report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that employers created 213,000 new jobs in June — 22,000 more than economists had expected. Manufacturing jobs in particular rose by 36,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.
Teddy Roosevelt hopped on whistle stop tour after whistle stop tour where he was able to drop into rural and suburban communities alike to deliver short, pre-packaged speeches that local papers would usually print verbatim. (He left them short on purpose for that very reason.) Franklin Roosevelt revolutionized and heightened the stature of the office with his fireside chats, that brought his message over the heads of the pesky press corps and directly into the living rooms of the American people. But, though it would have been seen as a scoop, even the reporters covering Lyndon B. Johnson had the good sense not to report on every turd he dropped in their presence. While the founders envisioned a government that moved slowly and methodically, today’s Wi-Fi-enabled political discourse is demanding the opposite.

President Donald Trump spoke to Sen. Mike Lee on Monday about the Supreme Court seat that will soon be vacated by retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy, spokespeople for Lee and the president said Tuesday. Deputy White House press secretary Raj Shah said in a statement that the president spoke on the phone with Lee. Story Continued Below
Earlier Tuesday, the Utah-based Deseret News reported that Lee (R-Utah) had been interviewed by Trump a day earlier. Conn Carroll, Lee’s communications director, shared a Deseret News Twitter post with that reporting and added, “Can confirm.”
Trump, who met with a handful of other potential Supreme Court picks earlier this week, has said he intends to announce his nominee on Monday.
Delivering a speech in Newcastle on Thursday, he said: “At the moment, protectionism is largely just talk (and tweets). But what if rhetoric becomes reality?”
Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.
Mrs May said she would not comment on a leaked report that the government had not yet seen. She said the government would consider it when it received it. (you can read the BBC story on it here)
She then said all donations to the Scottish Conservatives were accepted and declared in accordance with the law after Mr Blackford accused the party of "systematically shielding donations from public scrutiny". Referring to reports on the Ferret website, he alleged the Scottish Conservatives had received £319,000 from the Scottish Unionist Association Trust and said there was no information about who manages the trust, who its donors are or its assets. He urged the prime minister to reveal what checks had taken place before the money was accepted and for an investigation.
For them, expedited approval can mean not only sped-up sales but also — if the drug is intended to treat a rare disease or serve a neglected population — FDA incentives worth hundreds of millions of dollars. “Instead of a regulator and a regulated industry, we now have a partnership,” said Dr. Michael Carome, director of the health research group for the nonprofit advocacy organization Public Citizen, and a former U.S. Department of Health and Human Services official. “That relationship has tilted the agency away from a public health perspective to an industry friendly perspective.”

While the FDA over the past three decades has implemented at least four major routes to faster approvals — the current commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, is easing even more drugs’ path to market. The FDA okayed 46 “novel” drugs — whose chemical structure hadn’t been previously approved — in 2017, the most in at least 15 years. At the same time, it’s rejecting fewer medications.
In a statement, Cleveland police said it is "not our policy to discuss tactics or personnel resources" regarding whether they would be increasing security Wednesday.

3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.

President Donald Trump is not responsible for the killing of journalists in Annapolis last week. His belittling of the press — his “enemy of the American people” taunts, his promises to roll back libel laws, his fomenting rage toward specific journalists at rallies — is worth mentioning within the context of the murders, because it speaks to a larger concern that last Thursday’s attack on The Capital Gazette won’t be an isolated incident. Journalists, many of whom already risk their lives covering war and violence, many of whom receive death threats regularly, feel understandable jitters about a leader who tries to turn the American public against us, particularly when we watch a member of that public shoot up a newsroom and end five lives. It’s reckless and inaccurate, though, to pin the shootings on Trump. The suspect swore an oath to kill a Capital writer who wrote about him in 2011.
“They’ve twisted American values,” she said in a follow-up phone interview. “A lot of them are anti-God, anti-religion and anti-military.”
In the survey, most say they are proud to be Americans, although Republicans feel that way more strongly (90 percent) than Democrats (61 percent). There is no consensus when asked about the country’s current course, though: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. “Overwhelming majorities of those in both parties and independents agree that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.”” USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll

Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.

In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners. Alas, he is wasting his time trying to shift the views of the Democratic Party, which has become ever more left-wing, if not outright socialist. I think it is time for Mr. James to become a Republican. Guy Randolph

It’s shocking that Mr. James is surprised by the positive economic results of less regulation and lower taxes.
"The president of the republic and his government will be absolutely respectful and support the authorities that are elected," Pena Nieto told reporters. Hovering over the election is the specter of vote fraud, though electoral officials deny it is a possibility with the modern balloting technology and institutions now in place. In both of Lopez Obrador's previous two presidential losses he alleged fraud. In his first loss — by a mere 0.56 percent to conservative Felipe Calderon in 2006 — his supporters held months-long protests in Mexico City and he referred to himself as "the legitimate president." His allies are warning even before Sunday's presidential vote that there better not be any funny business.
Pentagon Questioned Over Blackout On War Zone Troop Numbers
Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images
For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.
"I told them how I was feeling, but they didn’t listen to me." There were no beds, so Rosa laid on the floor. She said she wondered whether she might die there on the cold, hard, floor of that Arizona detention center. "Thanks to God," she said, "I am better."
The liberal high school teacher ousted a 24-year incumbent who served as House majority leader in 2016. Now, the state party has endorsed a professor at a Catholic University who signed a letter supporting Ireland's abortion ban, which was recently overturned. "Quite frankly, they are not used to women of color, black women, standing up," Ranglin-Vassell said. Democratic state Rep. Teresa Tanzi, standing, talks with Democratic Rep.

"It's not a unique business," Troia said. "In this case, they just got caught with the door open." Two days after news of that leak broke, a data breach at the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training at Texas State University exposed the personal information of thousands of law enforcement officers. In that case, which was first reported by ZDNet, the personal info was stored on an unsecured web server, a university spokesman told CNNMoney. Data breaches can happen to anyone, of course -- just ask Equifax (EFX), which experienced a hack that exposed the personal information of over 147 million people last fall.
The first, Antonio Halili, was the mayor of the much larger Tanauan City, south of Manila. Unlike Bote, Halili had developed both a reputation for having a heavy hand against drug traffickers and negotiating with them. Halili appeared on a more recent Duterte list of elected officials with ties to drug trafficking in 2017. Shortly after Halili’s assassination, Duterte told reporters, “I don’t know who killed him, but I told you don’t [engage in illegal drugs]. … His procession of drug suspects was just a front.”
Prior to this accusation, however, Halili had established a “walk of shame” program where he paraded drug suspects around his city for the public to jeer, leading others in the government to suggest he was killed by drug traffickers in revenge for humiliating their peers.
The president told Fox News that he believes his nominee will get some support from Democrats. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, an abortion rights supporter, is considered one of the key votes on a nominee. She said she wouldn't vote for someone who would overturn Roe v. Wade. "A candidate who would overturn Roe would not be acceptable," she said Sunday on ABC's This Week. Collins, who has previously bucked party lines on other key issues such as health care, said she plans to have an in-depth conversation with the nominee.
The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.

We look at other parts of the world, where women are not allowed to vote, or dance, and we see ourselves as modern and liberated. But all our “freedoms” are fairly recent, from being able to get a mortgage to being protected from rape in marriage. The narrative of progress is one that too many liberals imbibe, but it is untrue. In many of the areas to which we turn when we measure gender equality, we have not moved forward for the past 10 years – income, political engagement, education.
But he said Pitts's extensive conversations with the undercover FBI employee, combined with a criminal record that included charges for assault, domestic violence and carrying a concealed weapon, gave agents cause for concern. He said the FBI arrested Pitts after he met with the undercover employee for a final time Sunday. "We don't have the luxury of hoping that an individual decides not to harm someone or get others to act, especially when his continued repeated intentions were to do just that," Anthony said. The FBI had been tipped to Pitts as far back as 2015, when he sent a private Facebook message to "The Craig Sewing Show," a California-based political commentary show, saying, "The USA will be destroy.
As well as a new president, Mexican will be voting for 128 senators and 500 deputies in Congress as well as state and local officials. In all, 88 million people will be eligible to vote. Mexico is the second largest economy in Latin America and a major oil exporter. However, oil prices have dropped and the Mexican currency, the peso, has fallen sharply against the dollar. More than 40% of the population lives in poverty and high levels of corruption and violence have led some companies to pull out of the worst affected areas.
Khalaf spent time in a camp for displaced people in northern Iraq before eventually relocating to Germany, where she lives now. Ahmed Khudida Burjus, the deputy director of Yazda, a U.S.-based Yazidi rights group, says around 7,000 women and girls were captured and sold into slavery, with nearly half eventually escaping. In Kocho alone, at least 500 men and boys were killed, and 800 women and girls taken away. The group has documented at least 54 mass graves of Yazidis, but says a lack of resources has delayed the exhumation of the remains, and that there may be more graves yet to be discovered. Over the past three years, Syrian and Iraqi forces have gradually driven IS out of nearly all the territory it once held.
LONDON (Reuters) - The United States and Saudi Arabia appear to have reached an understanding: Washington will reduce or eliminate Iran’s oil export revenues and in return Riyadh will guarantee oil supplies and stabilize prices.

The basic deal is well understood by policymakers in both countries, with U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly emphasizing his great personal relationship with the Saudi king and crown prince. But strong personal relationships between the leaders and agreement on the overall deal obscure disagreement on some key details, not least the desirable level for oil prices.
Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop.

It's difficult to imagine Old Hickory, as he was known, excusing himself from military duty on the grounds that he could not march long distances, as Mr Trump did during the Vietnam War, citing bone spurs. The parallels between the 45th president and the 13th - unlucky for some - are arguably more compelling. Fillmore launched his career in the 1820s with the Anti-Masonic Party, hawking a paranoid rumour that ruling Freemasons were murdering whistleblowers. Mr Trump paved the way for his White House bid by peddling a conspiracy theory, too - that President Barack Obama was not a US citizen.

Fillmore later joined the Whig Party at a time of mounting hostility to refugees from famine, rebellion and tyranny who were arriving by the shipload at the gates of the New World.
Harley-Davidson responded by saying it would shift production of motorbikes for the EU market out of the US. A different president might have seen this as a warning of the collateral damage likely to be caused to the US economy from a trade war, but not this one. In phase two, Trump says he will target $200bn of Chinese goods and is threatening to put a 20% duty on automotive imports from Europe. Both will inevitably provoke tit-for-tat retaliation. The White House has already signalled what phase three of the programme will involve: new investment restrictions on Chinese firms in an attempt to stop intellectual property theft; and the US leaving the World Trade Organisation on the grounds that the Geneva-based body was designed by the rest of the world to screw America.

The government of the northern state of Chihuahua reported that three people were arrested in the border city of Ciudad Juarez for allegedly trying to buy votes for an unnamed political party. And in Michoacan state, polling places in a few villages were cancelled after some inhabitants said they didn't want elections involving political parties, which they mistrust. Some ballots were stolen and burned in the town of Nahuatzen to prevent voting.

The cuts to dental and vision benefits were supposed to affect only able-bodied adults, mostly those added to Medicaid under an expansion authorized through the Affordable Care Act.

"Cohen added: 'Once I understand what charges might be filed against me, if any at all, I will defer to my new counsel, Guy Petrillo, for guidance.' Story Continued Below
"But when I pointed out to Cohen that he wasn’t repeating past vows to 'take a bullet' and 'do anything' to protect the president, the longtime Trump loyalist left little doubt about where he stands now, saying simply: 'To be crystal clear, my wife, my daughter and my son, and this country have my first loyalty.'
Research has consistently shown that Trump won because of racial resentment among white voters. Chris Hayes (@chrislhayes) The modern GOP is basically Steve Bannon, Steve King and Stephen Miller on one side engaged in a project to preserve and enshrine dominance for its ethnic/racial base, and Paul Ryan and John Roberts on the other who pretend they have no idea what they’re up to. While that strategy has worked in the short-term, some Republicans recognize that it can’t work in the long-term, and they’re fighting to save their party from extinction.

Kidnappings, armed robberies, and violent attacks are now commonplace. Venezuela is widely considered one of the most dangerous destinations in the world. As noted by El Nacional, “There are many travelers who have been stripped of money, luggage, and vehicles on the Caracas-La Guaira highway, especially at night and early morning when the road is little traveled and lacks surveillance.”
The doctors were present in Venezuela as part of an agreement between the two countries. Venezuela typically pays for the doctors in vast quantities of oil, an initiative that started under Hugo Chávez and Fidel Castro.
On this much police and activist South Side priest Michael Pfleger can agree: Saturday morning’s anti-violence march on the Dan Ryan Expressway is all about danger. Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.
Nebraska May Join Utah, Idaho in Putting Medicaid Expansion Before Voters
Enlarge this image toggle caption Fred Knapp/NET News Fred Knapp/NET News
Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.

Hall apologised, saying it was a “silly thing to say and not a reflection of who I am ... I have nothing but respect for women”. Gee, we’ve heard that before. Nothing but respect for women. Leyonhjelm won’t even say sorry, can’t even see that saying “men should stop raping women” is not comparable to “all men are rapists”.
That will allow Trump to argue that his tough approach to trade is paying off. There are reasons why the US economy is currently strong, but none of them have anything to do with tariffs on imports. In part, it is the lagged effect of a buoyant global economy in 2017; in part it is explained by tax cuts and the stimulus still being provided by only gently rising interest rates. Mickey Levy, chief US economist for Berenberg, says Trump’s deregulation agenda has been a factor in boosting America’s underlying growth rate. Evidence from Barack Obama’s presidency shows how protectionist policies can backfire.

Daniel Egan tells inquiry that it was obvious everybody needed to get out, not stay put
The inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire has heard that a senior firefighter who arrived at the blaze just before 2am thought the residents should have been evacuated long before they were. During testimonies that made clear a lack of communication between firefighters, the inquiry heard how Daniel Egan, a senior fire safety officer with the London fire brigade arrived at the fire at 1.58am and immediately thought “we need to get people out of the building.”
“It looked like a film, people were shouting and screaming, they were panicking and wanting people to help,” he said. “My first thoughts were that we needed to get everybody out. I could hear the roar of the tower. It was obvious … you could hear people screaming … it was just so obvious, sorry.”
The “stay put” policy wasn’t abandoned until 2.47am, after which residents calling 999 who had been told to stay in their flats were told to try and evacuate.
The economy has added an average 207,000 jobs a month this year after a blowout number of 223,000 in May. Economists predict that 195,000 jobs were added in June. Unemployment stands at 3.8%, the lowest rate since 2000. If it dips to 3.7%, it will be the lowest since 1969.

An IPO market that was left for dead just two years ago has come roaring back in 2018, with companies raising public capital at a pace rarely seen in the past two decades. So far this year, 120 companies have used initial public offerings to raise $35.2 billion on U.S. exchanges. That is the highest volume since 2012 and the fourth-busiest year-to-date on record, according to Dealogic, whose data go back to 1995.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
The term might provide only “a very, very modest preview” of waves of conservative rulings to come, however, because a locked-down conservative majority would likely inspire rightwing activists to bring increasingly aggressive cases, said Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. “It’s not just that justice Kennedy’s successor is likely going to move the court to the right,” Vladeck said. “It’s that knowing that there are five conservative justices surely emboldens states and conservative interest groups to bring to the supreme court legal theories that they might have been reluctant to leave in justice Kennedy’s hands.”

If that picture of the country’s jurisprudential future has left liberals distraught, it has also raised questions about the court’s increasingly politicized nature, its power to shape society and the erosion of its independence as one branch of government meant to balance the other two – Congress and the presidency – and to be checked in turn itself. While past courts have had liberal or conservative bents, since the Bush v Gore decision that decided the 2000 election, the court has taken on a more explicitly political feel. “People say the founders would roll over in their graves – I think the founders would hang themselves”, said Mickey Edwards, vice-president of the Aspen Institute think-tank and formerly a congressman for 16 years.

Its Clair Ridge development is expected to come on-stream later this year.

It looks much less attractive to global players.
Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.
Hamilton, the Republican state lawmaker who beat the incumbent Karnes, won with a mix of support from teachers and other unions. While Karnes sparred with teachers during the strike, Hamilton took a moderate position. He aligned with teachers unions by opposing state right-to-work legislation and the proposed repeal of prevailing wage laws for public construction projects. The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.

Under the laws, up to 40% of Supreme Court judges could be forced out. The first president of the court, Malgorzata Gersdorf, could be among those pushed out before her six-year term ends, by a rule that brings down the retirement age from 70 to 65, the EU warns. Why are the reforms so controversial?

The EU launched a legal case last December, arguing that the independence of the Supreme Court and Constitutional Court have been undermined by the package of reforms.
Despite decades of UN and government aid, 38% of the population lived in extreme poverty. Social workers proposed new a new approach. Puente al Desarrollo – A Bridge to Development – is human rights-based legislation that has seen government agencies and communities coming together to address social problems – and support people in meeting their aspirations. The new law applies a social work approach of responding to all the issues that contribute to poverty and strengthening community systems of self-care. Cristian Rodríguez Barrantes, a social worker on a drug-smuggling route in the Costa Rican slums, describes how the law works in practice.
Abbott said on Tuesday night he never conceived of climate change as a moral challenge. “It was an issue, that’s all, and – at least on the actual changes we’ve so far seen – not a very significant one compared to man’s inhumanity to man; maintaining and improving living standards; and even to many other environmental issues such as degraded bush and waterways, particulate pollution, water quality in the third world, deforestation and urban overcrowding.”
He contended that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide from roughly 300 to 400 parts per million over the last century had not triggered “dramatic consequences”. Play Video 0:32 Andrew Probyn calls Tony Abbott 'destructive' in ABC report – video
“Storms are not more severe; droughts are not more prolonged; floods are not greater; and fires are not more intense than a century ago – despite hyperventilating reportage and over-the-top claims from Green politicians,” he said. “Sea levels have hardly risen and temperatures are still below those of the medieval warm period. Over time, temperature change seems to correlate rather more with sun spot activity than with carbon dioxide levels.
The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.
Bevin's administration announced the cuts after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Friday rejected Bevin's sweeping plan to overhaul the state's Medicaid program. The plan would have eliminated dental and vision benefits for such individuals, although they could earn points toward purchasing such services with a "My Rewards" account through activities such as volunteering or taking online classes. In a statement released Sunday, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services described the cuts "as an unfortunate consequence of the judge's ruling." "It's coming across as hostage-taking" said Dustin Pugel, a policy analyst with the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy in Berea.
He said he supports the project and wants to see it succeed “more than anybody.”
Moore said he knows Obama dating back to the former president’s days as an Illinois state senator running for Congress, driving with him to community meetings and even going as a surrogate for him once or twice.
He aligned himself with most of his Democratic colleagues against Gina Haspel, Trump's pick for CIA director, arguing that her record on enhanced interrogation techniques was unacceptable. And instead of focusing on a politically safe issue in his maiden Senate floor speech, Jones struck a nerve by calling for a dialogue on gun violence after the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida. In addition, during the campaign, Jones made no secret of his desire to protect LGBTQ rights and to support a woman's right to abortion. It's those kinds of positions that have made him a darling of Alabama's progressive minority — and somewhat of a public enemy among the state's conservative majority. Jones has introduced four pieces of legislation — none of any huge significance — since he arrived on Capitol Hill, including two agriculture bills, one that would expand access to capital for rural job creators and the last seeking to mandate an annual Medicaid expansion review.
President Trump has just said in the past week he's going to raise things like Syria, like Ukraine, like the election meddling issue, really the whole range of issues between us. And I think that, in the president's mind, this is very important, because it gives him an opportunity to size up Vladimir Putin, to see where there are areas where we might make progress together and where there are areas where we may not. BRENNAN: Well, right now, Russia is blanket-bombing Southern Syria. That violates the last agreement Vladimir Putin made with President Trump. Why would he believe that he's in any way trustworthy?
Having started out with a higher than average unemployment rate, Telford has since witnessed the arrival of major American, European and Japanese businesses: notably Hitachi, Denso, Maxell and Ricoh. Together they brought in thousands of high-technology jobs while the neighbouring Birmingham and Black Country conurbation was still rooted predominantly in traditional metal-based industries. Equally, there is no disguising the scale of the challenges the town has faced along the way. Sixteen years ago, the Commons select committee for transport, local government and the regions reported on new towns in general, but this could could easily have been about Telford in particular:
"While many new towns have been economically successful, most are now experiencing major problems. Their design is inappropriate for the 21st century.

Last week, in a sweeping cabinet reshuffle, Nicola Sturgeon asked Freeman to be her health secretary – a portfolio the first minister herself held for five years under Alex Salmond – after Shona Robison resigned following mounting pressure from opposition parties over the performance of NHS Scotland.

Of the challenge, Freeman says: “I have a personal and family background in the health service, and I have nothing but admiration for every person who works in our NHS whatever their job is. There have always been challenges and demands on the NHS and that will continue.
China Mobile has reportedly been censoring content banned by the Chinese government’s “great firewall,” even when Chinese citizens are in the United States — prompting the FCC to debate its license. According to the Washington Post, on Monday, the U.S. Department of Commerce “recommended the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) deny a license to China Mobile, the state-run company that is the world’s largest phone network by subscribers.”
“The Commerce Department suggested the move because of the national security risk China Mobile poses,” they explained, adding that China Mobile is an “arm of the Chinese state,” and that “those with China Mobile as their carrier are often unable to access American websites and apps that are banned in China.”
One Chinese journalist was reportedly unable to access Facebook, the New York Times, and Google Maps from their phone while in the United States. Another user, Shanghai analyst May Sun, warned that the “Great Firewall” doesn’t stop when you enter the United States as a Chinese citizen. “[It] is exactly the same as when you surf on the Internet at home,” May Sun declared. “You still don’t have access to what is blocked by the Great Firewall.”
In a statement, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) called China Mobile an “unacceptable risk.”
“Granting the authorization poses an unacceptable risk to U.S. national security and law enforcement,” NTIA proclaimed.
“They’ve twisted American values,” she said in a follow-up phone interview. “A lot of them are anti-God, anti-religion and anti-military.”

Durbin’s advocacy for mass-migration and for younger ‘dreamer’ illegals has caused the Democrats much political pain. He pushed for the abortive budget-shutdown in January 2018, and for the “Gang of Eight” amnesty bill in 2013 which helped the Democrats lose nine seats in 2014. The Democrats’ top leader in the Senate, Sen. Chuck Schumer, is keeping his distance from the “Abolish ICE” campaign. He is instead using his Twitter account to tout Democrats’ promises on healthcare, guns, gay status, and claims that President Donald Trump is tied to Russian President Vladimir Putin. On the Abolish ICE campaign, Schumer is instead calling for a “czar” to focus media attention on “reunifying families.” That topic polls better for Democrats than ending immigration enforcement.

LONDON — Over the past century American and British troops have fought side-by-side in two World Wars, Korea and the conflicts in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan.

"A man who grows accustomed to the use of contraceptive methods may forget the reverence due to a woman," the pope wrote, "... and reduce her to a mere instrument of his own desires." "This document that has been so controversial and in many places reviled," Eberstadt says, "actually called the shots on what the future would look like better than any other single source I could think of." Revisionist views of the 1968 encyclical have even taken hold among some Catholics who have not abided by its teaching.

While Blackstone Vice President Tony James offered some useful common-sense economic and political advice for Democrats, it was a bit of a head-scratcher to read his unsubstantiated declaration that “some of the current expansion is built on the foundation laid by the Obama administration.” Mr. James’s praise for the previous administration sounds a lot like the laughable claim by President Obama himself that America’s current economic vitality and growth are really due to the fact that he had the economy “set up well” for Mr. Trump. If by “set up well,” President Obama meant that the economy had been driven so far into the ground and smothered by excessive regulation and high taxes that almost anything that followed his antibusiness policies would be a success, then there would have been some merit in his claim. But does anyone think that’s what he’s saying?While Blackstone Vice President Tony James offered some useful common-sense economic and political advice for Democrats, it was a bit of a head-scratcher to read his unsubstantiated declaration that “some of the current expansion is built on the foundation laid by the Obama administration.” Mr. James’s praise for the previous administration sounds a lot like the laughable claim by President Obama himself that America’s current economic vitality and growth are really due to the fact that he had the economy “set up well” for Mr. Trump.While Blackstone Vice President Tony James offered some useful common-sense economic and political advice for Democrats, it was a bit of a head-scratcher to read his unsubstantiated declaration that “some of the current expansion is built on the foundation laid by the Obama administration.” Mr. James’s praise for the previous administration sounds a lot like the laughable claim by President Obama himself that America’s current economic vitality and growth are really due to the fact that he had the economy “set up well” for Mr. Trump.
Tesla could use a lighter moment. It has had a 2018 filled with ups and downs. In May, Consumer Reports initially did not recommend the electric vehicle giant’s Model 3, its first car priced for mainstream buyers, in part because of long stopping distances, only to see the magazine relent after it flashed software to cars that improved them. Last month, Tesla topped a list of best-selling electric vehicles in the United States, selling three of the five most popular cars. And this week, Tesla announced that it had reached Musk's goal of manufacturing 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week.
The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives. At first there was talk about a much bigger pot of money -- $100 million or more. When the bill was reintroduced this year, the amount was $20 million. By the end of the legislative session, it was down to $5 million.
The services sector, where most Americans are employed, has now expanded for 101 consecutive months, or more than eight years. The gain was better than many economists had been expecting and depicts an overall economy that appears to be regaining momentum after a slowdown in the winter.

At least 41 alleged injuries have been reported, but NHTSA has yet to publicly offer any answers. Now at the two-year anniversary of the investigation, safety advocates are expressing frustration over the limited information coming out of NHTSA, reports CBS News correspondent Kris Van Cleave. Following our reports and the decision by a number of police departments to start parking Explorers, Ford began offering a free repair if a customer asks for it. The automaker claims it "effectively resolves" the problem. NHTSA has received almost 200 complaints about the issue.
But sex-worker-rights campaigners say the proposal would be "a disaster". Three organisations - the Sex Worker Advocacy and Resistance Movement (Swarm), the English Collective of Prostitutes (ECP), and the xTalk collective - are planning a demonstration outside Parliament at the time of this Wednesday's debate to protest against the suggested law change. They describe the idea as being a "Trump-inspired" effort to kick sex workers off the internet and put them into "more exploitative and harmful situations". New platforms
The debate follows an official report into sexual exploitation in England and Wales, which was published in May. It concluded that prostitution procurement websites were "the most significant enabler of sex-trafficking in the UK".
Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.
But that no-deportations policy would allow many companies to hire illegals instead of Americans. That subsequent rush of migrants would force down wages for Americans and for legal immigrants, force up rents and housing prices, and also overcrowd public K-12 schools. Polls show that no-deportations policy is radioactive among swing voters and ut congressional actions show it is quietly supported by many GOP and Democratic politicians . B
Trump’s campaign to limit legal and illegal immigration is driving up wages and salaries for Americans in various locations and careers around the country.
He described “unbelievably bad border laws, immigration laws” in the United States, calling them “the weakest in the world, laughed at by everybody in the world.” He contrasted the U.S. immigration laws with “Mexico’s very strong immigration laws.”
Trump suggested that Mexico can help the United States “until we straighten out our immigration laws, which have been bad for many, many years, decades.” He further assured, “We’re gonna have them taken care of.”

Eric Young, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees’ Council of Prison Locals, now prays before he looks at his phone every morning, worried he’ll receive a message from BOP’s director notifying him of a staff death. Young estimates that around two-thirds of his union members were Trump supporters. That makes sense: It’s a law enforcement agency that leans white and male (72 percent male, 62 percent white), and many federal prisons are in rural parts of the country, which Trump dominated. But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau. BOP has long suffered the kind of problems you’d expect for a massive bureaucracy centered on caging tens of thousands of people.
They are even now talking about two other former Kennedy clerks for the Supreme Court, Judges Brett Kavanaugh and Ray Kethledge. And they've put a bunch of Kennedy clerks onto the lower courts. And they seem to exploit some connections between the Kennedy and Trump families. Justice Kennedy's son, Justin, had business dealings with President Trump. Ivanka Trump visited the Supreme Court at Justice Kennedy's invitation after the two of them met after the inauguration.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
The economy has added an average 207,000 jobs a month this year after a blowout number of 223,000 in May. Economists predict that 195,000 jobs were added in June. Unemployment stands at 3.8%, the lowest rate since 2000. If it dips to 3.7%, it will be the lowest since 1969.

3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.
But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said. Tackett said he's concerned about children, especially in Eastern Kentucky, which has a higher rate of Medicaid patients and some of the state's worst oral health. "I have no problem with them regulating the adults that are on Medicaid," Tackett said. "If they are young and healthy, they should be out working or doing something.

Trump’s campaign to limit legal and illegal immigration is driving up wages and salaries for Americans in various locations and careers around the country. The beneficiaries include new employees, African-American bakers in Chicago, Latino restaurant workers in Monterey, Calif., disabled people nationwide, high schoolers, resort workers in Hilton Head, construction workers, Superbowl workers, the garment industry, and workers at small businesses, and even Warren Buffett’s railroad workers. Amnesty advocates rely on business-funded “Nation of Immigrants” push-polls to show apparent voter support for immigration and immigrants. But “choice” polls reveal most voters’ often-ignored preference that CEOs should hire Americans at decent wages before hiring migrants.

And we will say, ‘I will give you a million dollars to your favorite charity, paid for by Trump, if you take the test and it shows you’re an Indian. “And let’s see what she does. I have a feeling she will say no, but we’ll hold that for the debates,” Trump concluded. You can watch the video of Trump calling out Senator Warren for her false heritage claims at his Montana rally Thursday night here:
President Trump has just said in the past week he's going to raise things like Syria, like Ukraine, like the election meddling issue, really the whole range of issues between us. And I think that, in the president's mind, this is very important, because it gives him an opportunity to size up Vladimir Putin, to see where there are areas where we might make progress together and where there are areas where we may not. BRENNAN: Well, right now, Russia is blanket-bombing Southern Syria. That violates the last agreement Vladimir Putin made with President Trump. Why would he believe that he's in any way trustworthy?
Over the fireplace at Mingo Creek Craft Distillers, a whiskey purveyor in the small town of Washington, Pennsylvania, a portrait of Alexander Hamilton hangs upside down. With snowy hair and a black velvet jacket, Hamilton wears an impassive look that might be described as hauteur. In 1791, to pay off debts the newly formed United States incurred during the revolutionary war, Hamilton imposed the first federal tax on the people of the region. By taxing their most lucrative product, whiskey, he became what he is here today: a villain representing the excesses of the federal government. The town of Washington is only a six-hour drive from Manhattan, but it’s a world away from the Broadway stage where Hamilton, clad in snug white knickers, enjoys a better reputation.
Hamilton, the Republican state lawmaker who beat the incumbent Karnes, won with a mix of support from teachers and other unions. While Karnes sparred with teachers during the strike, Hamilton took a moderate position. He aligned with teachers unions by opposing state right-to-work legislation and the proposed repeal of prevailing wage laws for public construction projects. The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.
Pentagon Questioned Over Blackout On War Zone Troop Numbers
Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images
For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.
I also thought that liberals chose more regulation and higher taxes despite this cause-and-effect relationship. Now I discover that they don’t even understand it.

A California city official sparked outrage this weekend after calling for July to be designated “Straight Pride American Month” in an essay that appeared in a local newspaper and on his personal website. The June 29 installment of Dixon Vice Mayor Ted Hickman’s column, “That’s Life,” contained a number of slurs against LGBTQ people and other eyebrow-raising language. Blasting June as “LGBTQF-WTF month,” Hickman suggested “Straight Pride American Month,” or “SPAM,” as a time for “healthy, heterosexual, fairly monogamous, keep our kinky stuff to ourselves Americans” to be celebrated nationwide. “Don’t get me wrong I support the First Amendment, as much as the next person, and support the rights of grown men to wear skin tight short-shorts and go-go boots and don tinker bell wings with wand and prance down the streets of San Francisco,” Hickman wrote. Ted Hickman should be ashamed for sharing such an awful message... Dixon, CA needs to do better.
That came on the heels of 0.9 percent drop in March, the first monthly drop since July of 2017. Total private construction rose 0.3 percent, with residential projects up 0.8 percent in May. New single-family home construction rose 0.6 percent and the volatile apartment building sector jumped 1.6 percent. Private, non-residential building fell 0.3 percent. Economists are forecasting that construction spending will contribute to overall growth this year even though interest rates are rising.
"It's not a unique business," Troia said. "In this case, they just got caught with the door open." Two days after news of that leak broke, a data breach at the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training at Texas State University exposed the personal information of thousands of law enforcement officers. In that case, which was first reported by ZDNet, the personal info was stored on an unsecured web server, a university spokesman told CNNMoney. Data breaches can happen to anyone, of course -- just ask Equifax (EFX), which experienced a hack that exposed the personal information of over 147 million people last fall.
Do you think this could actually come before the Supreme Court (INAUDIBLE)? I mean the issue of immigration?
They include the United States withdrawing its 28,500 troops in South Korea, ending its military drills with South Korea and stop bringing in strategic assets such as aircraft carriers and nuclear-capable bombers. North Korea hasn't repeated such specific demands since entering disarmament talks earlier this year, raising optimism that the country truly appeared to seek to improve ties with the United States. After the summit, Trump suspended annual military training with South Korea that the North has called an invasion rehearsal. But North Korea still prefers a step-by-step disarmament process with reciprocal concessions and benefits from the United States for each of the North's denuclearization steps. The ultimate rewards North Korea wants range from the easing or lifting of American-led international sanctions, the signing of a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, the establishment of diplomatic ties and the pulling out of U.S. troops in South Korea, experts say.
Full-service restaurants with more elaborate menus and more complex processes, like the Red Hen and those in The Trump Organization properties, are more vulnerable to violations than fast-food eateries with limited food offerings and a streamlined kitchen production line, said Craig Hedberg, a professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Minnesota. And those with repeated violations can get into even more trouble with their local health departments, said Hedberg. Those eateries will be flagged by inspectors, who bring copies of previous reports on their visits and can spot patterns of regulation flouting. How repeat offenses are handled differs by jurisdiction. “It’s very rare to see a perfect score,” he said.

Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.

Party officials describe Earnheart as a "lifelong Democrat" who voted for Trump because he didn’t like Hillary Clinton.

"Unlike our forerunners in 1968, those of us living today have access to something they didn't," said Mary Eberstadt, a widely published Catholic writer, "50 years of sociological, psychological, medical, and other evidence about the revolution's fallout." Some of the lines in Humanae Vitae, when stripped of mid-20th century cultural references, find echoes in contemporary concerns about nonconsensual sexual relations. "A man who grows accustomed to the use of contraceptive methods may forget the reverence due to a woman," the pope wrote, "... and reduce her to a mere instrument of his own desires." "This document that has been so controversial and in many places reviled," Eberstadt says, "actually called the shots on what the future would look like better than any other single source I could think of." Revisionist views of the 1968 encyclical have even taken hold among some Catholics who have not abided by its teaching.

In the survey, most say they are proud to be Americans, although Republicans feel that way more strongly (90 percent) than Democrats (61 percent). There is no consensus when asked about the country’s current course, though: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. “Overwhelming majorities of those in both parties and independents agree that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.”” USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll

In addition, a group of incumbent Democrats – including U.S. Rep. Brian Higgins of New York and Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania – say they won’t back Pelosi for another term as party leader. "Our leadership is out of touch with what is going on, not only in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan but in Cheektowaga, West Seneca, Hamburg, Orchard Park and Lancaster," Higgins told the Buffalo News, referring to swing states that voted for Donald Trump in 2016, as well as municipalities near Buffalo. "Our leadership is out of touch with what is going on ... in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan ... " - U.S. Rep. Brian Higgins, D-N.Y.
Perhaps the biggest blow to Pelosi’s future prospects occurred last Tuesday in New York City, when 28-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeated longtime U.S. Rep. Joseph Crowley, 56, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. To many political watchers, it suggested that Democratic voters have grown tired of the party’s old guard and want a new generation of leaders. But Pelosi quickly dismissed Ocasio-Cortez’s upset victory as a “one district” fluke – a comment that may serve only to further inspire the younger, more far-left candidates seeking to move on Pelosi and her contemporaries."Our leadership is out of touch with what is going on ... in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan ...

The report says the combined value of metallurgical and thermal coal exports will be $60.2bn in 2017-18, behind iron ore at $61.8bn. It says coal exports will be slightly lower at $58.1bn in 2018-19, and that iron ore earnings will be even lower at $57.7bn, as falling iron ore prices drive export earnings lower. The Australian characterised that event as coal reclaiming its mantle as the nation’s “top export earner”. But the report says coal export earnings will soon drop below those for iron ore again, as global coal prices fall. India's huge solar ambitions could push coal further into shade Read more
In 2019-20 coal export earnings will be just $51.1bn, while iron ore earnings will be $55.4bn.
She worried that giving birth to this child would leave her so tainted that no man would ever want her as his wife. In a panic, she told her mother, who swiftly took her to a clinic for an abortion.

On the Fourth of July, 1852, America celebrated its freedom, as it does every Independence Day. Frederick Douglass, America’s most famous anti-slavery activist and fugitive slave, saw no ground to celebrate: he saw the octopus arms of slavery stretched everywhere, exposing the hollowness of America’s freedom values. That holiday, he delivered the greatest antislavery speech in American history. Not least since the racism that made slavery endures.
'We’re going to run different'
His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
He said the agency will investigate how those calls were handled. "If we failed in any way, shape or form, that is unacceptable," Penzone added. "But we're not ultimately the ones responsible when an individual decides to take the act of using a firearm or other weapon to take another life.

LONDON — Over the past century American and British troops have fought side-by-side in two World Wars, Korea and the conflicts in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan. But some lawmakers and experts in the United Kingdom are warning that the British military could soon be seen as irrelevant by the United States unless it receives a colossal funding boost.

Hamilton, the Republican state lawmaker who beat the incumbent Karnes, won with a mix of support from teachers and other unions. While Karnes sparred with teachers during the strike, Hamilton took a moderate position. He aligned with teachers unions by opposing state right-to-work legislation and the proposed repeal of prevailing wage laws for public construction projects. The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
Wilmette resident Dr. Tara Troy attended Rush University Medical School and the University of Chicago for a residency and fellowship. Troy is married to Jon Powell, a fellow physician and they have two daughters, Kyra, 13 and Taylor, 10. She expects to open up her own gastroenterology practice in Northbrook later this year. Q: Why did you decide to start your own practice? A: I wanted to get back to that small, more meaningful environment and communication where the patient and the staff know each other by name.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
“Regardless of political parties, we need people to make a decision about what’s happening in the classroom,” said Marisol Garcia, vice president of the Arizona Education Association. “To limit ourselves and to say ‘only these people are going to support us’ is just not true.”
Teachers can be at a disadvantage compared to wealthier candidates, who tend to have built-in networks of potential donors. The NEA’s Eskelsen Garcia experienced that firsthand when she ran for Congress in Utah in 1998, recalling mystified looks and wary questions from people trying to figure out who was bankrolling her (she lost to the Republican nominee in the general election). But teachers, especially experienced ones, can benefit from their network of former students and their real-life connection to middle-class voters. “As a teacher married to a teacher, I know what it’s like to work paycheck to paycheck,” said Tom Niermann, a teacher running to unseat Rep. Kevin Yoder (R-Kan.) in suburban Kansas City.
The vast majority of swing voters across the United States oppose the Democrats’ latest plan to abolish all immigration enforcement by ending the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. In recent weeks, Democrats in the House and Senate, along with progressive liberals like Cynthia Nixon in New York and most recently insurgent Democrat candidate for Congress, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have been demanding ICE be abolished and all immigration enforcement be ended. House Democrats are now crafting legislation that would officially abolish ICE. The latest Harvard/Harris Poll, though, reveals that swing voters are overwhelmingly opposed to the Democrats’ plan to end all immigration enforcement across the U.S.
Nearly 3-in-4 swing voters, about 73 percent, of swing voters said they do not want ICE to be disbanded. Less than 30 percent of swing voters said they support the abolishment of ICE.
Nebraska May Join Utah, Idaho in Putting Medicaid Expansion Before Voters

Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.

He recently committed to fully representing a mother who has not spoken to her six-year-old child in three weeks.

But, unlike the wind industry which has settled on a three-blade design, underwater designers are also testing four and six-bladed versions too. OpenHydro, already deployed in Canada’s Bay of Fundy, use giant 16m hoops with inward-pointing blades that resemble the mouth of a giant lamprey fish. Its makers opened the world’s first tidal turbine manufacturing plant in Cherbourg last week. There are also vertical turbines that spin like a fairground carousel, such as Hydroquest in France and LHD in China, and one company is even making an undulating membrane inspired by swimming fish. Capturing wave power is even more challenging than tapping the tides – “survivability” is the key term in this sector.
Part of its mission is to provide local veterans with a monthly ration of what he calls medical-grade cannabis free of charge. It started back in 2011.

The office where he's sorting the cannabis sits above one of their grow operations.

Leah Millis / Reuters Discussing school shootings, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told community leaders in his home state of Kentucky, “I don’t think at the federal level there’s much that we can do other than appropriate funds.”
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday he thinks the federal government can’t do much to help stop school shootings. “I don’t think at the federal level there’s much that we can do other than appropriate funds,” McConnell said while speaking to community leaders in Danville, Kentucky, the Lexington Herald-Leader reports. McConnell said he feels heightened security in schools may help prevent shootings but argued that’s not the responsibility of the U.S. Congress. “You would think, given how much it takes to get on an American plane or given how much it takes to get into courthouses, that this might be something that we could achieve, but I don’t think we could do that from Washington, I think it’s basically a local decision,” he said. “It’s a darn shame that’s where we are, but this epidemic is something that’s got all of our attention,” he added.

That came on the heels of 0.9 percent drop in March, the first monthly drop since July of 2017. Total private construction rose 0.3 percent, with residential projects up 0.8 percent in May.

Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey has apologised to Parliament for making "inadvertently misleading" statements about Universal Credit. She said she had "mistakenly" told MPs on Monday the National Audit Office felt the benefit was progressing too slowly and should be rolled out faster. The head of the spending watchdog had said the claims were "incorrect" as it had reservations about the process. Labour had called on Ms McVey to apologise or "consider her position". Ms McVey told MPs that she had meant to say that the spending watchdog believed there was "no practical alternative" to the development of Universal Credit, which rolls six benefits into one.
They are even now talking about two other former Kennedy clerks for the Supreme Court, Judges Brett Kavanaugh and Ray Kethledge. And they've put a bunch of Kennedy clerks onto the lower courts.

Ivanka Trump visited the Supreme Court at Justice Kennedy's invitation after the two of them met after the inauguration.

This is just terrible timing all around." Medicaid, an $11 billion, state-federal health plan in Kentucky, covers 1.4 million people, about 600,000 of them children. The federal government provides about 80 percent of the state's Medicaid funds. The cuts to dental and vision benefits were supposed to affect only able-bodied adults, mostly those added to Medicaid under an expansion authorized through the Affordable Care Act.
3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.
Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
The Republican Party is rotting away. The problem is that GOP policies just aren’t popular. Most Americans unsurprisingly oppose climate denial, tax cuts for the wealthy, and putting children (including toddlers) in concentration camps, for example. The Republican Party has thus far managed to continue winning elections by creating “a coalition between racists and plutocrats,” as Paul Krugman put it. The party’s economic policies are aimed at benefitting wealthy individuals and corporations, but that’s a slim segment of the American electorate.

Norway says the number of asylum seekers from Turkey has increased noticeably in recent weeks, and officials say it will take time to process them because Oslo needs to check other countries' practices in similar cases. Frode Forfang, head of Norway's Directorate of Immigration, says many have claimed political persecution at home because of links to U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who is blamed by Turkey for the 2016 failed coup. The agency said that 245 Turkish nationals have sought shelter in Norway so far in 2018, including 142 arriving in June. That compares to a total of 164 Turkish nationals who sought asylum in Norway in 2017. The agency offered no explanation for the June increase.
Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.

The woman who took Kinner in was not harmed and was not at the residence at the time of the attack. Kinner assaulted the children at the party after he was unable to find the woman, police said, adding his motive was still under investigation. “This was an attack against those who are the most vulnerable, our children. It’s untenable, unconscionable and is pure evil,” Bones said. The children who were attacked ranged in age from three to 12, Bones said.

Split those revenues, with 35 percent going to K-12 education, 35 percent to roads, 15 percent to the communities that allow marijuana businesses in their communities and 15 percent to counties where marijuana business are located. Allow communities to decide whether they’ll allow marijuana businesses in their towns.

The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.

By the end of the legislative session, it was down to $5 million.

While other data on Thursday showed private payrolls rising less than expected last month and a surprise increase in new applications for unemployment benefits last week, overall labor market conditions continue to tighten. The labor market is considered to be near or at full employment, with the jobless rate at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent. The unemployment rate has dropped by three-tenths of a percentage point this year and is near the Federal Reserve’s forecast of 3.6 percent by the end of this year.

Pentagon Questioned Over Blackout On War Zone Troop Numbers

For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.
In one case, Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion that illegal immigrants do not have the same bargaining rights as American citizens and legal workers. “… an illegal immigrant worker is not an ’employee’ under the NLRA for the simple reason that, ever since 1986, an illegal immigrant worker is not a lawful ’employee’ in the United States,” Kavanaugh wrote. In another case, Kavanaugh noted that American multi-national corporations do not have the right to import foreign workers. The Circuit judge explained, “Under the provision of the immigration laws at issue here, mere economic expediency does not authorize an employer to displace American workers for foreign workers.”
Prominent conservative Ann Coulter has also called for Trump to nominate Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, arguing that other judges such as Thomas Hardiman and Raymond Kethledge “are open borders zealots.”

"But when I pointed out to Cohen that he wasn’t repeating past vows to 'take a bullet' and 'do anything' to protect the president, the longtime Trump loyalist left little doubt about where he stands now, saying simply: 'To be crystal clear, my wife, my daughter and my son, and this country have my first loyalty.'
"Unlike our forerunners in 1968, those of us living today have access to something they didn't," said Mary Eberstadt, a widely published Catholic writer, "50 years of sociological, psychological, medical, and other evidence about the revolution's fallout." Some of the lines in Humanae Vitae, when stripped of mid-20th century cultural references, find echoes in contemporary concerns about nonconsensual sexual relations. "A man who grows accustomed to the use of contraceptive methods may forget the reverence due to a woman," the pope wrote, "... and reduce her to a mere instrument of his own desires." "This document that has been so controversial and in many places reviled," Eberstadt says, "actually called the shots on what the future would look like better than any other single source I could think of." Revisionist views of the 1968 encyclical have even taken hold among some Catholics who have not abided by its teaching.
It's difficult to imagine Old Hickory, as he was known, excusing himself from military duty on the grounds that he could not march long distances, as Mr Trump did during the Vietnam War, citing bone spurs.

Fillmore launched his career in the 1820s with the Anti-Masonic Party, hawking a paranoid rumour that ruling Freemasons were murdering whistleblowers.

Even Pruitt’s own staff had begun to sour on him, with many worrying that their future career prospects would be damaged by their association with Pruitt’s tenure. Each scandal seemed more damning than the last. Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report says Democrats are "likely" to carry Montana in the Senate race. Inside Elections rates the contest as one that "tilts Democratic." After the rally, the spokesman for Tester's re-election campaign put out a statement that was critical of Rosendale but which did not mention the president. "Jon's record is clear—if it's good for Montana, Jon works with anyone from either party to get things done. If it's bad for Montana, he'll stand up to anyone," Tester spokesman Chris Meagher said.

Hall apologised, saying it was a “silly thing to say and not a reflection of who I am ... I have nothing but respect for women”. Gee, we’ve heard that before. Nothing but respect for women. Leyonhjelm won’t even say sorry, can’t even see that saying “men should stop raping women” is not comparable to “all men are rapists”.

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York said ICE has "become a deportation force," telling CNN late Thursday "you should get rid of it, start over, reimagine it and build something that actually works." Rep. Mark Pocan, a Democrat from Wisconsin, stated last week that he plans to introduce legislation to eliminate ICE. Trump tweeted Saturday morning that Democrats "are making a strong push to abolish ICE, one of the smartest, toughest and most spirited law enforcement groups of men and women that I have ever seen." In an interview that aired over the weekend with Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo, Trump added that “we have to have strong borders. We don’t want crime…The Democrats want to have no borders.

Critics argue, though, that while Trump has picked the right fight, he has chosen the wrong weapon. They predict China will defy an array of U.S. tariffs set to take effect Friday and will retaliate immediately. And they warn that the escalating trade war will slow global growth and jeopardize the second-longest economic expansion in U.S. history. Many analysts say the United States should have enlisted key allies like Japan and the European Union — which share U.S. complaints about Chinese trade policies — to impose unified pressure on Beijing. Instead, the U.S. is engaging in trade disputes with its friends over imported steel, aluminum and autos.
Azar said that once children and parents are reunited, they will be held in DHS custody. He added that he plans to request additional time from the court "to ensure that we can do the job that we believe is necessary to protect the children in our care." Rose and NPR's Tom Bowman reported last month that the Department of Defense is planning to build "tent encampments on two military bases in Texas to house migrant families apprehended at the border."

The NHS will consume 66% of the Welsh budget by 2048 if demand increases in line with predicted demand, according to new research. Health economist Prof Ceri Phillips said spending on the NHS would need to rise by 4% a year. Currently £6bn out of a total Welsh budget of £14.5bn goes to the NHS. The Welsh Government said its Health and Social Care Plan aimed to reduce demand through more people managing their own health and well-being. BBC Wales Investigates had asked Prof Phillips, from Swansea University, to question existing projections for healthcare in Wales and then calculate how much extra spending would be needed to keep the NHS afloat.
The program, also known as a white hat operation, was part of a broader plan to get the company to treat disinformation campaigns by governments differently than it did more traditional problems such as spam, which is aimed at tricking individual users as opposed to shaping the political climate in an entire country, according to these people. Harvey said she had not heard of the operation. Some executives initially were reluctant to act aggressively against suspected fake accounts and raised questions about the legality of doing so, said the people familiar with internal company debates. In November, one frustrated engineer sought to illustrate the severity of the problem by buying thousands of fake followers for a Twitter manager, said two people familiar with the episode. Bots can be readily purchased on a gray market of websites.

CONSERVATIVE STUDENT’S PARTING SHOT AT COLLEGE’S ANTI-GUN POLICIES GOES VIRAL: ‘COME AND TAKE IT’
“I wanted to draw attention to the gun policies on campus that allow guests to open carry, but not students,” she told Fox News. “I find it insulting that the school values the lives of their guests more than those attending the university for four years.”
She received death threats because of her post but said she had no regrets. “Don’t you dare celebrate Independence Day if you won’t respect the right to bear arms and the other values that our country was founded on,” Bennett also tweeted. “The purpose of this day is to commemorate the fight for freedom and defiance to government tyranny.”
“Yes, it was,” he replied. However, Howden rejected the suggestion he had “created a situation” for such gross abuse to occur with posters stating “every salesman for themselves”. That was due to poor training and KPIs and incentive schemes that at one stage included a refer-a-friend program for customers with attached commissions abused by salespeople. On offer for the company’s top performers were a $300 gift card, a “Pacific Pearl” Sunshine Coast cruise, a $6,000 Vespa scooter and Sunshine Coast cruise. It was about the same time that the number of Aboriginal people signed up to funeral plans leapt from 430 to 1491 over the course of a year.
He said the agency will investigate how those calls were handled. "If we failed in any way, shape or form, that is unacceptable," Penzone added. "But we're not ultimately the ones responsible when an individual decides to take the act of using a firearm or other weapon to take another life. It is that individual's responsibility; they own that act." After the fatal shooting, deputies searched the home and found 13 firearms, 11 of which belonged to the victim and two that belonged to Blessing.
Hamilton, the Republican state lawmaker who beat the incumbent Karnes, won with a mix of support from teachers and other unions. While Karnes sparred with teachers during the strike, Hamilton took a moderate position. He aligned with teachers unions by opposing state right-to-work legislation and the proposed repeal of prevailing wage laws for public construction projects. The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.

Their kids have just been kidnapped. How do you prepare for your [asylum case?] Carlos García, immigration lawyer,
On top of his private practice, García plans to visit Port Isabel a few times a week, which is an hour and a half drive from his office, to give migrants legal advice. He recently committed to fully representing a mother who has not spoken to her six-year-old child in three weeks. García says he’s tempted to take on more cases every time he visits the detention center, and he receives a few emails every day from other lawyers about someone else in need of an attorney.

Nielsen founded her own consulting firm, called Sunesis Consulting; she brought on a Bush administration colleague, Elizabeth Neumann, as managing partner, and eventually expanded the suburban Washington firm to 15 people. She continued consulting on cybersecurity issues, becoming a senior fellow at The George Washington University’s Center for Cyber & Homeland Security, and working on reports and presentations on that issue and others for the World Economic Forum—the Swiss nonprofit that puts on an annual summit for global economic heavyweights in Davos, Switzerland. ***
While still running her own consulting firm in late 2016, Nielsen volunteered to advise the Trump transition team on homeland security policy. She met John Kelly during that time, and he tapped her to assist him—also as a volunteer—in his confirmation process for DHS secretary.
“The consensus is you are giving up a lot of control,” she said. That sentiment is growing in the advertising industry.

As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.
But sex-worker-rights campaigners say the proposal would be "a disaster". Three organisations - the Sex Worker Advocacy and Resistance Movement (Swarm), the English Collective of Prostitutes (ECP), and the xTalk collective - are planning a demonstration outside Parliament at the time of this Wednesday's debate to protest against the suggested law change. They describe the idea as being a "Trump-inspired" effort to kick sex workers off the internet and put them into "more exploitative and harmful situations". New platforms
The debate follows an official report into sexual exploitation in England and Wales, which was published in May. It concluded that prostitution procurement websites were "the most significant enabler of sex-trafficking in the UK".
Mrs May said she would not comment on a leaked report that the government had not yet seen. She said the government would consider it when it received it. (you can read the BBC story on it here)
She then said all donations to the Scottish Conservatives were accepted and declared in accordance with the law after Mr Blackford accused the party of "systematically shielding donations from public scrutiny". Referring to reports on the Ferret website, he alleged the Scottish Conservatives had received £319,000 from the Scottish Unionist Association Trust and said there was no information about who manages the trust, who its donors are or its assets. He urged the prime minister to reveal what checks had taken place before the money was accepted and for an investigation.

Trump’s campaign to limit legal and illegal immigration is driving up wages and salaries for Americans in various locations and careers around the country. The beneficiaries include new employees, African-American bakers in Chicago, Latino restaurant workers in Monterey, Calif., disabled people nationwide, high schoolers, resort workers in Hilton Head, construction workers, Superbowl workers, the garment industry, and workers at small businesses, and even Warren Buffett’s railroad workers. Amnesty advocates rely on business-funded “Nation of Immigrants” push-polls to show apparent voter support for immigration and immigrants. But “choice” polls reveal most voters’ often-ignored preference that CEOs should hire Americans at decent wages before hiring migrants.

It was described as a tense meeting, the BBC's Norman Smith said. Mrs May is trying to find an arrangement to unite her cabinet when ministers gather at her country retreat, Chequers, on Friday. The UK is leaving the EU in March 2019, but has yet to agree how it will trade with the remaining EU members - who are part of a single market and a customs union - in years to come. Some former Remain campaigners want the government to pursue close ties to the EU to avoid barriers to trade with Europe - but Eurosceptics say the UK needs freedom to set its own independent trade policy. After two alternative models for customs were criticised, Downing Street has come up with what it calls a "third way" solution to be presented on Friday, claiming it will offer "the best of both worlds" - frictionless trade with Europe and the freedom to strike international trade deals.
Republican Senate candidate and Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley launched a new website on Tuesday attacking incumbent Sen.

In one case, Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion that illegal immigrants do not have the same bargaining rights as American citizens and legal workers. “… an illegal immigrant worker is not an ’employee’ under the NLRA for the simple reason that, ever since 1986, an illegal immigrant worker is not a lawful ’employee’ in the United States,” Kavanaugh wrote. In another case, Kavanaugh noted that American multi-national corporations do not have the right to import foreign workers. The Circuit judge explained, “Under the provision of the immigration laws at issue here, mere economic expediency does not authorize an employer to displace American workers for foreign workers.”
Prominent conservative Ann Coulter has also called for Trump to nominate Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, arguing that other judges such as Thomas Hardiman and Raymond Kethledge “are open borders zealots.”

Corporate America couldn’t hire Republican lobbyists fast enough after President Donald Trump’s election gave the GOP unified control of Washington. Now there are signs that Democrats are back in demand. Companies and trade groups are trying to hire congressional staffers with ties to influential House Democrats four months ahead of the midterm elections, in which Democrats are expected to pick up seats and potentially retake control of the House. Lobbyists are helping their clients meet with the Democrats who would become committee chairs if the party does win back the chamber. And trade groups are talking to members about what to expect from a Democratic takeover.
3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.

"Peace and tranquility are the fruits of justice," Lopez Obrador said. Exit polling by Consulta Mitofsky for the Televisa network forecast gubernatorial wins for allies of Lopez Obrador's Morena party in at least four of eight state races on the ballot plus for the head of government in Mexico City. The central state of Guanajuato was expected to go to a candidate of the conservative National Action Party. Mitofsky predicted Morena allies would take between 56 and 70 seats in the 128-member Senate and between 256 and 291 spots in the 500-seat lower house. "The anger that the average Mexican feels toward the way things are being governed has favored Lopez Obrador," said Shannon O'Neil, senior fellow for Latin America Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.
It's difficult to imagine Old Hickory, as he was known, excusing himself from military duty on the grounds that he could not march long distances, as Mr Trump did during the Vietnam War, citing bone spurs. The parallels between the 45th president and the 13th - unlucky for some - are arguably more compelling. Fillmore launched his career in the 1820s with the Anti-Masonic Party, hawking a paranoid rumour that ruling Freemasons were murdering whistleblowers. Mr Trump paved the way for his White House bid by peddling a conspiracy theory, too - that President Barack Obama was not a US citizen.

The strategy reprises last year's successful approach to confirming Justice Neil Gorsuch in the early spring of 2017. Gorsuch was named to fill the vacancy left by the death of Antonin Scalia and then kept open by the refusal of the Senate's Republican majority to consider Merrick Garland, the replacement named by President Barack Obama in 2016. Gorsuch was greeted with delight by abortion opponents, even though he had not ruled directly on Roe in his judicial career. But his confirmation was far from a sure thing because two Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, were seen as defenders of abortion rights.

Circuit by President George W. Bush. "Rather, the issuance of injunctive relief in this case serves only to hold Defendants accountable to their own governing policies and to ensure that Plaintiffs receive the protections they are due under the Parole Directive." The lawsuits was filed in March by legal groups representing nine jailed asylum-seekers. The plaintiffs include an ethics teacher from Haiti who was attacked after teaching his class about government corruption, a Venezuelan who was threatened for participating in marches opposing the country's communist government, and a gay Honduran man who was threatened at gunpoint. One has been held in U.S. custody for over two years.
The problem is so pervasive that a lawmaker recently asked El Salvador's Legislative Assembly for national identity cards to be issued without addresses "to save lives." Fifteen years ago, the Salvadoran government began a crackdown on gangs, resulting in thousands of members being imprisoned. Yet they continued to proliferate, even running operations with cell phones from behind bars. El Salvador's defense minister said in 2015 there were 60,000 gang members in the country, compared to a combined police and army strength of 50,000. Members of those security forces contribute to the violence that is causing the northward migration.

Five children 15 and younger were among 23 people shot during a scorching weekend in Chicago. From Friday afternoon to early Monday, 21 people were wounded and two people were killed, including a 14-year-old boy who was shot early Saturday while walking in the Washington Park neighborhood, according to police. About nine hours earlier, another 14-year-old boy was shot in the Loop. He was coming up stairs at the corner of Wabash Avenue and Wacker Drive when he was shot in the leg Friday evening, police said.

Last month, Tesla topped a list of best-selling electric vehicles in the United States, selling three of the five most popular cars. And this week, Tesla announced that it had reached Musk's goal of manufacturing 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week.

Federal prosecutors on Tuesday publicly debunked conspiracy theories pushed by President Donald Trump and right-wing media that a former Democratic aide charged with bank fraud was actually a foreign spy trying to steal government secrets. In a plea deal with Imran Awan, who worked as an information technology aide for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., and other Democratic lawmakers, prosecutors said they had conducted "a thorough investigation" into claims that Awan stole information from government servers on behalf of another country while working for House Democrats, but reported that they found no evidence to support the conspiracy theories. "The Government agrees that the public allegations that (Awan) stole U.S. House of Representatives equipment and engaged in unauthorized or illegal conduct involving House computer systems do not form the basis of any conduct relevant to the determination of the sentence in this case," prosecutors said.

But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.

Even Pruitt’s own staff had begun to sour on him, with many worrying that their future career prospects would be damaged by their association with Pruitt’s tenure. Each scandal seemed more damning than the last. Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.

The Labor Department report, due at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to show nonfarm payrolls increased by 195,000 jobs last month, while average hourly earnings are expected to rise 0.3 percent. Just before the tariff deadline, President Donald Trump upped the ante, warning that the United States may ultimately target over $500 billion worth of Chinese goods, or roughly the total amount of U.S. imports from China last year.
Bishop John Bauerschmidt, who oversees the Middle Tennessee region of the church, stands firmly by his decision not to authorize their use, nor allow clergy within his diocese to officiate the religious ceremonies or permit the weddings on church property.

While Bishops can place limitations on the use of the marriage liturgies, they must refer couples to a willing diocese if they do not authorize them.

Trump’s chaos theory of running companies is now on full display in the West Wing, but it’s also on display in the rest of us. He’s the made himself the center of our universe, and most of us are now unwittingly circling his orbit. It’s time for every Trump critic in cyberspace to pause, take a deep breath (or five) and put the salesman-turned-president in proper perspective. The founders wanted a government of the people, but they never said we had to tweet at the president’s level. He’s merely today’s shiniest, (though ever-fading) object and in reality represents nothing new.
There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void. In New Jersey, this is compounded by the fact that the state is located between two big cities, New York and Philadelphia, that are in other states. The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.
Bishop John Bauerschmidt, who oversees the Middle Tennessee region of the church, stands firmly by his decision not to authorize their use, nor allow clergy within his diocese to officiate the religious ceremonies or permit the weddings on church property. In doing so, the bishop says he is being faithful to his job of guarding the discipline, faith and unity of the church.

"The teaching that Christian marriage is between a man and a woman is reasonable, traditional, and scriptural," Bauerschmidt said in an email. "There really is nothing remarkable about a Christian bishop who holds to this teaching." While Bishops can place limitations on the use of the marriage liturgies, they must refer couples to a willing diocese if they do not authorize them.
Delivering a speech in Newcastle on Thursday, he said: “At the moment, protectionism is largely just talk (and tweets). But what if rhetoric becomes reality?”
Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.
The U.S. trade deficit dropped in May to the lowest level in 19 months as U.S. exports rose to a record level. But the trade gap between the United States and China increased sharply, underscoring the economic tensions between the world's two biggest economies. The Commerce Department says the May trade deficit — the difference between what America sells and what it buys in foreign markets — fell 6.6 percent to $43.1 billion. It was the smallest imbalance since October 2016. Exports climbed 1.9 percent to a record $215.3 billion.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Almost 17,000 members of the armed forces have been promoted
Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has promoted 16,900 soldiers as a reward for their "loyalty". The promotion comes amid a worsening economic and political crisis during which opposition politicians have called on the armed forces to side "with the people". Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino said those promoted had been "loyal to the constitutionally elected president". He also praised them "for respecting human rights". The promotion comes just 10 days after the UN human rights body released a report saying that Venezuelan security forces had carried out hundreds of arbitrary killings.
The president told Fox News that he believes his nominee will get some support from Democrats. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, an abortion rights supporter, is considered one of the key votes on a nominee. She said she wouldn't vote for someone who would overturn Roe v. Wade. "A candidate who would overturn Roe would not be acceptable," she said Sunday on ABC's This Week. Collins, who has previously bucked party lines on other key issues such as health care, said she plans to have an in-depth conversation with the nominee.
A "permanent" cease-fire the rivals agreed on last week was violated within hours on Saturday, with each side blaming the other. They have not yet agreed on any power-sharing deal. South Sudan's civil war has killed tens of thousands and created Africa's largest refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Millions are near famine and aid delivery is often blocked in one of the world's most dangerous countries for humanitarian workers. Both sides have been accused of abuses including gang-rapes, sometimes along ethnic lines.

That came on the heels of 0.9 percent drop in March, the first monthly drop since July of 2017. Total private construction rose 0.3 percent, with residential projects up 0.8 percent in May. New single-family home construction rose 0.6 percent and the volatile apartment building sector jumped 1.6 percent. Private, non-residential building fell 0.3 percent. Economists are forecasting that construction spending will contribute to overall growth this year even though interest rates are rising.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services sector activity picked up in June amid strong growth in new orders, but trade tariffs and a shortage of workers were starting to strain the supply chain, which could slow momentum in the coming months.

While other data on Thursday showed private payrolls rising less than expected last month and a surprise increase in new applications for unemployment benefits last week, overall labor market conditions continue to tighten. The labor market is considered to be near or at full employment, with the jobless rate at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent. The unemployment rate has dropped by three-tenths of a percentage point this year and is near the Federal Reserve’s forecast of 3.6 percent by the end of this year.
The vast majority of swing voters across the United States oppose the Democrats’ latest plan to abolish all immigration enforcement by ending the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. In recent weeks, Democrats in the House and Senate, along with progressive liberals like Cynthia Nixon in New York and most recently insurgent Democrat candidate for Congress, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have been demanding ICE be abolished and all immigration enforcement be ended. House Democrats are now crafting legislation that would officially abolish ICE. The latest Harvard/Harris Poll, though, reveals that swing voters are overwhelmingly opposed to the Democrats’ plan to end all immigration enforcement across the U.S.
Nearly 3-in-4 swing voters, about 73 percent, of swing voters said they do not want ICE to be disbanded. Less than 30 percent of swing voters said they support the abolishment of ICE.

The government will appoint a national LGBT health adviser and take measures to end so-called conversion therapy as part of a plan to deliver what Theresa May has promised will be “real and lasting change”. The proposals form part of an action plan published by the Equalities Office on Tuesday. It follows a UK-wide survey of LGBT people that had more than 108,000 responses, billed as the largest study of its kind. The 30-page plan contains a series of pledges, including to improve the police response to LGBT hate incidents, more support for LGBT students and teachers and improvements to gender identity services for transgender adults. The proposals, which will receive an initial £4.5m in funding, were welcomed by the campaign groups Stonewall and the LGBT Foundation.
Corporate America couldn’t hire Republican lobbyists fast enough after President Donald Trump’s election gave the GOP unified control of Washington. Now there are signs that Democrats are back in demand. Companies and trade groups are trying to hire congressional staffers with ties to influential House Democrats four months ahead of the midterm elections, in which Democrats are expected to pick up seats and potentially retake control of the House. Lobbyists are helping their clients meet with the Democrats who would become committee chairs if the party does win back the chamber. And trade groups are talking to members about what to expect from a Democratic takeover.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
BREAKING: @NEAToday President @Lily_NEA reacts to radical ruling by #SCOTUS: "We are living in a system that is rigged to benefit special interests & billionaires, all at the expense of working people."

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.
The strategy reprises last year's successful approach to confirming Justice Neil Gorsuch in the early spring of 2017. Gorsuch was named to fill the vacancy left by the death of Antonin Scalia and then kept open by the refusal of the Senate's Republican majority to consider Merrick Garland, the replacement named by President Barack Obama in 2016. Gorsuch was greeted with delight by abortion opponents, even though he had not ruled directly on Roe in his judicial career. But his confirmation was far from a sure thing because two Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, were seen as defenders of abortion rights.

In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners. Alas, he is wasting his time trying to shift the views of the Democratic Party, which has become ever more left-wing, if not outright socialist. I think it is time for Mr. James to become a Republican. Guy Randolph

It’s shocking that Mr. James is surprised by the positive economic results of less regulation and lower taxes.
Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
It was President Obama who left his party in this position. His anti-business agenda was unpopular, but was never revisited. Democrats’ losses over the past decade stemmed in large part from a slow-growth economy that never gained momentum. Even though he received what he called a “shellacking” in the 2010 midterms, and even though the GOP made unprecedented political gains during his tenure, President Obama was always convinced the country was behind him. As Mara Liasson wrote for NPR in 2016: “During Obama's eight years in office, the Democrats have lost more House, Senate, state legislative and governors seats than under any other president.” She noted that the Obama legacy includes “one huge failure: a diminished Democratic Party.”
In 2013, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., invoked the so-called “nuclear option,” discarding traditional filibuster protections for the minority party in favor of requiring only a simple majority to approve judicial and executive branch nominees.

“Regardless of political parties, we need people to make a decision about what’s happening in the classroom,” said Marisol Garcia, vice president of the Arizona Education Association. “To limit ourselves and to say ‘only these people are going to support us’ is just not true.”
Teachers can be at a disadvantage compared to wealthier candidates, who tend to have built-in networks of potential donors. The NEA’s Eskelsen Garcia experienced that firsthand when she ran for Congress in Utah in 1998, recalling mystified looks and wary questions from people trying to figure out who was bankrolling her (she lost to the Republican nominee in the general election). But teachers, especially experienced ones, can benefit from their network of former students and their real-life connection to middle-class voters. “As a teacher married to a teacher, I know what it’s like to work paycheck to paycheck,” said Tom Niermann, a teacher running to unseat Rep. Kevin Yoder (R-Kan.) in suburban Kansas City.
Kinner was being held without bail at the Ada County jail on 15 charges, including six of injury to a child and nine of aggravated battery, jail records showed. There was no lawyer listed for Kinner in the records. Kinner may have wanted to “extract vengeance” for being kicked out by a tenant who took him in, Police Chief Bill Bones said at a press conference on Sunday. The woman who took Kinner in was not harmed and was not at the residence at the time of the attack. Kinner assaulted the children at the party after he was unable to find the woman, police said, adding his motive was still under investigation.

Ethiopia's government has fired five prison officials as it confronts allegations of torture and other abuses of inmates as part of a wave of reforms. Among those fired is the federal prison chief who until recently defended the treatment of inmates as "fair." The firings came ahead of a new Human Rights Watch report released Thursday that documents widespread arbitrary detention, torture, rape and humiliation over several years in Ethiopia's eastern Somali region. It urges new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to investigate the "horrific" situation. Abiy has admitted that security forces have tortured people but has yet to "tackle Ethiopia's culture of impunity and ensure accountability," said Felix Horne, senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch.
But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said. Tackett said he's concerned about children, especially in Eastern Kentucky, which has a higher rate of Medicaid patients and some of the state's worst oral health. "I have no problem with them regulating the adults that are on Medicaid," Tackett said. "If they are young and healthy, they should be out working or doing something.

Three of the teens were named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit.

Each scandal seemed more damning than the last. Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.

Avenatti's former law firm, Eagan Avenatti LLP, agreed to make the roughly $452,000 tax payment last month in order to resolve a bankruptcy case, but the funds never arrived at the IRS, according to a filing Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, Calif.

Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) trashed the June jobs report — even though it showed rapid job growth, rising wages, and low unemployment. The report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that employers created 213,000 new jobs in June — 22,000 more than economists had expected. Manufacturing jobs in particular rose by 36,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.

The report also said that Strzok repeatedly pushed for more aggressive action in the Clinton probe. "The conduct by these employees cast a cloud over the entire FBI investigation and sowed doubt about the FBI’s work," the report concluded. "The damage caused by these employees’ actions extends far beyond the scope of the (Clinton) investigation and goes to the heart of the FBI’s reputation for neutral fact finding and political independence." Goelman, in an op-ed in USA TODAY last month, said Strzok has become the victim of "political gamesmanship" by Congress and President Trump, who has repeatedly tweeted about Strzok as evidence of bias by the FBI and Justice Department. "They have spent months cynically taking these texts out of context and saying that one- or two-word snippets somehow prove that the FBI investigations of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the Russia probe itself, were biased," Goelman wrote.
Yet those people were served. And since it is in Virginia, was Sanders even the first member of the Trump administration to eat there? Maybe others less recognizable had already come and gone.

3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.

What more was I supposed to do?” she asked. The Mail cites research published this week by the Royal College of Physicians, which suggests that Britain is training only half the number of doctors the country will require by 2030 — with the NHS increasingly turning to foreign doctors to plug the gaps. Fully 108,000 of 289,000 doctors currently on the medical register qualified overseas, around tw0-thirds of whom qualified outside the European Union — including 25,000 from India, 12,000 from Pakistan, and 5,000 from Nigeria. While most of these foreign doctors are perfectly capable, a disproportionate number turn out to be incompetent, with more than half of doctors subject to ‘fitness to practice’ investigation by the General Medical Council (GMC) being non-British. Critics suggest that plundering the Third World of clinicians rather than training British talent will disincentivise poor countries from investing in medical training, as the investment is a waste of limited resources if doctors simply leave for Western countries once qualified.

Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) trashed the June jobs report — even though it showed rapid job growth, rising wages, and low unemployment. The report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that employers created 213,000 new jobs in June — 22,000 more than economists had expected. Manufacturing jobs in particular rose by 36,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.
'We’re going to run different'
His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
In the four days since he was elected, he has repeatedly said he didn't want bodyguards and that "the people will protect me." He has also said the crowd of press also serves to protect him, but complained half-jokingly about the crush of journalists that accompany him everywhere — even interviewing him from motorcycles that shadow his car's every move. He said Thursday: "I would like a little, just a little bit, of privacy."
But Britain's biggest business lobby group, the Confederation of British Industry, welcomed Friday's announcement as a "good starting point." "This is a genuine confidence boost and the prime minister deserves credit for delivering a unified approach" said Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director general, in a statement. Yet elements of the plan are likely to be unacceptable to the European Union. The world's biggest trading bloc only grants unfettered market access to countries where all its citizens have the right to live and work. May wants to end this freedom of movement, replacing it with a vague "mobility framework."
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) tweeted a still more vague yet somehow more expansive vision Tuesday, calling for “restructuring the agencies that enforce our immigration laws, including ICE.”

A judge ordered federal emergency officials to extend vouchers for temporary hotel housing for nearly 1,700 Puerto Rican hurricane evacuees, saying ending the program could cause irreparable harm. Saturday night's decision came shortly after civil rights group LatinoJustice PRLDEF filed a lawsuit seeking relief for the Puerto Ricans, whose federal housing assistance vouchers were set to expire at midnight Sunday, meaning the evacuees could have been evicted from the hotels. The order says the agency cannot end its Transitional Sheltering Assistance program until at least midnight on Tuesday. The organization is pushing to let families stay another six months. U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin of Massachusetts wrote that ending the program would drain other public resources.
Mazzochi, an attorney, already has name recognition in DuPage County, he said, because of her experience on the College of DuPage Board. She was elected to that board in April 2015 and has been chairman or acting chairman since December 2015, which was a tumultuous time for the college. She will face Democrat James M. “Jim” Caffrey in the November election to represent the 47th district. Bellock said she was not looking for a full-time job after she retired from the Illinois House, but the governor and his team asked her to head the health care and family services department. “I look at this as a real honor,” Bellock said.
Calls for an Iran without its current “dictatorial regime” were met with strengthened hope during the annual “free Iran” rally held in Paris this past weekend by the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), an exiled Paris-based Iranian opposition group allied with the Mujaheddin-e-Khalq (MEK). The rally, which event organizers said saw more than 100,000 attendees, took place at the Villepinte Congress Center, outside of Paris on Saturday. A series of panel discussions ranging in topic from women’s rights to denuclearization took place on Friday. The Guardian reported there was “a crowd of about 4,000, many of them refugees and young eastern Europeans who had been bussed in to attend the rally in return for a weekend trip to Paris.”
Distinguished speakers at Saturday’s event included former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal attorney; New Mexico’s former Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson; former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich; former Sen. Robert Torricelli (D-NJ); former FBI Director Louis Freeh; former Homeland Security Adviser Frances Townsend; and former U.S. Army chief of staff Gen. George Casey.
In a statement, Cleveland police said it is "not our policy to discuss tactics or personnel resources" regarding whether they would be increasing security Wednesday. The statement concluded with “We continue to rely on the public to be our extra set of eyes and ears, to be vigilant, and when they "see something, say something." In Washington, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday that "President Trump commends the work of the DOJ and the FBI in helping stop this would-be attacker."

Fox News again dominated for the second quarter of 2018 not only in cable news, but in all of cable, while CNN landed in last place by a country mile. For the eighth straight quarter, Fox was the most-watched network in all of cable. With an average of 1.409 million total day viewers, Fox attracted nearly as many eyeballs as MSNBC and CNN combined. MSNBC averaged just 930,000 viewers, while CNN nosedived with an average of just 658,000. During primetime, Fox snagged an average of 2.447 million viewers, compared to MSNBC’s 1.736 million.

"We have made tremendous progress and the future of the EPA is very bright!" In his resignation letter to Trump, Pruitt said: "It is extremely difficult for me to cease serving you in this role first because I count it a blessing to be serving you in any capacity, but also, because of the transformative work that is occurring. "However, the unrelenting attacks on me personally [and] my family, are unprecedented and have taken a sizable toll on all of us," Pruitt added. Pruitt resigned less than a week after The New York Times reported that the EPA's chief ethics official, Kevin Minoli, had been pushing for a series of independent investigation into several aspects of Pruitt's tenure. Those include Pruitt's rental of a Washington D.C. condominium for $50 per day from the spouse of a prominent fossil fuel lobbyist and his alleged use of staff to handle personal matters.
“Yes, it was,” he replied. However, Howden rejected the suggestion he had “created a situation” for such gross abuse to occur with posters stating “every salesman for themselves”.

Nebraska May Join Utah, Idaho in Putting Medicaid Expansion Before Voters
Enlarge this image toggle caption Fred Knapp/NET News Fred Knapp/NET News
Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.

The nonpartisan Cook Political Report says Democrats are "likely" to carry Montana in the Senate race. Inside Elections rates the contest as one that "tilts Democratic." After the rally, the spokesman for Tester's re-election campaign put out a statement that was critical of Rosendale but which did not mention the president. "Jon's record is clear—if it's good for Montana, Jon works with anyone from either party to get things done. If it's bad for Montana, he'll stand up to anyone," Tester spokesman Chris Meagher said.
The president told Fox News that he believes his nominee will get some support from Democrats. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, an abortion rights supporter, is considered one of the key votes on a nominee. She said she wouldn't vote for someone who would overturn Roe v. Wade. "A candidate who would overturn Roe would not be acceptable," she said Sunday on ABC's This Week. Collins, who has previously bucked party lines on other key issues such as health care, said she plans to have an in-depth conversation with the nominee.
He said contracts obtained under energy reforms passed under President Enrique Pena Nieto will be scrutinized for any corruption or illegality, but otherwise contracts will be honored.

PORTLAND, Ore. -- Two opposing protest groups -- Patriot Prayer and antifa -- clashed in downtown Portland Saturday, CBS Portland affiliate KOIN reports. Portland police said failure to leave the area could leave to arrests, calling the demonstration a riot. More than 100 members of Patriot Prayer group gathered at Terry Schrunk Plaza for a "freedom rally," while more than 100 counter protesters with an antifa group gathered across the street at Chapman Square for rallies before a march. Police revoked Patriot Prayer's permit for the rally after the two groups began to clash. People were lighting firecrackers and smoke bombs in the crowd while police used flash bangs in an effort to disperse the clashing protesters.

On the Fourth of July, 1852, America celebrated its freedom, as it does every Independence Day. Frederick Douglass, America’s most famous anti-slavery activist and fugitive slave, saw no ground to celebrate: he saw the octopus arms of slavery stretched everywhere, exposing the hollowness of America’s freedom values. That holiday, he delivered the greatest antislavery speech in American history. Not least since the racism that made slavery endures.
Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
It's difficult to imagine Old Hickory, as he was known, excusing himself from military duty on the grounds that he could not march long distances, as Mr Trump did during the Vietnam War, citing bone spurs. The parallels between the 45th president and the 13th - unlucky for some - are arguably more compelling. Fillmore launched his career in the 1820s with the Anti-Masonic Party, hawking a paranoid rumour that ruling Freemasons were murdering whistleblowers. Mr Trump paved the way for his White House bid by peddling a conspiracy theory, too - that President Barack Obama was not a US citizen.

Fillmore later joined the Whig Party at a time of mounting hostility to refugees from famine, rebellion and tyranny who were arriving by the shipload at the gates of the New World.
And that's really been the case all along. He's publicly supported Pruitt through all of this. And for Pruitt's part, you know, he was pretty unapologetic in his resignation letter. He has and continues to blame all of this, you know, perceived brouhaha on environmentalists and the media, people who were upset about the work that he's doing at EPA.

Police have cordoned off at least five areas, including a park, a church and a pharmacy, where the couple had been before they became sick. Officials said people who had been in the areas around where the pair had been before collapsing should wash their clothes, although they insisted risk of contamination was minimal.

The use of robots to commune with people with Alzheimer’s opens up a whole box of moral quandaries, not least the prospect of some cognitive threshold beneath which patients will be pushed into the arms of machines, rather than humans. It is worth remembering too that like the digital “assistants” now entering people’s homes, Pepper and the current robo-carers do not offer anything approaching the nuances and complexities of genuine human interchange, rather an app store version that most people would consider a matter of erratic entertainment rather than a day-do-day necessity. But as and when robots manage to convincingly perform as make-believe humans, what then? Paradoxically, key voices in the tech world have long believed that as automation sweeps through large swathes of the economy, with the right fiscal adjustments, it will increase the numbers of human caregivers, and elevate them above the low-paid parts of the labour market where such roles are currently concentrated. Last year, for example, a writer in Wired magazine said that such roles as “companions to the elderly, home health aides, babysitters, special-needs aides, and more” demanded to be taken more seriously, and that “the riches resulting from increased automation … could be used to help fund caregiving programs”.

Research has consistently shown that Trump won because of racial resentment among white voters. Chris Hayes (@chrislhayes) The modern GOP is basically Steve Bannon, Steve King and Stephen Miller on one side engaged in a project to preserve and enshrine dominance for its ethnic/racial base, and Paul Ryan and John Roberts on the other who pretend they have no idea what they’re up to. While that strategy has worked in the short-term, some Republicans recognize that it can’t work in the long-term, and they’re fighting to save their party from extinction. Can a carbon tax save the GOP? Climate change is one of many issues that divides the Republican Party.

That came on the heels of 0.9 percent drop in March, the first monthly drop since July of 2017. Total private construction rose 0.3 percent, with residential projects up 0.8 percent in May. New single-family home construction rose 0.6 percent and the volatile apartment building sector jumped 1.6 percent. Private, non-residential building fell 0.3 percent. Economists are forecasting that construction spending will contribute to overall growth this year even though interest rates are rising.
For new vehicles, that means an average of about 30 miles per gallon instead of rising to 36 mpg by 2025 as Obama's EPA proposed. — OIL AND GAS: More than a dozen states are suing the EPA for failing to take action against leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, from oil and natural gas wells. Last year, a federal appeals court ruled that Pruitt overstepped his authority in trying to stall an Obama-era rule requiring companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks. — AGRICULTURE: In March 2017, a month after becoming EPA administrator, Pruitt delayed consideration of banning usage of a widely used pesticide, chlorpyrifos, on food crops for at least five years. The pesticide has been banned for household use since 2001, but agriculture groups want to keep using it.
There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void. In New Jersey, this is compounded by the fact that the state is located between two big cities, New York and Philadelphia, that are in other states. The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.
No one was ever arrested for the blaze, although Fieseler writes about how investigators keyed into one main suspect in the fire — a disgruntled bar patron who'd been kicked out earlier in the day and had been heard threatening to burn the place down. It wasn't until 2003 that a plaque commemorating the fire's victims was laid. New Orleans was a conflicted place for the gay community at the time of the fire, Fieseler says. In some ways, the city was a haven for the gay community where people could be themselves. But there were also raids on gay bars, harassment, and discrimination: "An individual who was quiet and who was closeted gay, could find companionship, could find love and joy, could have a job, could have a house, so long as this individual never spoke the dreaded H.

It's been weeks since President Trump declared talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a great success. But today, the Washington Post is reporting that U.S. intelligence officials have concluded North Korea does not intend to fully surrender its nuclear stockpile. We thought this would be a good moment to check in with someone who spent decades working on arms reduction and denuclearization treaties.

“We will not hesitate to take action when we see sanctionable activity and that is consistent with our policy of economic and diplomatic isolation against Iran,” Brian Hook told reporters at a State Department briefing. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images Trump administration on Iran sanctions: 'We will not hesitate' to punish offenders
The Trump administration "will not hesitate” to punish foreign companies that don't comply with sanctions set to be reimposed on Iran in the coming months, a senior State Department official said Monday. The proclamation — and looming penalties — could further escalate tensions with America's longtime allies in Europe that have expressed a desire to continue doing business with Iran. Story Continued Below
Officials from the Treasury Department and State Department have spent the past several weeks meeting with their counterparts around the globe, including in Europe, State Department Director of Policy Planning Brian Hook said, ahead of the reimposition of sanctions in early August. “We will not hesitate to take action when we see sanctionable activity and that is consistent with our policy of economic and diplomatic isolation against Iran,” Hook told reporters at a State Department briefing, before describing the traveling "road shows" U.S. officials are conducting to explain the policy.
About four years ago, Dais had lined up a Chinese company to help develop its business in nanotechnology that helps produce clean water. Tangredi said the Chinese company persuaded a long-time Dais employee to defect with trade secrets. "They just stole it, and they are using it against us," he said. Tangredi said he hopes the threat of a trade war will force China to rethink its practices: "You've got to do something to get their attention."

While the US tariffs aim to cut down the trade deficit, there are worries about how China's retaliatory tariffs will hit the US economy. The US Chamber of Commerce says some states will have billions of dollars worth of exports at risk. States such as Louisiana export about $5.7bn of goods to China. Several southern states, many of which also backed Trump in the election, also risk being hit.

As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.

STAT OF THE DAY, via WaPo’s Abigail Hauslohner and Andrew Ba Tran: “The number of people receiving visas to move permanently to the United States is on pace to drop 12 percent in President Trump’s first two years in office, according to a Washington Post analysis of State Department data. “Among the most affected are the Muslim-majority countries on the president’s travel ban list -- Yemen, Syria, Iran, Libya and Somalia -- where the number of new arrivals to the United States is heading toward an 81 percent drop by Sept. 30, the end of the second fiscal year under Trump.” https://wapo.st/2tODvE0

While not as eye-catching as, for example, his demand that his official vehicle use sirens so he could reach a French restaurant on time, Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left behind a demoralized agency where staff fret that their ability to protect public health has been diminished. A staunch ally of oil and gas companies, Pruitt stacked EPA advisory boards with industry representatives and sought to set aside whole troves of research that link pollution to various illnesses. He oversaw the delay or destruction of dozens of clean air and water rules, sparking legal battles with states and environmental groups. The EPA’s record in court under Pruitt was patchy but his deregulatory zeal was enough to impress Trump, who said Pruitt was doing a “fantastic job” even as scandals that sparked more than a dozen different investigations swirled around him. Pruitt became a trusted advisor to Trump, helping convince the president the US should withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.
The services sector, where most Americans are employed, has now expanded for 101 consecutive months, or more than eight years. The gain was better than many economists had been expecting and depicts an overall economy that appears to be regaining momentum after a slowdown in the winter.
Hope Life Center in western Illinois provides unplanned pregnancy counseling and ultrasounds for about five to 10 women a week, with a mission to “erase abortion from Illinois one woman and one child at time,” according to its website. So Executive Director Debbie Case was alarmed by a change last year in the state's so-called right-of-conscience law, requiring health care providers to inform pregnant patients of all available medical options, including abortion. She said the pregnancy center even shut down for part of 2017 because its physician feared potential repercussions of violating the law, which is now temporarily blocked by the courts. Case and other anti-abortion advocates across the state hailed Tuesday’s ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court against a similar law in California on First Amendment grounds, hoping the decision will strengthen their legal battle in Illinois. “We’re definitely encouraged,” said Case, whose center is in Sterling, about two hours west of Chicago.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
On this much police and activist South Side priest Michael Pfleger can agree: Saturday morning’s anti-violence march on the Dan Ryan Expressway is all about danger. Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.
Starting with his own community, Crowley said he aims to "do more" so others will see education as the first "stoplight" before young boys and girls become more incarcerated criminals. "By doing more, I came to the decision of running for state Senate," he said. "We’ve seen it on Tuesday — people really want to see something done in their community." But Crowley’s most challenging hurdle is a stark reality for all Democrats this cycle: falling voter turnout. A new Pew Research study found that while the youngest generations, including Generation X, Millennials, and the post-Millennial generation, make up of the bulk of eligible voters in 2018, if turnout outcomes from the 2014 midterms persist, they are less inclined to comprise of the majority of voters who cast ballots this November.
The services sector, where most Americans are employed, has now expanded for 101 consecutive months, or more than eight years. The gain was better than many economists had been expecting and depicts an overall economy that appears to be regaining momentum after a slowdown in the winter.
In one case, Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion that illegal immigrants do not have the same bargaining rights as American citizens and legal workers. “… an illegal immigrant worker is not an ’employee’ under the NLRA for the simple reason that, ever since 1986, an illegal immigrant worker is not a lawful ’employee’ in the United States,” Kavanaugh wrote. In another case, Kavanaugh noted that American multi-national corporations do not have the right to import foreign workers. The Circuit judge explained, “Under the provision of the immigration laws at issue here, mere economic expediency does not authorize an employer to displace American workers for foreign workers.”
Prominent conservative Ann Coulter has also called for Trump to nominate Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, arguing that other judges such as Thomas Hardiman and Raymond Kethledge “are open borders zealots.”

But even those sympathetic to the biggest retailer in the US are questioning whether there has been more take than give. Amazon has long been accused of stretching the city’s transit and education systems, and its highly paid workers have driven up prices of goods and housing. The resentful murmur recently became a roar after Amazon reacted to the city’s latest tax proposal, which would have charged large businesses an annual $275 per employee, by resorting to what critics call blackmail.
The latest high-level departure from President Donald Trump's Cabinet was not the most unexpected departure that has faced the administration. Scott Pruitt, the administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency, came under fire multiple times during his tenure over questionable finances, including both excessive spending and sweetheart deals that helped him spend less than expected. Here's a review of his time in office. Dec. 7, 2016: Trump announces that Pruitt will be his nominee for EPA administrator
The then-Attorney General of Oklahoma was touted by Trump as having "great qualifications and a good record." Part of that record was Pruitt touting himself as a "leading advocate against the EPA's activist agenda," and his history of challenging the EPA was well known.

Pruitt's confirmation, which was approved with a vote of 52-46, came in the midst of a court order that required him to turn over thousands of communications with major coal, oil and gas companies from his time in office. Democratic senators expressed outrage that Republicans were going ahead as scheduled with the vote on Pruitt, despite the judge’s ruling in the order. March 23, 2017: Defends budget cuts to his agency
The budget plan put forward by the Trump administration proposed cuts 31 percent of the EPA’s funding, including significant reductions to research programs and enforcement of clean air and clean water programs, but that didn’t bother Pruitt.

“However, many District contacts expressed concern about the possible adverse effects of tariffs and other proposed trade restrictions, both domestically and abroad, on future investment activity; contacts in some Districts indicated that plans for capital spending had been scaled back or postponed as a result of uncertainty over trade policy.”

Conditions in the agricultural sector reportedly improved somewhat, but contacts were concerned about the effect of potentially higher tariffs on their exports.”
These reports are from the economy’s ground floor, not the Beltway penthouse. They show that U.S. tariffs and the risks of retaliation are creating uncertainty that could reduce business investment. This probably won’t show up in GDP for the recently completed second quarter because the tariff impact is only starting to be felt.

Officials said people who had been in the areas around where the pair had been before collapsing should wash their clothes, although they insisted risk of contamination was minimal. The pair is now being treated in the same hospital where Skripal and his daughter spent weeks in critical condition following the attack, which London blamed on Moscow. Russia vehemently denied the accusations, insisting it doesn’t have any nerve agents. And Moscow even went as far as to blame Britain for the attack, saying it was part of a larger effort to foster anti-Russian sentiment. The exposure will inevitably raise fresh questions about the insistence by authorities that there was no broader risk to the public from the March attack.
It was very much a celebration of the creation of a system that offered universal healthcare based on clinical need rather than ability to pay. But the 70th anniversary has not stopped awkward questions about the NHS's performance. The BBC's Nick Robinson hopes that the 70th anniversary will be marked by "a healthier national conversation focused on how to help those who care for us, and help more people live longer, healthier lives." He wroted: "The gift the health service needs is an open, honest, clear-headed diagnosis of its strengths and, yes, its weaknesses, too. That and a national conversation."
Rep. Jim Jordan Denies He Knew Of Decades-Long Sexual Abuse At Ohio State

Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, one of the most powerful conservatives in Congress, has denied reports that he ignored the alleged sexual abuse of athletes while he worked as an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University more than 20 years ago. Allegations that Jordan was aware of sexual misconduct and explicitly was informed of specific incidents of alleged assault by the wrestling team's doctor, first surfaced in an NBC news story on Tuesday. But Jordan — who was an assistant coach from 1987 until 1995, when he was elected to the state legislature — has refuted the claims. "Congressman Jordan never saw any abuse, never heard about any abuse, and never had any abuse reported to him during his time as a coach at Ohio State," Ian Fury, Jordan's spokesman, said in a statement. "He has not been contacted by investigators about the matter but will assist them in any way they ask, because if what is alleged is true, the victims deserve a full investigation and justice."
This was particularly an issue for Pruitt’s former executive scheduler Sydney Hupp, who often had to shell out for Pruitt’s trips. Hupp was also asked by Pruitt to speak with staff at one of Trump’s hotels, believing he could get a deal on a second-hand mattress they were selling. Pruitt remained miserly even when he was abusing his position to get a good deal. He fell behind on the rental payments on the condo he was getting on the cheap and eventually had to be evicted and the locks were changed.

As the Italian hierarchy aligns itself ever more closely with the open-borders movement, the country’s citizens — most of whom are Catholic — seem to be moving in the opposite direction, creating a curious lay-clerical split. Italy’s interior minister, Matteo Salvini, is now the most trusted politician in the country by a significant margin, a position he has earned above all by his firm stance against unchecked mass migration. Yet when Salvini refused debarkation rights in late June to the NGO vessel Aquarius that was carrying hundreds of African migrants, the Italian bishops were among those protesting most loudly. “It is Jesus coming to us on a vessel, he is in the man or child who drowns, it is Jesus who fishes through the garbage in search of a little food,” said Cardinal Francesco Montenegro, archbishop of Agrigento, in his July 1 homily. “Immigrants, the poor, are a thermometer for our faith,” he continued.

Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
Abbott said on Tuesday night he never conceived of climate change as a moral challenge. “It was an issue, that’s all, and – at least on the actual changes we’ve so far seen – not a very significant one compared to man’s inhumanity to man; maintaining and improving living standards; and even to many other environmental issues such as degraded bush and waterways, particulate pollution, water quality in the third world, deforestation and urban overcrowding.”
He contended that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide from roughly 300 to 400 parts per million over the last century had not triggered “dramatic consequences”. Play Video 0:32 Andrew Probyn calls Tony Abbott 'destructive' in ABC report – video

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

Durbin’s advocacy for mass-migration and for younger ‘dreamer’ illegals has caused the Democrats much political pain. He pushed for the abortive budget-shutdown in January 2018, and for the “Gang of Eight” amnesty bill in 2013 which helped the Democrats lose nine seats in 2014. The Democrats’ top leader in the Senate, Sen. Chuck Schumer, is keeping his distance from the “Abolish ICE” campaign. He is instead using his Twitter account to tout Democrats’ promises on healthcare, guns, gay status, and claims that President Donald Trump is tied to Russian President Vladimir Putin. On the Abolish ICE campaign, Schumer is instead calling for a “czar” to focus media attention on “reunifying families.” That topic polls better for Democrats than ending immigration enforcement.

Teaching kids to recognize what is average teen stress and what is not is how Naperville area youth organizations are responding to a survey conducted last year. The cause of youth stress in Naperville was the focus of a 2018 State of the Kids report released in January and based on the results of an October 2017 survey done with seventh-graders and 10th-graders in Naperville School District 203 and Indian Prairie School District 204. The report gave a snapshot of the top stressors affecting kids, what factors contribute to daily stress and how the community might help kids manage or prevent the stress they’re experiencing. Seven of 10 seventh-graders and nearly eight in 10 sophomores say they experience moderate or high levels of daily stress. About half of both groups say the stress makes it difficult to perform daily tasks because they feel overwhelmed by anxiety, lack focus and struggle to concentrate.
Earlier this year, former Planned Parenthood facility director-turned pro-life activist Abby Johnson observed to Breitbart News the gradual transformation of Planned Parenthood into a political movement during the tenure of former CEO Cecile Richards. Johnson said Richards left “a trail of misery in her wake – over 2.5 million babies aborted on her watch, a decrease of 51% in breast cancer screenings, a grand total of zero mammograms, a drop of 65% in pap smears, and an organization that has eschewed healthcare in favor of building a political movement by serving 670,540 less patients since 2006.”

Much like them, Crowley said he believes there is an awakening happening in the country. "The last election — the presidential election as well as this election coming forward — a lot of people awakened," he said. "It’s looking pretty good," he affirmed. "I’m young, black and a Democrat. I want to be viewed different so we’re going to run different."
Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
This was particularly an issue for Pruitt’s former executive scheduler Sydney Hupp, who often had to shell out for Pruitt’s trips. Hupp was also asked by Pruitt to speak with staff at one of Trump’s hotels, believing he could get a deal on a second-hand mattress they were selling. Pruitt remained miserly even when he was abusing his position to get a good deal. He fell behind on the rental payments on the condo he was getting on the cheap and eventually had to be evicted and the locks were changed.
No one was ever arrested for the blaze, although Fieseler writes about how investigators keyed into one main suspect in the fire — a disgruntled bar patron who'd been kicked out earlier in the day and had been heard threatening to burn the place down. It wasn't until 2003 that a plaque commemorating the fire's victims was laid. New Orleans was a conflicted place for the gay community at the time of the fire, Fieseler says. In some ways, the city was a haven for the gay community where people could be themselves. But there were also raids on gay bars, harassment, and discrimination: "An individual who was quiet and who was closeted gay, could find companionship, could find love and joy, could have a job, could have a house, so long as this individual never spoke the dreaded H.

Tory differences over UK's post-Brexit future spill into the open Read more
The Labour leader has said the result of the 2016 vote should be respected, but his frontbenchers have been careful not to explicitly rule out a second referendum if the circumstances change. Earlier in the day, Len McCluskey, Unite’s general secretary, said May’s government had lost all authority or capacity to make decisions. “We are not, I repeat for my friends in the media, not, calling for a second referendum … But we remain open to the possibility of a vote on any deal the Tories come back with,” he said. “These people see in Brexit the chance to turn Britain into the low-wage, deregulated, race-to-the-bottom society of their dreams. But Brexit is turning into a nightmare for the rest of us – a nightmare of uncertainty above all.

Our Founding Fathers resolved that without freedom Americans could not enjoy life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. To secure it, they fought a war to break free from the bonds of tyranny. It isn’t a faraway tyrant that oppresses us today. Rather, we are in the grip of a new kind of tyranny — that of mistrust. This tyrant sits on a throne in our minds and is just as cruel as King George was during the time of the Founders.
I noticed the upside-down portrait of Hamilton several years ago while in western Pennsylvania reporting for what would become Amity and Prosperity: One Family and the Fracturing of America, my book exploring the ways rural Americans have been left behind, and how their disenfranchisement has spawned cultural resentment against liberal, urban Americans. I didn’t understand the nature of that rage until I arrived in Amity, Pennsylvania. I was raised in the eastern part of the state – or commonwealth, as Pennsylvanians prefer to call it. Until my grandmother died, my family had lived on the same land since before the revolutionary war, and my ancestors billeted George Washington’s soldiers at a place called Camp Woods in 1777. Nearly a century later, when the civil war began, my great-great-great grandfather, Gen George Gordon Meade, a well-educated Philadelphian who attended West Point, led the union army at the Battle of Gettysburg, a town lying between the eastern, more urban part of Pennsylvania and the rural west.

While other data on Thursday showed private payrolls rising less than expected last month and a surprise increase in new applications for unemployment benefits last week, overall labor market conditions continue to tighten. The labor market is considered to be near or at full employment, with the jobless rate at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent. The unemployment rate has dropped by three-tenths of a percentage point this year and is near the Federal Reserve’s forecast of 3.6 percent by the end of this year.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.

Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) trashed the June jobs report — even though it showed rapid job growth, rising wages, and low unemployment. The report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that employers created 213,000 new jobs in June — 22,000 more than economists had expected. Manufacturing jobs in particular rose by 36,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.

"And that's what I suspect is happening here. And I think the people of Arizona should be asked what they think, and that's what we're trying to enable." Arizona is one of three states where the billionaire's NextGen Climate Action group pushed ballot initiatives for higher renewable energy standards. Nevada's measure hasn't drawn the same uproar, and the effort in Michigan ended after two utilities decided to increase investments in renewable energy. Benson says Arizona is different partly because of the numbers — the Michigan initiative had a 30 percent renewable mandate compared with 50 percent in Arizona.

At least 41 alleged injuries have been reported, but NHTSA has yet to publicly offer any answers.

The automaker claims it "effectively resolves" the problem. NHTSA has received almost 200 complaints about the issue.

Nielsen founded her own consulting firm, called Sunesis Consulting; she brought on a Bush administration colleague, Elizabeth Neumann, as managing partner, and eventually expanded the suburban Washington firm to 15 people. She continued consulting on cybersecurity issues, becoming a senior fellow at The George Washington University’s Center for Cyber & Homeland Security, and working on reports and presentations on that issue and others for the World Economic Forum—the Swiss nonprofit that puts on an annual summit for global economic heavyweights in Davos, Switzerland. ***

In an abstract way I am interested in finding out how Gilead was formed and where resistance to it might lie, but I cannot stomach any more torture scenes.

"I can tell you that after 30 years, I still have emotional breakdowns and I never know when it's going to hit me," she says. In 2017, there were 346 mass shootings nationwide, including the Las Vegas massacre — one of the deadliest in U.S. history — according to Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit organization that tracks the country's gun-related deaths. The group, which defines mass shootings as ones in which four or more people are killed or injured, has identified 159 so far this year, through July 3. Just last week, a gunman burst into the newsroom of the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Md., killing five journalists and injuring two others. Many of the men and women who respond to these tragedies have become heroes and victims at once.
Straight-A students are being turned away from British medical schools and forced to pay for training in Eastern Europe, while the National Health Service (NHS) plunders the Third World for already-trained doctors instead. The Daily Mail spoke to a number of star students who earned top A-levels and supplemented their CVs with spells volunteering at local GP surgeries, overseas clinics, hospices, and pharmacies — and even earned degrees in related fields such as Biomedical Science — who were turned away from British medical schools, despite the NHS facing a shortfall of some 10,000 doctors. Department of Health and Social Care figures show that only 6,000 of 18,000 medical school applicants were awarded places last year — with many of the 6,000 likely going to foreign applicants, who have often been favoured over British applicants. In fact, the Mail found that so many talented would-be medical students were being rejected that a cottage industry of English-language medical schools in countries such as Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Armenia, and Georgia have sprung up to cater to them — but even this option is not available to youngsters who cannot afford the fees.

Deputies were called multiple times for domestic disputes at the home of a 92-year-old Arizona woman accused of fatally shooting her son, the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office said Thursday. Sheriff Paul Penzone said his office will be will review whether his officers made appropriate judgments in the visits to the Fountain Hills home that preceded the shooting. "Our agency had been to the home a few times prior. The reason we were out was to investigate domestic disputes between the victim and her son and potential threats," Penzone said.
Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.

And Trump's recent record gives him a lot to talk about, Bannon said. "Four percent growth, record low unemployment, China confronted and peace in Korea," Bannon said of what Trump may be able to run on in 2020.
The endangered state of American liberal democracy, he argues, calls for emergency steps from Democrats and the left. They should take advantage of legal and constitutional silences to “transform American politics in a lasting progressive direction,” Faris writes. “Doing so will require party leaders to pursue policy changes that will be ridiculed by their opponents as outrageous affronts to democratic decency and received by their own voters with puzzlement or even shock. They need to do it anyway.”
The list of those changes is dizzying. Grant statehood to D.C. and Puerto Rico, and break California in seven, with the goal of adding 16 new Democrats to the Senate.
President Donald Trump is not responsible for the killing of journalists in Annapolis last week. His belittling of the press — his “enemy of the American people” taunts, his promises to roll back libel laws, his fomenting rage toward specific journalists at rallies — is worth mentioning within the context of the murders, because it speaks to a larger concern that last Thursday’s attack on The Capital Gazette won’t be an isolated incident. Journalists, many of whom already risk their lives covering war and violence, many of whom receive death threats regularly, feel understandable jitters about a leader who tries to turn the American public against us, particularly when we watch a member of that public shoot up a newsroom and end five lives. It’s reckless and inaccurate, though, to pin the shootings on Trump. The suspect swore an oath to kill a Capital writer who wrote about him in 2011.
The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. Teachers are also running a ballot measure campaign that would tax the highest income earners for an additional $690 million to spend on schools. “Regardless of political parties, we need people to make a decision about what’s happening in the classroom,” said Marisol Garcia, vice president of the Arizona Education Association. “To limit ourselves and to say ‘only these people are going to support us’ is just not true.”
Teachers can be at a disadvantage compared to wealthier candidates, who tend to have built-in networks of potential donors.
You can’t push any group of people that hard, that fast and for that long and expect them to maintain their composure.”
Eric Young, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees’ Council of Prison Locals, now prays before he looks at his phone every morning, worried he’ll receive a message from BOP’s director notifying him of a staff death. Young estimates that around two-thirds of his union members were Trump supporters. That makes sense: It’s a law enforcement agency that leans white and male (72 percent male, 62 percent white), and many federal prisons are in rural parts of the country, which Trump dominated. But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau. BOP has long suffered the kind of problems you’d expect for a massive bureaucracy centered on caging tens of thousands of people.

“There are much, much worse Trump nominees they should go after...If I get to talk to Bernie, I’d say vote for him.” Thapar has shown he can be tough on both defendants and the government. He once sentenced a woman to 18 years in prison for assisting her jailed daughter to obtain drugs that killed her. But he also took the side of seven people who lost their disability benefits because their lawyer was accused of obtaining them improperly. Thapur wrote that the seven were given fewer rights by the government than a “member of al-Queda.”
Appointing Amul Thakar to the Supreme Court is an opportunity to make a bold outreach to the most prosperous of America’s immigrant communities and one that is increasingly important politically. The political benefits of naming Thapar are clear.

An organization looking to use data to combat the overwhelming amount of misinformation about Muslims in the media has released an in-depth report to highlight their contributions to society. The Institute for Social Policy and Understanding published the New York City edition of its report, Muslims for American Progress, on Tuesday, finding that as of 2016, there were approximately 768,767 Muslims living in New York City. They make up approximately 9 percent of the city’s total population and over 20 percent of Muslims nationwide, according to ISPU. The report also noted that over 11 percent of New York City’s engineers are Muslim, that Muslim health care workers in the city provided over 6 million appointments to patients, and that Muslim educators taught nearly 250,000 New York City students per year. The report also breaks down Muslims’ contributions in other fields, such as civic engagement, the arts, philanthropy and finance.
Small businesses hired workers at a slower pace in June, the second straight month of weakening job gains despite an overall healthy economy. Payroll company ADP said Thursday it counted 29,000 new jobs at its customers with 49 or fewer employees. This marks a decline from small business job gains of 46,000 in May and 50,000 in April. So far this year, small businesses have been creating on average 46,000 jobs a month. ADP reported that overall private employers added 177,00 jobs last month, a slight drop-off from the average this year of 202,667 a month as companies say they're having a tougher time finding skilled workers.

It was President Obama who left his party in this position. His anti-business agenda was unpopular, but was never revisited. Democrats’ losses over the past decade stemmed in large part from a slow-growth economy that never gained momentum. Even though he received what he called a “shellacking” in the 2010 midterms, and even though the GOP made unprecedented political gains during his tenure, President Obama was always convinced the country was behind him. As Mara Liasson wrote for NPR in 2016: “During Obama's eight years in office, the Democrats have lost more House, Senate, state legislative and governors seats than under any other president.” She noted that the Obama legacy includes “one huge failure: a diminished Democratic Party.”

"Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature. If it places the issue before voters, Nebraska would join Utah, where a ballot measure has been certified, and likely Idaho, where signatures are expected to be certified Friday. Montana's voters may also vote on a measure to extend their existing expansion which is set to expire in 2019. So far, 34 states have approved expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.
There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void. In New Jersey, this is compounded by the fact that the state is located between two big cities, New York and Philadelphia, that are in other states. The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.

"We continue to add renewables to our system, but they have to make sense," Burke said. "It's not really about a target, it's about what makes sense for our customers' usage and what makes rates affordable and what keeps our system reliable." Thirty-two states with renewable standards didn't have, on average, a correlated rate increase, according to Wesley Hersche, an associate director of research with Arizona State University's Global Security Initiative. "These issues involve a complex interaction of factors, and we should be careful not to oversimplify things," Hersche wrote in April.
As motorists pay more to fill their tanks this Independence Day -- with gas prices at a four-year high for the holiday -- safety advocates are urging caution during celebrations that turn deadly on U.S. roadways. The national average for a gallon of gas on Tuesday stood at $2.86, making it the costliest for an Independence Day holiday in four years, according to AAA. That said, the nearly 40 million motorists expected to travel this week will pay 11 cents less per gallon at the pump than they did this past Memorial Day holiday, the motorist club noted. "The national gas price average has held fairly steady for the past 10 days, suggesting that U.S. demand is keeping pace with supply and stabilizing summer gas prices," a spokesperson for the motorist group said in a statement. "However, elevated crude oil prices and other geopolitical concerns could tilt gas prices more expensive in the early fall despite an expected increase in global crude production from OPEC and its partners."

Teddy Roosevelt hopped on whistle stop tour after whistle stop tour where he was able to drop into rural and suburban communities alike to deliver short, pre-packaged speeches that local papers would usually print verbatim. (He left them short on purpose for that very reason.) Franklin Roosevelt revolutionized and heightened the stature of the office with his fireside chats, that brought his message over the heads of the pesky press corps and directly into the living rooms of the American people. But, though it would have been seen as a scoop, even the reporters covering Lyndon B. Johnson had the good sense not to report on every turd he dropped in their presence. While the founders envisioned a government that moved slowly and methodically, today’s Wi-Fi-enabled political discourse is demanding the opposite.
I look very much forward to working with him. There is much to be done that will benefit both the United States and Mexico! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 2, 2018
“I think he’s gonna try and help us with border,” Trump told the reporters. He described “unbelievably bad border laws, immigration laws” in the United States, calling them “the weakest in the world, laughed at by everybody in the world.” He contrasted the U.S. immigration laws with “Mexico’s very strong immigration laws.”
Trump suggested that Mexico can help the United States “until we straighten out our immigration laws, which have been bad for many, many years, decades.” He further assured, “We’re gonna have them taken care of.”

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.

He said many of the people he has talked to were either traveling or away for work when the blaze started Thursday and have not been able to find out the status of their homes. Authorities in Oregon are urging hikers and other outdoors enthusiasts to avoid forested areas near the Oregon-California border, where a blaze has killed one person. The Jackson County Sheriff's Office said Friday that although the blaze has not crossed into Oregon, officials are concerned people in remote areas could be unreachable in case they need to quickly evacuate. It says the areas of concern include the Pacific Crest Trail, Mount Ashland and the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument.

Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. LONDON — Over the past century American and British troops have fought side-by-side in two World Wars, Korea and the conflicts in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan. But some lawmakers and experts in the United Kingdom are warning that the British military could soon be seen as irrelevant by the United States unless it receives a colossal funding boost. "There is a concern that the U.K. is falling ever further behind and becoming even more useless from a U.S. point of view," said Andrew Dorman, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a think tank in London.
It is far from clear they are in a mood to listen.

In the Guardian, Simon Jenkins argues that Theresa May has run out of road and must now face down the Brexit hardliners:
There is no more road. This week the can hits the wall. Theresa May must present her Brussels negotiators with an agreed cabinet template for Brexit, or they, and she, will slither into chaos.
It is a measure of the stakes that even that threat doesn’t guarantee cooperation. At issue is the FBI’s “origin story,” in which it claims its full-fledged investigation into a presidential campaign was conducted, as it were, by the book. According to this narrative, the FBI did not launch its probe until July 31, 2016, only after Australia tipped it to a conversation junior Trump aide George Papadopoulos had with Australian diplomat Alexander Downer in the spring of 2016 in London. Only after this formal commencement of a counterintelligence probe—Crossfire Hurricane—did the FBI begin to target U.S. citizens with spying, wiretapping and other tools usually reserved for foreign infiltrators. Or so the story goes.
These numbers are similar to those from a February Quinnipiac poll, where 49 percent of voters said Trump was racist and 46 percent said he was not. Forty-four percent of voters said they think “racist beliefs” were a motive in Trump’s immigration policy, while 50 percent said Trump has “a sincere interest in controlling our borders.” Sixty percent said the policy of separating children from their parents at the border was a violation of human rights. Since enacting the policy, Trump and his associates have repeatedly pushed false, racist narratives to garner support, often associating immigration with high crime rates despite no evidence to support claims that immigrants commit more crime than U.S. citizens. While only 11 percent of Republican voters in the Quinnipiac poll said they think Trump is a racist, 22 percent said they believe Trump has emboldened racist people to express their beliefs publicly. The number of hate crimes rose the year Trump was elected ― the first increase in over a decade.
S&P 500 e-minis were down 4.5 points, or 0.16 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 15.5 points, or 0.22 percent. Meanwhile, investors awaited the U.S. jobs data for June, when employers likely maintained a brisk pace of hiring while increasing wages for workers. The Labor Department report, due at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to show nonfarm payrolls increased by 195,000 jobs last month, while average hourly earnings are expected to rise 0.3 percent. Just before the tariff deadline, President Donald Trump upped the ante, warning that the United States may ultimately target over $500 billion worth of Chinese goods, or roughly the total amount of U.S. imports from China last year.
Experts Skeptical That North Korea Is Serious About Denuclearizing
Enlarge this image toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is heading back to North Korea on Thursday to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and other senior officials. His mission: to flesh out the details of a vaguely worded joint declaration that Kim signed with President Trump in Singapore last month. In that document, the U.S. pledges security guarantees for North Korea, while North Korea commits to "work toward a complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula." There are doubts, though, about how serious Pyongyang is about doing that. After announcing Pompeo's trip to Pyongyang on Monday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders got a barrage of questions about reports that North Korea is expanding sites tied to its nuclear weapons program and that U.S. intelligence officials don't think Kim intends to relinquish his nuclear arsenal.

This account of the previously undisclosed conversation comes from a senior administration official familiar with what was said. In an exchange that lasted around five minutes, McMaster and others took turns explaining to Trump how military action could backfire and risk losing hard-won support among Latin American governments to punish President Nicolas Maduro for taking Venezuela down the path of dictatorship, according to the official. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the discussions. Although he gave no indication he was about to order up military plans, he pointed to what he considered past cases of successful gunboat diplomacy in the region, according to the official, like the invasions of Panama and Grenada in the 1980s.
Hope Life Center in western Illinois provides unplanned pregnancy counseling and ultrasounds for about five to 10 women a week, with a mission to “erase abortion from Illinois one woman and one child at time,” according to its website. So Executive Director Debbie Case was alarmed by a change last year in the state's so-called right-of-conscience law, requiring health care providers to inform pregnant patients of all available medical options, including abortion. She said the pregnancy center even shut down for part of 2017 because its physician feared potential repercussions of violating the law, which is now temporarily blocked by the courts. Case and other anti-abortion advocates across the state hailed Tuesday’s ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court against a similar law in California on First Amendment grounds, hoping the decision will strengthen their legal battle in Illinois. “We’re definitely encouraged,” said Case, whose center is in Sterling, about two hours west of Chicago.

But sex-worker-rights campaigners say the proposal would be "a disaster". Three organisations - the Sex Worker Advocacy and Resistance Movement (Swarm), the English Collective of Prostitutes (ECP), and the xTalk collective - are planning a demonstration outside Parliament at the time of this Wednesday's debate to protest against the suggested law change. They describe the idea as being a "Trump-inspired" effort to kick sex workers off the internet and put them into "more exploitative and harmful situations". New platforms
The debate follows an official report into sexual exploitation in England and Wales, which was published in May. It concluded that prostitution procurement websites were "the most significant enabler of sex-trafficking in the UK".
Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.

President Donald Trump is not responsible for the killing of journalists in Annapolis last week. His belittling of the press — his “enemy of the American people” taunts, his promises to roll back libel laws, his fomenting rage toward specific journalists at rallies — is worth mentioning within the context of the murders, because it speaks to a larger concern that last Thursday’s attack on The Capital Gazette won’t be an isolated incident. Journalists, many of whom already risk their lives covering war and violence, many of whom receive death threats regularly, feel understandable jitters about a leader who tries to turn the American public against us, particularly when we watch a member of that public shoot up a newsroom and end five lives. It’s reckless and inaccurate, though, to pin the shootings on Trump. The suspect swore an oath to kill a Capital writer who wrote about him in 2011.

Abbott said on Tuesday night he never conceived of climate change as a moral challenge. “It was an issue, that’s all, and – at least on the actual changes we’ve so far seen – not a very significant one compared to man’s inhumanity to man; maintaining and improving living standards; and even to many other environmental issues such as degraded bush and waterways, particulate pollution, water quality in the third world, deforestation and urban overcrowding.”
He contended that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide from roughly 300 to 400 parts per million over the last century had not triggered “dramatic consequences”. Play Video 0:32 Andrew Probyn calls Tony Abbott 'destructive' in ABC report – video

"To be absolutely clear: no one at Google reads your Gmail, except in very specific cases where you ask us to and give consent, or where we need to for security purposes, such as investigating a bug or abuse," Frey wrote today. The report, however, comes shortly after Facebook faced a huge PR nightmare when a third party—the now-defunct Cambridge Analytica—got its hands on the data of up to 87 million Facebook users.

At his state funeral, Trudeau delivered an emotional eulogy that launched him onto the national stage and catalyzed his career in politics. As prime minister, he has crafted a persona as a woke heartthrob. His wrote an essay for Marie Claire about raising boys as feminists and spoke at Davos about sexual harassment as a “systemic issue.” At a U.N. youth event last fall, he lambasted “bro culture” from the stage. “How we treat our sisters, our girlfriends, our cousins, our mothers and the world around us matters,” he said, as the crowd screamed with approval. “The world is changing, the rules are changing, but what they change into and how they change, depends not on leaders in government offices or in businesses, it depends on citizens, it depends on you.”

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.

"Nancy, I believe, is one of the greatest speakers we ever had, and will once again be one of the greatest speakers we ever have after we get through this cycle," he continued. “And there's not much I could have gotten done without having Nancy there alongside of me every step of the way.”

The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. Teachers are also running a ballot measure campaign that would tax the highest income earners for an additional $690 million to spend on schools. “Regardless of political parties, we need people to make a decision about what’s happening in the classroom,” said Marisol Garcia, vice president of the Arizona Education Association. “To limit ourselves and to say ‘only these people are going to support us’ is just not true.”
Teachers can be at a disadvantage compared to wealthier candidates, who tend to have built-in networks of potential donors.

"Peace and tranquility are the fruits of justice," Lopez Obrador said. Exit polling by Consulta Mitofsky for the Televisa network forecast gubernatorial wins for allies of Lopez Obrador's Morena party in at least four of eight state races on the ballot plus for the head of government in Mexico City. The central state of Guanajuato was expected to go to a candidate of the conservative National Action Party. Mitofsky predicted Morena allies would take between 56 and 70 seats in the 128-member Senate and between 256 and 291 spots in the 500-seat lower house. "The anger that the average Mexican feels toward the way things are being governed has favored Lopez Obrador," said Shannon O'Neil, senior fellow for Latin America Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.

Our Founding Fathers resolved that without freedom Americans could not enjoy life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. To secure it, they fought a war to break free from the bonds of tyranny. It isn’t a faraway tyrant that oppresses us today. Rather, we are in the grip of a new kind of tyranny — that of mistrust. This tyrant sits on a throne in our minds and is just as cruel as King George was during the time of the Founders.
'We're in the abyss': how despair in Mexico set 'Amlo' on verge of presidency Read more
For months, polls have given López Obrador, or Amlo as most call him, a 20-point lead over his closest rival, a 39-year-old lawyer and yoga aficionado called Ricardo Anaya. “We can already affirm that Andrés Manuel López Obrador is the next president of the Republic,” Claudia Sheinbaum, a close Amlo ally tipped to become Mexico City’s next mayor, told jubilant fans at his final pre-election rally on Wednesday night. “I am convinced we are standing at the gates of a new era.”
About 100,000 lopezobradoristas had reportedly packed Mexico City’s Azteca Stadium for the rock concert-style jamboree – the final act in a punishing six-month campaign that has seen Amlo repeatedly crisscross Mexico with his promises to wipe out corruption and pump the recovered funds into social projects. “[Corruption] is the main cause of social inequality and economic inequality – and insecurity and violence also stem from corruption,” Amlo, who is making his third bid for the presidency, said in his eve-of-election address. “We will get rid of this corruption, this cancer, that is destroying this country.”
Outside, street hawkers peddled T-shirts and trinkets emblazoned with the image and the gospel of a man who followers describe in quasi-religious terms and detractors dismiss as Mexico’s populist “tropical messiah”.
Straight-A students are being turned away from British medical schools and forced to pay for training in Eastern Europe, while the National Health Service (NHS) plunders the Third World for already-trained doctors instead. The Daily Mail spoke to a number of star students who earned top A-levels and supplemented their CVs with spells volunteering at local GP surgeries, overseas clinics, hospices, and pharmacies — and even earned degrees in related fields such as Biomedical Science — who were turned away from British medical schools, despite the NHS facing a shortfall of some 10,000 doctors. Department of Health and Social Care figures show that only 6,000 of 18,000 medical school applicants were awarded places last year — with many of the 6,000 likely going to foreign applicants, who have often been favoured over British applicants. In fact, the Mail found that so many talented would-be medical students were being rejected that a cottage industry of English-language medical schools in countries such as Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Armenia, and Georgia have sprung up to cater to them — but even this option is not available to youngsters who cannot afford the fees.

But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said. Tackett said he's concerned about children, especially in Eastern Kentucky, which has a higher rate of Medicaid patients and some of the state's worst oral health. "I have no problem with them regulating the adults that are on Medicaid," Tackett said. "If they are young and healthy, they should be out working or doing something.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services sector activity picked up in June amid strong growth in new orders, but trade tariffs and a shortage of workers were starting to strain the supply chain, which could slow momentum in the coming months.

While other data on Thursday showed private payrolls rising less than expected last month and a surprise increase in new applications for unemployment benefits last week, overall labor market conditions continue to tighten. The labor market is considered to be near or at full employment, with the jobless rate at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent. The unemployment rate has dropped by three-tenths of a percentage point this year and is near the Federal Reserve’s forecast of 3.6 percent by the end of this year.
Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.

Jaguar Land Rover, Britain's biggest carmaker with 40,000 employees, cautioned this week that a bad deal would slash its profits by £1.2 billion ($1.6 billion) a year. Airbus (EADSF) and BMW (BMWYY) also issued dire warnings. The plan announced Friday acknowledges that banking and other UK service industries, which make up the vast majority of the UK economy, would lose some access to European markets. But Britain's biggest business lobby group, the Confederation of British Industry, welcomed Friday's announcement as a "good starting point." "This is a genuine confidence boost and the prime minister deserves credit for delivering a unified approach" said Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director general, in a statement.
Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) trashed the June jobs report — even though it showed rapid job growth, rising wages, and low unemployment. The report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that employers created 213,000 new jobs in June — 22,000 more than economists had expected. Manufacturing jobs in particular rose by 36,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.
In the lead-up to the upcoming NATO summit in Brussels, President Donald Trump has reportedly sent “sharply worded letters” to the leaders of several NATO allies, escalating his long-simmering feud with the military alliance. The New York Times reported Monday that the letters, sent last month to leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Prime Minister Charles Michel of Belgium, rebuked NATO allies for not spending enough on their own defense ― a criticism that Trump has repeatedly leveled against other alliance members. The president also suggested in the letters that the U.S. would consider reducing its military commitment globally if its allies don’t ramp up spending, reported the Times. In his letter to Merkel, Trump reportedly wrote: “There is growing frustration in the United States that some allies have not stepped up as promised. The United States continues to devote more resources to the defense of Europe when the Continent’s economy, including Germany’s, are doing well and security challenges abound.
3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.
“These people see in Brexit the chance to turn Britain into the low-wage, deregulated, race-to-the-bottom society of their dreams.

The report also said that Strzok repeatedly pushed for more aggressive action in the Clinton probe. "The conduct by these employees cast a cloud over the entire FBI investigation and sowed doubt about the FBI’s work," the report concluded. "The damage caused by these employees’ actions extends far beyond the scope of the (Clinton) investigation and goes to the heart of the FBI’s reputation for neutral fact finding and political independence." Goelman, in an op-ed in USA TODAY last month, said Strzok has become the victim of "political gamesmanship" by Congress and President Trump, who has repeatedly tweeted about Strzok as evidence of bias by the FBI and Justice Department. "They have spent months cynically taking these texts out of context and saying that one- or two-word snippets somehow prove that the FBI investigations of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the Russia probe itself, were biased," Goelman wrote.
PORTLAND, Ore. -- Two opposing protest groups -- Patriot Prayer and antifa -- clashed in downtown Portland Saturday, CBS Portland affiliate KOIN reports. Portland police said failure to leave the area could leave to arrests, calling the demonstration a riot. More than 100 members of Patriot Prayer group gathered at Terry Schrunk Plaza for a "freedom rally," while more than 100 counter protesters with an antifa group gathered across the street at Chapman Square for rallies before a march. Police revoked Patriot Prayer's permit for the rally after the two groups began to clash. People were lighting firecrackers and smoke bombs in the crowd while police used flash bangs in an effort to disperse the clashing protesters.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) tweeted a still more vague yet somehow more expansive vision Tuesday, calling for “restructuring the agencies that enforce our immigration laws, including ICE.”
Such aspirationalism allows establishment Democrats to harness the power behind the idea of abolishing ICE without taking a meaningful position on the underlying goal that animates that movement ― to radically undercut the government’s deportation efforts.
In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners.

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has promoted 16,900 soldiers as a reward for their "loyalty". The promotion comes amid a worsening economic and political crisis during which opposition politicians have called on the armed forces to side "with the people". Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino said those promoted had been "loyal to the constitutionally elected president". He also praised them "for respecting human rights". The promotion comes just 10 days after the UN human rights body released a report saying that Venezuelan security forces had carried out hundreds of arbitrary killings.

But they split almost down the middle, 42 percent to 39 percent, when asked whether they are proud of America right now. Not surprisingly, the split was along partisan lines: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now.

The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.

It has been 536 days since power-sharing in Northern Ireland collapsed - 536 days without ministers to oversee the running of Stormont's nine departments. In the absence of an executive, civil servants were left uncertain about what decisions to take, and who should take them. The long-running court case over the proposed Arc21 waste incinerator in County Antrim raised questions about exactly that conundrum. The judgement upholding a ruling that a senior civil servant did not have the power to act without ministerial approval in the case of the incinerator could have massive implications for future governance in Northern Ireland. Here are some of the key parts of the judgement and what they mean.
Jose Arizmendi, 54, a native of Mexico, pleaded guilty in April 1996 to aggravated sexual assault of a child in the District Court of Harris County, Texas … When the Department of Justice filed a complaint in federal court to initiate denaturalization proceedings in February 2015, Arizmendi was serving an 18-year prison sentence in Mexico for a separate sex offense of rape that he committed in that country. Araceli Martinez aka Maria Araceli Ramos de Martinez, 53, a native of Mexico, pleaded guilty in September 2012 to Obtaining Money, Labor or Property by False Pretense in violation of California Penal Code § 532(a) in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles. Between June 2011 and March 2012, Martinez engaged in a scheme in which she impersonated a U.S. immigration officer. Fosia Abdi Adan, 51, a native of Somalia, applied for and received a diversity visa from the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, Yemen, under the Diversity Visa (DV) Program on Jan. 10, 2001, and used her visa to unlawfully obtain beneficiary visas for the below individuals who were ineligible to be beneficiaries. Adan arrived and was admitted to the United States on Jan. 29, 2001, on her diversity immigrant visa as a permanent resident.
“We are conscious of the need to maintain good relations with the United States. We have a border of more than 3,000 kilometers, more than 12 million Mexicans live in the United States.

President Trump had suggested lifting the prohibition, which environmentalists charge would raise levels of ground ozone during warmer months, during his campaign for the White House. Following the news of Mr. Pruitt’s resignation, Mr. Dinneen wrote that there was a “collective sigh of relief coming from the Midwest,” calling the 2019 ethanol quotas “the straw that broke the camel’s back.”
While it is too early to say how the handling of waivers or the treatment of E15 may change under new leadership, one indicator was small losses in affected refiners in early Friday trading and gains in most ethanol producers. CVR Refining, Andeavor and Delek U.S. Holdings , all of which benefited from waivers granted by the EPA, had rallied by 136%, 40% and 92% in the year ended Thursday, respectively. Ethanol companies Pacific Ethanol and Green Plains had fallen by 60% and 14%, respectively. Agricultural lobbyists often portray any easing of the rules as a sop to “big oil,” but that isn’t accurate.
He took a short position in shipping company Navigator Holdings worth between $100,001 and $250,000 on Oct. 31, five days after the New York Times contacted him about an article linking Navigator indirectly to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ross told CNBC earlier this week that he also shorted shares in Air Lease and Ocwen Financial. Ross, who plays a key role in increasingly high-stakes trade talks, says those sales were part of divestments made to work in government and he didn’t profit from those transactions. Democratic lawmakers are increasingly concerned, though. Last week, three members of Congress asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate whether Ross violated insider-trading laws.
Bishop John Bauerschmidt, who oversees the Middle Tennessee region of the church, stands firmly by his decision not to authorize their use, nor allow clergy within his diocese to officiate the religious ceremonies or permit the weddings on church property. In doing so, the bishop says he is being faithful to his job of guarding the discipline, faith and unity of the church.

"The teaching that Christian marriage is between a man and a woman is reasonable, traditional, and scriptural," Bauerschmidt said in an email. "There really is nothing remarkable about a Christian bishop who holds to this teaching." While Bishops can place limitations on the use of the marriage liturgies, they must refer couples to a willing diocese if they do not authorize them.
“I was defending myself,” Sumpter said during the hearing. Judge John Blawie told Sumpter that he believed his version of events, but had to follow the letter of the law. Under Connecticut law, assault victims cannot use deadly force if they are able to retreat from their attackers. By contrast, 27 states — most notably Florida — have passed so-called “stand-your-ground” laws, which entitle citizens to use force in self-defense if there is a reasonable belief of a threat. The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Those factories are the core of an American operation that employs about 136,000 people, but they're also dependent on components sourced overseas for reasons of cost or availability. About 70 percent of the parts in a U.S.-built Camry, the country's best-selling car, come from domestic suppliers. Toyota on June 27 said that Trump's threatened 25 percent tariff on automotive imports would add $1,800 to the price of each sedan. The carmaker's warning of the dangers of tit-for-tat tariffs was just one of many. German lighting manufacturer Osram Licht's shares plunged 22 percent Thursday after it announced a weaker outlook due to trade tensions.

The new law - approved by 87 votes to 15 in the 120-seat Knesset late on Monday - requires the Israeli government to withhold an amount of tax revenue equal to what is paid by the PA to "individuals who were involved in terror activity against Israelis and their families". If the defence ministry determines that such payments are no longer being made, the frozen funds will be returned to the PA.
Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman hailed the legislation, saying: "An effective war on terrorism also passes through the pocket - of the terrorists, of their families and of [Palestinian Authority President] Mahmoud Abbas." Image copyright AFP Image caption The law's sponsors said the PA's payments were "an expression of support for acts of terror"
But chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat condemned what he called a "very dangerous decision that amounts to the cancellation of the Palestinian Authority and is piracy and theft". The PA's Minister of Prisoner Affairs, Issa Qaraqeh, meanwhile insisted the payments would continue. "When we signed Oslo Agreement, it was clear to Israel that the Palestinian Authority pays these families, and they never objected," he was quoted as saying by the Associated Press.
Some immigrant U.S. Army reservists and recruits who enlisted in the military with a promised path to citizenship are being abruptly discharged, the Associated Press has learned. The AP was unable to quantify how many men and women who enlisted through the special recruitment program have been booted from the Army, but immigration attorneys say they know of more than 40 who have been discharged or whose status has become questionable, jeopardizing their futures. "It was my dream to serve in the military," said reservist Lucas Calixto, a Brazilian immigrant who filed a lawsuit against the Army last week. "Since this country has been so good to me, I thought it was the least I could do to give back to my adopted country and serve in the United States military." Some of the service members say they were not told why they were being discharged.
It was described as a tense meeting, the BBC's Norman Smith said. Mrs May is trying to find an arrangement to unite her cabinet when ministers gather at her country retreat, Chequers, on Friday. The UK is leaving the EU in March 2019, but has yet to agree how it will trade with the remaining EU members - who are part of a single market and a customs union - in years to come. Some former Remain campaigners want the government to pursue close ties to the EU to avoid barriers to trade with Europe - but Eurosceptics say the UK needs freedom to set its own independent trade policy. After two alternative models for customs were criticised, Downing Street has come up with what it calls a "third way" solution to be presented on Friday, claiming it will offer "the best of both worlds" - frictionless trade with Europe and the freedom to strike international trade deals.
Crimes such as robbery remain rampant across Venezuela amid the country’s dire economic and humanitarian crisis, leading growing numbers of people to turn to violence merely to ensure survival. Kidnappings, armed robberies, and violent attacks are now commonplace. Venezuela is widely considered one of the most dangerous destinations in the world. As noted by El Nacional, “There are many travelers who have been stripped of money, luggage, and vehicles on the Caracas-La Guaira highway, especially at night and early morning when the road is little traveled and lacks surveillance.”
The doctors were present in Venezuela as part of an agreement between the two countries. Venezuela typically pays for the doctors in vast quantities of oil, an initiative that started under Hugo Chávez and Fidel Castro.
Because it is also a flood plain, the project’s 989,000 solar panels will be mounted on frames 12ft tall – the height of a double-decker bus. Unlike most solar farms, Cleve Hill Solar Park’s panels will not all face south, but east and west in a continuous zig-zag. The effect, say the scheme’s opponents, will be to turn green meadows into something resembling a colossal factory roof. Economically and environmentally the scheme makes no sense whatsoever. Apart from ruining a huge swathe of countryside and killing or displacing all the local wildlife, it will do little for Britain’s energy needs.

The apprehension migrants who illegally cross the U.S. southwestern border between ports of entry fell by 18 percent in June following tougher enforcement actions taken by the Trump Administration. “Following the implementation of the Administration’s zero-tolerance policy, the June 2018 Southwest Border Migration numbers declined by 18 percent when compared to the previous month,” Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Press Secretary Tyler Q. Houlton said in a written statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. “DHS will continue to enforce the rule of law and uphold our nation’s immigration laws as passed by Congress,” Houlton continued. “As we have said before, the journey north is dangerous and puts individuals in the hands of smugglers and traffickers.”
Border Patrol agents arrested 34,114 illegal immigrants between the southwestern border ports of entry, officials stated in the June Southwest Border Migration Report. This number represents a decrease of 6,224 migrants arrested (18 percent).
The budget was the first hard issue on which the governor and Senate president had to work together or face potentially politically catastrophic results. Had they not reached an agreement, thousands of state workers would have been furloughed and state parks and beaches would have shut down. Initially, Murphy wanted a tax on all income over $1 million and a slight increase in the state sales tax to 7 percent from 6.625 percent. Sweeney, who in previous years had supported a millionaire's tax, was now opposed, instead calling for a temporary increase in the corporate business tax. On Saturday morning, about 13 hours before the midnight shutdown deadline, their rhetoric remained heated.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
The vast majority of swing voters across the United States oppose the Democrats’ latest plan to abolish all immigration enforcement by ending the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. In recent weeks, Democrats in the House and Senate, along with progressive liberals like Cynthia Nixon in New York and most recently insurgent Democrat candidate for Congress, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have been demanding ICE be abolished and all immigration enforcement be ended. House Democrats are now crafting legislation that would officially abolish ICE. The latest Harvard/Harris Poll, though, reveals that swing voters are overwhelmingly opposed to the Democrats’ plan to end all immigration enforcement across the U.S.
Nearly 3-in-4 swing voters, about 73 percent, of swing voters said they do not want ICE to be disbanded. Less than 30 percent of swing voters said they support the abolishment of ICE.
Dec. 7, 2016: Trump announces that Pruitt will be his nominee for EPA administrator
The then-Attorney General of Oklahoma was touted by Trump as having "great qualifications and a good record." Part of that record was Pruitt touting himself as a "leading advocate against the EPA's activist agenda," and his history of challenging the EPA was well known. Feb. 17, 2017: Confirmed by the Senate
Pruitt's confirmation, which was approved with a vote of 52-46, came in the midst of a court order that required him to turn over thousands of communications with major coal, oil and gas companies from his time in office. Democratic senators expressed outrage that Republicans were going ahead as scheduled with the vote on Pruitt, despite the judge’s ruling in the order. March 23, 2017: Defends budget cuts to his agency
The budget plan put forward by the Trump administration proposed cuts 31 percent of the EPA’s funding, including significant reductions to research programs and enforcement of clean air and clean water programs, but that didn’t bother Pruitt.
As we previously argued in Slate, the administration’s family separations were plainly unconstitutional. The district court agreed, at least for the purposes of a preliminary injunction. Under the orders, children younger than 5 must be reunited with their families within 14 days of the order. The court ruled that children 5 and older must be reunited within 30 days. Reporting since the court issued its order indicates that the government does not intend to abide by the order.

XI ASSERTS TERRITORIAL CLAIMS IN MEETING WITH US DEFENSE SECRETARY
Chinese President Xi Jinping strongly asserted China's determination to defend territory it claims, including in the South China Sea, in a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. While the tone of Mattis' visit to Beijing was largely upbeat, Xi made sure to reinforce his reputation as a fervent nationalist when it comes to issues of sovereignty. Though Xi gave no specifics in his statement, he was largely seen as indicating the South China Sea as well as self-governing Taiwan. China also claims territory held by India and uninhabited East China Sea islands controlled by Japan.
"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.

In the survey, most say they are proud to be Americans, although Republicans feel that way more strongly (90 percent) than Democrats (61 percent). There is no consensus when asked about the country’s current course, though: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. “Overwhelming majorities of those in both parties and independents agree that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.”” USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll

The court documents detail the accounts of four unnamed women, identified as Jane Does 1, 2, 3, and 4. Local reports cited depositions that Large took before his death wherein he reportedly admitted to suggesting some of the women participate in "catfight videos" for money, but he denied the claims of sexual assault. Now his five of his former supervisors, police department, and Horry County officials are facing claims from two of the victims, Jane Does 3 and 4, for allegedly failing to prevent years of egregious abuse. Large died in January, 16 months after he was indicted. On Monday, a judge rejected a motion for summary judgment from the defendants and decided the case would move forward with a trial against the Horry County Police Department and Horry County.
Small businesses hired workers at a slower pace in June, the second straight month of weakening job gains despite an overall healthy economy. Payroll company ADP said Thursday it counted 29,000 new jobs at its customers with 49 or fewer employees. This marks a decline from small business job gains of 46,000 in May and 50,000 in April. So far this year, small businesses have been creating on average 46,000 jobs a month. ADP reported that overall private employers added 177,00 jobs last month, a slight drop-off from the average this year of 202,667 a month as companies say they're having a tougher time finding skilled workers.
Republican Senate candidate and Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley launched a new website on Tuesday attacking incumbent Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) for her past and future votes on candidates nominated by President Trump for the Supreme Court. “Claire McCaskill has been wrong on EVERY Supreme Court pick,” the above-the-fold headline on the new www.supremeclaire.com website reads. The web site then notes five facts about McCaskill’s record of supporting President Obama’s Supreme Court nominees, while opposing President Trump’s:
Claire McCaskill has been wrong on the last five Supreme Court nominees. McCaskill opposed conservatives Alito and Gorsuch. McCaskill voted in favor of filibustering Neil Gorsuch.
He said he supports the project and wants to see it succeed “more than anybody.”
Moore said he knows Obama dating back to the former president’s days as an Illinois state senator running for Congress, driving with him to community meetings and even going as a surrogate for him once or twice.
Practice is only one of Deborah Glass’s 125 recommendations not accepted by Victorian government
Female prisoners in Victoria are still subject to “abusive” routine strip searches, a state government watchdog says. The Victorian ombudsman, Deborah Glass, said the government has failed to adopt a recommendation from her 2015 report into the prison system that called for an end to the searches. “Why has the government not accepted my recommendation to stop the abusive practice of routinely strip-searching women prisoners – in fact, the only recommendation out of 125 not accepted?” she asked on Wednesday. The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year.
The U.S. economy continues to show strength in the wake of tax reform and deregulation, but the downside of robust growth is that Donald Trump thinks this means he can dabble at trade war with impunity. He ought to look at the signs that growth would be even stronger if not for his border-tax brawls. The latest evidence came in the minutes released Thursday from the Federal Open Market Committee’s June meeting. Fed district presidents from around the U.S. reported evidence of strong growth, but along the way came this warning:
Foreign Edition Podcast
“However, many District contacts expressed concern about the possible adverse effects of tariffs and other proposed trade restrictions, both domestically and abroad, on future investment activity; contacts in some Districts indicated that plans for capital spending had been scaled back or postponed as a result of uncertainty over trade policy.”
The minutes continued: “Contacts in the steel and aluminum industries expected higher prices as a result of the tariffs on these products but had not planned any new investments to increase capacity. Conditions in the agricultural sector reportedly improved somewhat, but contacts were concerned about the effect of potentially higher tariffs on their exports.”
These reports are from the economy’s ground floor, not the Beltway penthouse.
Many Americans gaze at the sky and see only a vast uncharted frontier for exploration. But President Donald Trump reminds Americans that there’s another potential reality in space: It could become a military battlefield, a place where this nation’s independence is protected or lost. The point isn’t to repel an alien invasion from deep space. We’re not worried about Klingons. But Americans do have reason to be concerned about technologically advancing adversaries here on Earth.
The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.
Hamilton, the Republican state lawmaker who beat the incumbent Karnes, won with a mix of support from teachers and other unions. While Karnes sparred with teachers during the strike, Hamilton took a moderate position. He aligned with teachers unions by opposing state right-to-work legislation and the proposed repeal of prevailing wage laws for public construction projects. The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.
“Sea levels have hardly risen and temperatures are still below those of the medieval warm period. Over time, temperature change seems to correlate rather more with sun spot activity than with carbon dioxide levels. “And even if carbon dioxide, a naturally occurring trace gas that’s necessary for life, really is the main climate change villain, Australia’s contribution to mankind’s emissions is scarcely more than 1%.”
Abbott framed his contribution not as a deliberate wrecking exercise but as an effort to “save” the government. “Far from wrecking the government, MPs worried about energy policy are trying to save it, with a policy that would be different from Labor’s and would give voters the affordable and reliable power they want.”
The definition of drug dealer
More and more, trouble is following fellow drug users, friends and relatives of those dying from overdoses. With the country's opioid crisis widening – having killed more people in 2016, for instance, than the deadliest year of the AIDs epidemic – bystanders to fatal overdoses are increasingly becoming criminal defendants. Pennsylvania prosecutors in Delaware County who are pursuing the case against Santa Barbara declined an interview request. But among the criminal charges they are pressing against her is drug delivery resulting in death, a first-degree felony carrying the maximum punishment of 20 to 40 years in prison. In Pennsylvania, the number of people charged with this version of third-degree murder from an accidental overdose went from 15 in 2013 to 205 last year.

It’s not strictly true to say everyone is against the three huge plant-forested glass spheres at what Amazon calls its “campus” in the heart of the city. The Bezos balls, as the conservatories are popularly known, are modelled on the greenhouses at London’s Kew Gardens, feature walkways above fig trees, ferns and rhododendrons, and provide hot-desking for Amazon workers looking for a break from the neighbouring office tower. There was nothing in that area 10 years ago,” said Jen Reed, selling jerky from another market stall. “I don’t hate Amazon the way that a lot of people hate them.

POLITICO Playbook: Michael Cohen speaks
NEW YORK, NY - MAY 30: Michael Cohen, (C) former personal lawyer and confidante for President Donald Trump, exits the United States District Court Southern District of New York on May 30, 2018 in New York City. According to a filing submitted to the court Tuesday night by special master Barbara Jones, federal prosecutors investigating Michael Cohen, a longtime personal lawyer and confidante for President Donald Trump, are set to receive 1 million files from three of his cellphones that were seized last month.

BREAKING ... ABC NEWS' GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS SPOKE TO MICHAEL COHEN: "Michael Cohen says family and country, not President Trump, is his 'first loyalty'": "When I asked Cohen directly what he would do if prosecutors forced him to choose between protecting the president and protecting his family, he said his family is 'my first priority.' "Cohen added: 'Once I understand what charges might be filed against me, if any at all, I will defer to my new counsel, Guy Petrillo, for guidance.' Story Continued Below
"But when I pointed out to Cohen that he wasn’t repeating past vows to 'take a bullet' and 'do anything' to protect the president, the longtime Trump loyalist left little doubt about where he stands now, saying simply: 'To be crystal clear, my wife, my daughter and my son, and this country have my first loyalty.'

Scott Pruitt has resigned as head of the Environmental Protection Agency after a string of controversies involving his leadership, President Trump announced Thursday on Twitter. "Within the Agency Scott has done an outstanding job, and I will always be thankful to him for this," tweeted Trump, who added that EPA Deputy Administrator Andrew Wheeler would take over as acting administrator effective Monday. "I have no doubt that Andy will continue on with our great and lasting EPA agenda," Trump concluded. "We have made tremendous progress and the future of the EPA is very bright!" In his resignation letter to Trump, Pruitt said: "It is extremely difficult for me to cease serving you in this role first because I count it a blessing to be serving you in any capacity, but also, because of the transformative work that is occurring.
"'I will not be a punching bag as part of anyone’s defense strategy,' he said emphatically. 'I am not a villain of this story, and I will not allow others to try to depict me that way.' ...
"I asked Cohen if the president directed him to make that payment or promised to reimburse him. In the past, Cohen has said that he acted on his own initiative.
Jose Arizmendi, 54, a native of Mexico, pleaded guilty in April 1996 to aggravated sexual assault of a child in the District Court of Harris County, Texas … When the Department of Justice filed a complaint in federal court to initiate denaturalization proceedings in February 2015, Arizmendi was serving an 18-year prison sentence in Mexico for a separate sex offense of rape that he committed in that country. Araceli Martinez aka Maria Araceli Ramos de Martinez, 53, a native of Mexico, pleaded guilty in September 2012 to Obtaining Money, Labor or Property by False Pretense in violation of California Penal Code § 532(a) in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles. Between June 2011 and March 2012, Martinez engaged in a scheme in which she impersonated a U.S. immigration officer. Fosia Abdi Adan, 51, a native of Somalia, applied for and received a diversity visa from the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, Yemen, under the Diversity Visa (DV) Program on Jan. 10, 2001, and used her visa to unlawfully obtain beneficiary visas for the below individuals who were ineligible to be beneficiaries. Adan arrived and was admitted to the United States on Jan. 29, 2001, on her diversity immigrant visa as a permanent resident.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services sector activity picked up in June amid strong growth in new orders, but trade tariffs and a shortage of workers were starting to strain the supply chain, which could slow momentum in the coming months.

While other data on Thursday showed private payrolls rising less than expected last month and a surprise increase in new applications for unemployment benefits last week, overall labor market conditions continue to tighten. The labor market is considered to be near or at full employment, with the jobless rate at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent. The unemployment rate has dropped by three-tenths of a percentage point this year and is near the Federal Reserve’s forecast of 3.6 percent by the end of this year.
But North Korea still prefers a step-by-step disarmament process with reciprocal concessions and benefits from the United States for each of the North's denuclearization steps. The ultimate rewards North Korea wants range from the easing or lifting of American-led international sanctions, the signing of a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, the establishment of diplomatic ties and the pulling out of U.S. troops in South Korea, experts say. During Pompeo's visit, North Korea is expected to ask the United States to consider signing a peace treaty to prolong a peace mood and find ways to seek sanctions relief, Go said. Whatever U.S. concessions and rewards North Korea gets, however, some experts say North Korea will likely push to scrap only some of its nuclear capability, not all. They believe North Korea thinks Trump would settle for a partial denuclearization deal to avoid a total failure in his North Korea policy in the face of political woes at home.
It looks much less attractive to global players. It's for the smaller companies with a focus on exploiting mature reserves. In Aberdeen, Faroe Petroleum might be interested, but its attentions are probably focused on a siege by a Norwegian firm/investor. Ineos might also have an eye to buying, though it just announced its next vast investment plan is for more than £3bn-worth of shale gas cracker plant "on the coast of north-west Europe".

He had a small team of allies and has built his political life with them. The big exception was during this election he realized astutely that no one can win by himself. He has built a large coalition that includes a far-right party completely opposed to progressive politics. He has done so because he needed them to win. How will he behave toward those members of his very odd coalition is anyone’s guess.

The family of five headed for Tal Shihab,near Quneitra province, and are staying at a home belonging to friends. “I wish I could have helped other families to escape, but unfortunately I only have this motorbike,” he says.
As well as a new president, Mexican will be voting for 128 senators and 500 deputies in Congress as well as state and local officials. In all, 88 million people will be eligible to vote. Mexico is the second largest economy in Latin America and a major oil exporter. However, oil prices have dropped and the Mexican currency, the peso, has fallen sharply against the dollar. More than 40% of the population lives in poverty and high levels of corruption and violence have led some companies to pull out of the worst affected areas.

Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey has apologised to Parliament for making "inadvertently misleading" statements about Universal Credit. She said she had "mistakenly" told MPs on Monday the National Audit Office felt the benefit was progressing too slowly and should be rolled out faster. The head of the spending watchdog had said the claims were "incorrect" as it had reservations about the process. Labour had called on Ms McVey to apologise or "consider her position". Ms McVey told MPs that she had meant to say that the spending watchdog believed there was "no practical alternative" to the development of Universal Credit, which rolls six benefits into one.
That came on the heels of 0.9 percent drop in March, the first monthly drop since July of 2017. Total private construction rose 0.3 percent, with residential projects up 0.8 percent in May. New single-family home construction rose 0.6 percent and the volatile apartment building sector jumped 1.6 percent. Private, non-residential building fell 0.3 percent. Economists are forecasting that construction spending will contribute to overall growth this year even though interest rates are rising.
Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.

Tangredi said he hopes the threat of a trade war will force China to rethink its practices: "You've got to do something to get their attention."

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
DAVIS: They are the three red-state Democrats who are up for re-election this year in states that Donald Trump won big. That's Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. We should note, President Trump is headed to West Virginia tonight for a campaign rally. He's already been at a campaign rally in North Dakota.
That's more than all but three Democratic senators (Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana), all of whom are from red states and facing re-election this fall. "I think he's terrific," Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., who also faces a tough re-election fight, said in an interview. "It's harder work when you're not interested in voting the party line. You've got to look at every issue from all sides." "I really have been pleasantly surprised how willing he is to tell Chuck Schumer to go fly a kite," she added, referring to the Senate minority leader.
Though they won’t admit it, Democrats are suffering continued fallout from the arrogance of the Obama White House. Liberals are furious that President Trump will have the opportunity to appoint another justice to the Supreme Court, thus cementing a conservative majority for the foreseeable future. Moreover, liberals are upset that the Trump administration may have convinced Justice Anthony Kennedy to recently announce his retirement, viewing that effort as dirty pool. That Kennedy, age 81, is nobody’s fool – and is unlikely to have been manipulated – appears irrelevant. The real offense, which actually merits outrage from the left, is that President Obama did not convince liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to retire during the many years that Democrats controlled the Senate.
Did he display these tendencies? He was a fairly good mayor. He used his term as mayor many times during the campaign [to show] how he was more pragmatic rather than authoritarian. And in that he is correct. He was also fairly popular as mayor and ended his term with a very respectable approval rating.
On this much police and activist South Side priest Michael Pfleger can agree: Saturday morning’s anti-violence march on the Dan Ryan Expressway is all about danger. Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.
3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.

The rally began with the prayer group’s permitted march from Portland’s Terry Schrunk Federal Plaza. The event was organized by activist Joey Gibson, a U.S. Senate candidate for Washington and leader of Patriot Prayer. The AntiFa group organized some distance away but not before police seized weapons such as utility knives, clubs and chemical sprays, according to The Oregonian. Despite the confiscations, the AntiFa group initiated hostilities by throwing eggs, bottles, and other items at the Patriot group, the paper noted.
We look at other parts of the world, where women are not allowed to vote, or dance, and we see ourselves as modern and liberated. But all our “freedoms” are fairly recent, from being able to get a mortgage to being protected from rape in marriage. The narrative of progress is one that too many liberals imbibe, but it is untrue. In many of the areas to which we turn when we measure gender equality, we have not moved forward for the past 10 years – income, political engagement, education.

Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.
About four years ago, Dais had lined up a Chinese company to help develop its business in nanotechnology that helps produce clean water. Tangredi said the Chinese company persuaded a long-time Dais employee to defect with trade secrets. "They just stole it, and they are using it against us," he said. Tangredi said he hopes the threat of a trade war will force China to rethink its practices: "You've got to do something to get their attention."
Ethiopia's government has fired five prison officials as it confronts allegations of torture and other abuses of inmates as part of a wave of reforms. Among those fired is the federal prison chief who until recently defended the treatment of inmates as "fair." The firings came ahead of a new Human Rights Watch report released Thursday that documents widespread arbitrary detention, torture, rape and humiliation over several years in Ethiopia's eastern Somali region. It urges new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to investigate the "horrific" situation. Abiy has admitted that security forces have tortured people but has yet to "tackle Ethiopia's culture of impunity and ensure accountability," said Felix Horne, senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch.
(Reuters) - A man went on a stabbing spree at a 3-year-old’s birthday party at an apartment complex housing refugee families in Boise on Saturday, injuring nine people, including six children, police said on Sunday. Timmy Kinner, a 30-year-old from Los Angeles who had been staying at the complex, has been arrested, Boise police said. He is not an immigrant and went on the rampage a day after being asked to leave by one of the residents, police said. Kinner was being held without bail at the Ada County jail on 15 charges, including six of injury to a child and nine of aggravated battery, jail records showed. There was no lawyer listed for Kinner in the records.

In the survey, most say they are proud to be Americans, although Republicans feel that way more strongly (90 percent) than Democrats (61 percent). There is no consensus when asked about the country’s current course, though: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. “Overwhelming majorities of those in both parties and independents agree that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.”” USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll

Abbott said on Tuesday night he never conceived of climate change as a moral challenge. “It was an issue, that’s all, and – at least on the actual changes we’ve so far seen – not a very significant one compared to man’s inhumanity to man; maintaining and improving living standards; and even to many other environmental issues such as degraded bush and waterways, particulate pollution, water quality in the third world, deforestation and urban overcrowding.”
He contended that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide from roughly 300 to 400 parts per million over the last century had not triggered “dramatic consequences”. Play Video 0:32 Andrew Probyn calls Tony Abbott 'destructive' in ABC report – video
“Storms are not more severe; droughts are not more prolonged; floods are not greater; and fires are not more intense than a century ago – despite hyperventilating reportage and over-the-top claims from Green politicians,” he said. “Sea levels have hardly risen and temperatures are still below those of the medieval warm period. Over time, temperature change seems to correlate rather more with sun spot activity than with carbon dioxide levels.

That's more than all but three Democratic senators (Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana), all of whom are from red states and facing re-election this fall. "I think he's terrific," Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., who also faces a tough re-election fight, said in an interview. "It's harder work when you're not interested in voting the party line. You've got to look at every issue from all sides." "I really have been pleasantly surprised how willing he is to tell Chuck Schumer to go fly a kite," she added, referring to the Senate minority leader.
You can’t push any group of people that hard, that fast and for that long and expect them to maintain their composure.”
Eric Young, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees’ Council of Prison Locals, now prays before he looks at his phone every morning, worried he’ll receive a message from BOP’s director notifying him of a staff death. Young estimates that around two-thirds of his union members were Trump supporters. That makes sense: It’s a law enforcement agency that leans white and male (72 percent male, 62 percent white), and many federal prisons are in rural parts of the country, which Trump dominated. But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau. BOP has long suffered the kind of problems you’d expect for a massive bureaucracy centered on caging tens of thousands of people.
Pentagon Questioned Over Blackout On War Zone Troop Numbers
Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images
For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
The proposal would:
Legalize the possession and sale of up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana for personal, recreational use for people over the age of 21. A person could keep up to 10 ounces of marijuana at home. Tax marijuana sales with a 10 percent excise tax at the retail level as well as the state's 6 percent sales tax. Split those revenues, with 35 percent going to K-12 education, 35 percent to roads, 15 percent to the communities that allow marijuana businesses in their communities and 15 percent to counties where marijuana business are located. Allow communities to decide whether they’ll allow marijuana businesses in their towns.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.

Trump hailed the construction of a plant he said would be "the 8th wonder of the world" as an endorsement of his policies. "We have a lot of things going in the United States," he said. But not far is the headquarters of one of the first American casualties of Trump's trade war -- Harley-Davidson. The legendary motorcycle maker says it's having to move more manufacturing overseas as a result of retaliatory EU tariffs, a decision that surprised Trump. "I've done so much for you, and then this," the president tweeted.
Harley-Davidson responded by saying it would shift production of motorbikes for the EU market out of the US. A different president might have seen this as a warning of the collateral damage likely to be caused to the US economy from a trade war, but not this one. In phase two, Trump says he will target $200bn of Chinese goods and is threatening to put a 20% duty on automotive imports from Europe. Both will inevitably provoke tit-for-tat retaliation. The White House has already signalled what phase three of the programme will involve: new investment restrictions on Chinese firms in an attempt to stop intellectual property theft; and the US leaving the World Trade Organisation on the grounds that the Geneva-based body was designed by the rest of the world to screw America.
Even Pruitt’s own staff had begun to sour on him, with many worrying that their future career prospects would be damaged by their association with Pruitt’s tenure. Each scandal seemed more damning than the last. Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.

Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. Federal prosecutors on Tuesday publicly debunked conspiracy theories pushed by President Donald Trump and right-wing media that a former Democratic aide charged with bank fraud was actually a foreign spy trying to steal government secrets. In a plea deal with Imran Awan, who worked as an information technology aide for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., and other Democratic lawmakers, prosecutors said they had conducted "a thorough investigation" into claims that Awan stole information from government servers on behalf of another country while working for House Democrats, but reported that they found no evidence to support the conspiracy theories. "The Government agrees that the public allegations that (Awan) stole U.S. House of Representatives equipment and engaged in unauthorized or illegal conduct involving House computer systems do not form the basis of any conduct relevant to the determination of the sentence in this case," prosecutors said.
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A woman who scaled the Statue of Liberty’s stone pedestal was snatched by police officers and lowered to safety on Wednesday, ending a standoff that led to the evacuation of the New York Harbor landmark on Independence Day. Authorities could not confirm whether the woman was part of a group of protesters who had earlier unfurled a banner that read “Abolish ICE” from the base of the statue in a protest against U.S. immigration policy. Television images showed two helmeted officers, outfitted in harnesses and ropes, slowly approaching the woman and grabbing her as she clung to the sloping side of the giant statue near its upturned right foot. Minutes before, she had removed her pink athletic shoes and attempted unsuccessfully to scale Lady Liberty’s green-tarnished robes as the dark waters of the Hudson River swirled below. “She’s been taken into custody amicably, peacefully without any injuries, or injuries to our officers, thank God.
Three of the teens were named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit. Howard told U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Dillon during a status conference Tuesday that all three original plaintiffs are no longer part of the case. But he said another teen "is anxious to participate in the case" and will be named as a new plaintiff. "We believe that his allegations with respect to his experience at the facility are sufficiently analogous ... to those of John Does Nos. 1, 2 and 3," Howard said.

Freshman Rep. Moira Jayne Walsh, 27, who has been outspoken about what she sees as a culture of corruption in the State House, lost her party's endorsement to Michael Earnheart, who voted for President Donald Trump. As a safe blue state, Rhode Island rarely gets any national political attention. But Walsh woke up Tuesday to donations from as far away as Texas and California. Party officials describe Earnheart as a "lifelong Democrat" who voted for Trump because he didn’t like Hillary Clinton.
"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.

Trump’s campaign to limit legal and illegal immigration is driving up wages and salaries for Americans in various locations and careers around the country. The beneficiaries include new employees, African-American bakers in Chicago, Latino restaurant workers in Monterey, Calif., disabled people nationwide, high schoolers, resort workers in Hilton Head, construction workers, Superbowl workers, the garment industry, and workers at small businesses, and even Warren Buffett’s railroad workers. Amnesty advocates rely on business-funded “Nation of Immigrants” push-polls to show apparent voter support for immigration and immigrants. But “choice” polls reveal most voters’ often-ignored preference that CEOs should hire Americans at decent wages before hiring migrants.
President Trump has just said in the past week he's going to raise things like Syria, like Ukraine, like the election meddling issue, really the whole range of issues between us. And I think that, in the president's mind, this is very important, because it gives him an opportunity to size up Vladimir Putin, to see where there are areas where we might make progress together and where there are areas where we may not. BRENNAN: Well, right now, Russia is blanket-bombing Southern Syria. That violates the last agreement Vladimir Putin made with President Trump. Why would he believe that he's in any way trustworthy?
Many Americans gaze at the sky and see only a vast uncharted frontier for exploration. But President Donald Trump reminds Americans that there’s another potential reality in space: It could become a military battlefield, a place where this nation’s independence is protected or lost. The point isn’t to repel an alien invasion from deep space. We’re not worried about Klingons. But Americans do have reason to be concerned about technologically advancing adversaries here on Earth.
Fox News again dominated for the second quarter of 2018 not only in cable news, but in all of cable, while CNN landed in last place by a country mile. For the eighth straight quarter, Fox was the most-watched network in all of cable. With an average of 1.409 million total day viewers, Fox attracted nearly as many eyeballs as MSNBC and CNN combined. MSNBC averaged just 930,000 viewers, while CNN nosedived with an average of just 658,000. During primetime, Fox snagged an average of 2.447 million viewers, compared to MSNBC’s 1.736 million.
The vast majority of swing voters across the United States oppose the Democrats’ latest plan to abolish all immigration enforcement by ending the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. In recent weeks, Democrats in the House and Senate, along with progressive liberals like Cynthia Nixon in New York and most recently insurgent Democrat candidate for Congress, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have been demanding ICE be abolished and all immigration enforcement be ended. House Democrats are now crafting legislation that would officially abolish ICE. The latest Harvard/Harris Poll, though, reveals that swing voters are overwhelmingly opposed to the Democrats’ plan to end all immigration enforcement across the U.S.
Nearly 3-in-4 swing voters, about 73 percent, of swing voters said they do not want ICE to be disbanded. Less than 30 percent of swing voters said they support the abolishment of ICE.
They include the United States withdrawing its 28,500 troops in South Korea, ending its military drills with South Korea and stop bringing in strategic assets such as aircraft carriers and nuclear-capable bombers. North Korea hasn't repeated such specific demands since entering disarmament talks earlier this year, raising optimism that the country truly appeared to seek to improve ties with the United States. After the summit, Trump suspended annual military training with South Korea that the North has called an invasion rehearsal. But North Korea still prefers a step-by-step disarmament process with reciprocal concessions and benefits from the United States for each of the North's denuclearization steps. The ultimate rewards North Korea wants range from the easing or lifting of American-led international sanctions, the signing of a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, the establishment of diplomatic ties and the pulling out of U.S. troops in South Korea, experts say.
NEW YORK — House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) has referred 15 individuals, including longtime Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal, for possible “open setting” testimony in the ongoing Russia investigation. The list was sent to House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA). Many of the names are tied to the discredited anti-Trump dossier produced by the controversial Fusion GPS firm, which was paid for its dossier work by both Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) via the Perkins Coie lawfirm. Indeed, Perkins Coie attorney Marc E. Elias, who reportedly was involved in arranging the payments that resulted in the dossier, made the Nunes list. As did Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson.

The latest high-level departure from President Donald Trump's Cabinet was not the most unexpected departure that has faced the administration. Scott Pruitt, the administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency, came under fire multiple times during his tenure over questionable finances, including both excessive spending and sweetheart deals that helped him spend less than expected. Here's a review of his time in office. Dec. 7, 2016: Trump announces that Pruitt will be his nominee for EPA administrator
The then-Attorney General of Oklahoma was touted by Trump as having "great qualifications and a good record." Part of that record was Pruitt touting himself as a "leading advocate against the EPA's activist agenda," and his history of challenging the EPA was well known.

The Republican senator, a supporter of abortion rights, said Roe v. Wade is settled law that has been established as a constitutional right. "A candidate who would overturn Roe would not be acceptable," she said. Collins added that she urged the president to expand the list of people he is considering for the high court beyond his initial 25 names.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
In the lead-up to the upcoming NATO summit in Brussels, President Donald Trump has reportedly sent “sharply worded letters” to the leaders of several NATO allies, escalating his long-simmering feud with the military alliance. The New York Times reported Monday that the letters, sent last month to leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Prime Minister Charles Michel of Belgium, rebuked NATO allies for not spending enough on their own defense ― a criticism that Trump has repeatedly leveled against other alliance members. The president also suggested in the letters that the U.S. would consider reducing its military commitment globally if its allies don’t ramp up spending, reported the Times. In his letter to Merkel, Trump reportedly wrote: “There is growing frustration in the United States that some allies have not stepped up as promised. The United States continues to devote more resources to the defense of Europe when the Continent’s economy, including Germany’s, are doing well and security challenges abound.

President Donald Trump is not responsible for the killing of journalists in Annapolis last week. His belittling of the press — his “enemy of the American people” taunts, his promises to roll back libel laws, his fomenting rage toward specific journalists at rallies — is worth mentioning within the context of the murders, because it speaks to a larger concern that last Thursday’s attack on The Capital Gazette won’t be an isolated incident. Journalists, many of whom already risk their lives covering war and violence, many of whom receive death threats regularly, feel understandable jitters about a leader who tries to turn the American public against us, particularly when we watch a member of that public shoot up a newsroom and end five lives. It’s reckless and inaccurate, though, to pin the shootings on Trump. The suspect swore an oath to kill a Capital writer who wrote about him in 2011.

But John Bercow used the 70th anniversary of the NHS to heap praise on its founder, Aneurin Bevan. The Speaker hosted a reception to mark the occasion. John Bercow cut his political teeth on the right of the Conservative party; Bevan was on the left of Labour.
Full-service restaurants with more elaborate menus and more complex processes, like the Red Hen and those in The Trump Organization properties, are more vulnerable to violations than fast-food eateries with limited food offerings and a streamlined kitchen production line, said Craig Hedberg, a professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Minnesota. And those with repeated violations can get into even more trouble with their local health departments, said Hedberg. Those eateries will be flagged by inspectors, who bring copies of previous reports on their visits and can spot patterns of regulation flouting. How repeat offenses are handled differs by jurisdiction. “It’s very rare to see a perfect score,” he said.
Nearly 600 more retail jobs are to go in the UK as the Jacques Vert, Windsmoor and Precis department store brands are wound down by administrators. Administrators said they had failed to find a buyer for Calvetron Brands, which had been restructured following a rescue deal last summer. The business entered administration in May and had already shed more than 400 jobs before Wednesday’s announcement. The latest retail job losses come as more than 30,000 jobs are at risk in the UK following mass closure announcements by major chains including House of Fraser, New Look and Marks & Spencer. Retailers are suffering from rising costs and the switch to online shopping just as hard-pressed consumers rein in spending.
The court documents detail the accounts of four unnamed women, identified as Jane Does 1, 2, 3, and 4. Local reports cited depositions that Large took before his death wherein he reportedly admitted to suggesting some of the women participate in "catfight videos" for money, but he denied the claims of sexual assault. Now his five of his former supervisors, police department, and Horry County officials are facing claims from two of the victims, Jane Does 3 and 4, for allegedly failing to prevent years of egregious abuse. Large died in January, 16 months after he was indicted. On Monday, a judge rejected a motion for summary judgment from the defendants and decided the case would move forward with a trial against the Horry County Police Department and Horry County.

Nebraska May Join Utah, Idaho in Putting Medicaid Expansion Before Voters
Enlarge this image toggle caption Fred Knapp/NET News Fred Knapp/NET News
Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.
"We don't underestimate the impact that the deaths of these young people will be having in the community and we would ask that people focus on supporting each other and supporting the police investigation."
Watts was transported to a nearby hospital, where 85 to 90 percent of his body was found to have been burned, Georgia State Patrol told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Authorities said Watts, upset with the federal agency designated to aid veterans, attached a homemade incendiary device and fireworks to his body before pouring liquid on himself. He then ignited the fluid. VETERAN PROTESTING TREATMENT BY VA SETS HIMSELF ON FIRE NEAR GEORGIA STATE CAPITOL, POLICE SAY
"It looks like a veteran that was disgruntled with the VA did a personal protest in front of the Capitol which involved gasoline and some fireworks,” Commissioner Mark McDonough, of the Georgia Department of Public Safety, said. The commissioner added a Capitol trooper "actually put him out with his fire extinguisher."
Even Pruitt’s own staff had begun to sour on him, with many worrying that their future career prospects would be damaged by their association with Pruitt’s tenure. Each scandal seemed more damning than the last. Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.
Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.
The list of Democrats expressing frustration with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has been growing longer in recent weeks, but don’t expect to see former President Barack Obama’s name on it. At a party fundraising event Friday afternoon in Northern California, Obama spoke highly of Pelosi – and even predicted that she will return to the job of House speaker after November’s midterm elections. “I think everybody knows how much I love Nancy Pelosi,” Obama told the gathering at a home in affluent Atherton, Politico reported. "Nancy, I believe, is one of the greatest speakers we ever had, and will once again be one of the greatest speakers we ever have after we get through this cycle," he continued. “And there's not much I could have gotten done without having Nancy there alongside of me every step of the way.”

The Mental Health Act needs to be updated because too many people are being detained in hospital and doctors are becoming increasingly risk-averse, the president of the supreme court has said. In a speech to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, Lady Hale acknowledged that judges themselves may have contributed to a “culture of blame, shame and fear.”
Last year the government set up an independent review of the Mental Health Act owing to concerns about rising rates of detention and the disproportionately large number of people from minority ethnic backgrounds who are sectioned. Hale said many people were not receiving sufficient care in the community to prevent them from reaching crisis point and there was confusion about legal overlaps with the Mental Capacity Act. Over the last 10 years, detentions in England have risen by 47% – from 43,000 in 2005/6 to 63,500 in 2015/16,” she said.
"We have made tremendous progress and the future of the EPA is very bright!" In his resignation letter to Trump, Pruitt said: "It is extremely difficult for me to cease serving you in this role first because I count it a blessing to be serving you in any capacity, but also, because of the transformative work that is occurring. "However, the unrelenting attacks on me personally [and] my family, are unprecedented and have taken a sizable toll on all of us," Pruitt added. Pruitt resigned less than a week after The New York Times reported that the EPA's chief ethics official, Kevin Minoli, had been pushing for a series of independent investigation into several aspects of Pruitt's tenure. Those include Pruitt's rental of a Washington D.C. condominium for $50 per day from the spouse of a prominent fossil fuel lobbyist and his alleged use of staff to handle personal matters.
Practice is only one of Deborah Glass’s 125 recommendations not accepted by Victorian government
Female prisoners in Victoria are still subject to “abusive” routine strip searches, a state government watchdog says. The Victorian ombudsman, Deborah Glass, said the government has failed to adopt a recommendation from her 2015 report into the prison system that called for an end to the searches. “Why has the government not accepted my recommendation to stop the abusive practice of routinely strip-searching women prisoners – in fact, the only recommendation out of 125 not accepted?” she asked on Wednesday. The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year.
Tory differences over UK's post-Brexit future spill into the open Read more
The Labour leader has said the result of the 2016 vote should be respected, but his frontbenchers have been careful not to explicitly rule out a second referendum if the circumstances change. Earlier in the day, Len McCluskey, Unite’s general secretary, said May’s government had lost all authority or capacity to make decisions. “We are not, I repeat for my friends in the media, not, calling for a second referendum … But we remain open to the possibility of a vote on any deal the Tories come back with,” he said. “These people see in Brexit the chance to turn Britain into the low-wage, deregulated, race-to-the-bottom society of their dreams. But Brexit is turning into a nightmare for the rest of us – a nightmare of uncertainty above all.
The use of robots to commune with people with Alzheimer’s opens up a whole box of moral quandaries, not least the prospect of some cognitive threshold beneath which patients will be pushed into the arms of machines, rather than humans. It is worth remembering too that like the digital “assistants” now entering people’s homes, Pepper and the current robo-carers do not offer anything approaching the nuances and complexities of genuine human interchange, rather an app store version that most people would consider a matter of erratic entertainment rather than a day-do-day necessity. But as and when robots manage to convincingly perform as make-believe humans, what then? Paradoxically, key voices in the tech world have long believed that as automation sweeps through large swathes of the economy, with the right fiscal adjustments, it will increase the numbers of human caregivers, and elevate them above the low-paid parts of the labour market where such roles are currently concentrated. Last year, for example, a writer in Wired magazine said that such roles as “companions to the elderly, home health aides, babysitters, special-needs aides, and more” demanded to be taken more seriously, and that “the riches resulting from increased automation … could be used to help fund caregiving programs”.

One participant said she didn't know, so the moderator asked for a show of hands. Few of them went up in the air. Fallon, who runs Demand Justice, said women in that focus group got more motivated once they understood that Kennedy was considered the high court's swing vote on abortion rights. Chris Kang, the chief counsel for Demand Justice, helped President Obama usher his Supreme Court picks through the Senate. He said Democrats tend to operate in issue silos, with people organizing around reproductive rights or issues related to lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender peoples' rights.
It is Trump’s responsibility, however, to help the nation heal in the aftermath. So it’s important that he reversed course Tuesday and called for the lowering of American flags in honor of the five victims. Trump initially rebuffed Annapolis Mayor Gavin Buckley’s request over the weekend to lower flags to half-staff. READ MORE: In a time of hate, your civility lectures aren't helping anyone »
“Obviously, I’m disappointed, you know?” Buckley told the Capital Gazette on Monday.
In some offices, dictation is automated into reports through voice recognition software, but this is an imperfect practice and often requires additional double-checking by a real human. Something that seems like a minor error — a misspelling, for example — can have consequences if that record is ever pulled as part of a malpractice suit. It can also mislead a future provider, influence how the office’s service is coded and therefore billed, or even confuse or mislead the patient when he or she is reviewing records. Doctors are human too, and they often dictate late at night after long shifts. Mistakes they didn’t make during a surgery can occur in the retelling of it.

Freshman Rep. Moira Jayne Walsh, 27, who has been outspoken about what she sees as a culture of corruption in the State House, lost her party's endorsement to Michael Earnheart, who voted for President Donald Trump. As a safe blue state, Rhode Island rarely gets any national political attention. But Walsh woke up Tuesday to donations from as far away as Texas and California. Party officials describe Earnheart as a "lifelong Democrat" who voted for Trump because he didn’t like Hillary Clinton.
But critics say it also underscores how his "America First" foreign policy at times can seem outright reckless, providing ammunition to America's adversaries. The White House declined to comment on the private conversations. But a National Security Council spokesman reiterated that the U.S. will consider all options at its disposal to help restore Venezuela's democracy and bring stability. Under Trump's leadership, the U.S., Canada and European Union have levied sanctions on dozens of top Venezuelan officials, including Maduro himself, over allegations of corruption, drug trafficking and human rights abuses. The U.S. has also distributed more than $30 million to help Venezuela's neighbors absorb an influx of more than 1 million migrants who have fled the country.
Abbott said on Tuesday night he never conceived of climate change as a moral challenge. “It was an issue, that’s all, and – at least on the actual changes we’ve so far seen – not a very significant one compared to man’s inhumanity to man; maintaining and improving living standards; and even to many other environmental issues such as degraded bush and waterways, particulate pollution, water quality in the third world, deforestation and urban overcrowding.”
He contended that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide from roughly 300 to 400 parts per million over the last century had not triggered “dramatic consequences”. Play Video 0:32 Andrew Probyn calls Tony Abbott 'destructive' in ABC report – video
“Storms are not more severe; droughts are not more prolonged; floods are not greater; and fires are not more intense than a century ago – despite hyperventilating reportage and over-the-top claims from Green politicians,” he said. “Sea levels have hardly risen and temperatures are still below those of the medieval warm period. Over time, temperature change seems to correlate rather more with sun spot activity than with carbon dioxide levels.
He said contracts obtained under energy reforms passed under President Enrique Pena Nieto will be scrutinized for any corruption or illegality, but otherwise contracts will be honored. "There will be no confiscation or expropriation of assets. ... Eradicating corruption will be the principal mission," he said. Lopez Obrador also spoke of reducing Mexican immigration to the United States through economic development. "Mexicans will be able ... to work and be happy where they were born," he said.
Hill denied the allegations in an emailed statement to IndyStar. Details of the accusations are outlined in a confidential June 18 memorandum prepared by the Taft Stettinius & Hollister law firm at the request of legislative leaders. The eight-page memo summarizes interviews that House and Senate leaders or their legal counsel conducted with six women who attended the end-of-session party at AJ’s Lounge, a bar just south of Downtown, during the early morning hours of March 15.

PORTLAND, Ore. -- Two opposing protest groups -- Patriot Prayer and antifa -- clashed in downtown Portland Saturday, CBS Portland affiliate KOIN reports. Portland police said failure to leave the area could leave to arrests, calling the demonstration a riot. More than 100 members of Patriot Prayer group gathered at Terry Schrunk Plaza for a "freedom rally," while more than 100 counter protesters with an antifa group gathered across the street at Chapman Square for rallies before a march. Police revoked Patriot Prayer's permit for the rally after the two groups began to clash. People were lighting firecrackers and smoke bombs in the crowd while police used flash bangs in an effort to disperse the clashing protesters.

"I don't understand none of this, sir," Kinner said. The AP reports that Kinner had recently stayed at the low-income apartment complex where the stabbing occurred, but had been asked to leave Friday over "bad behavior." The news agency writes, "Kinner is American, and the victims are members of refugee families from Syria, Iraq and Ethiopia. Boise Police Chief William Bones said the evidence does not suggest the attack was a hate crime." Speaking shortly after the assault on Saturday, Boise Police Chief William Bones said it was "a single evil individual who attacked people with no provocation that we are aware of."
A few days after Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., commented on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's upset victory, other established figures in the party voiced concerns that what worked locally may not translate as well nationally. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., added to the conversation on Sunday by suggesting that what worked in the Bronx for Ocasio-Cortez may not work nationwide. "I don't think you can go too far to the left and still win the Midwest," Duckworth said on CNN's "State of the Union." "Coming from a midwestern state, I think you need to be able to talk to the industrial Midwest. You need to be able to listen to the people there in order to win an election nationwide."

Because it is also a flood plain, the project’s 989,000 solar panels will be mounted on frames 12ft tall – the height of a double-decker bus. Unlike most solar farms, Cleve Hill Solar Park’s panels will not all face south, but east and west in a continuous zig-zag. The effect, say the scheme’s opponents, will be to turn green meadows into something resembling a colossal factory roof. Economically and environmentally the scheme makes no sense whatsoever. Apart from ruining a huge swathe of countryside and killing or displacing all the local wildlife, it will do little for Britain’s energy needs.
That may be less true in cases where U.S. companies engage in businesses with a ready substitute. Chinese leader Xi Jinping recently hinted that European and Asian conglomerates might soon find themselves benefiting as China punches back against the U.S.

In turn, that means American firms in China could soon find their new product models at the bottom of the regulatory pile for things like safety approvals, or their state-owned Chinese partners might shift resources toward European joint ventures instead.

It's a problem that's always there. "For a good few years we did see a decrease in the number of young people reportedly taking substances. "But over the last 12 to 18 months we have seen a slight increase."
Calls for an Iran without its current “dictatorial regime” were met with strengthened hope during the annual “free Iran” rally held in Paris this past weekend by the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), an exiled Paris-based Iranian opposition group allied with the Mujaheddin-e-Khalq (MEK). The rally, which event organizers said saw more than 100,000 attendees, took place at the Villepinte Congress Center, outside of Paris on Saturday. A series of panel discussions ranging in topic from women’s rights to denuclearization took place on Friday. The Guardian reported there was “a crowd of about 4,000, many of them refugees and young eastern Europeans who had been bussed in to attend the rally in return for a weekend trip to Paris.”
Distinguished speakers at Saturday’s event included former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal attorney; New Mexico’s former Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson; former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich; former Sen. Robert Torricelli (D-NJ); former FBI Director Louis Freeh; former Homeland Security Adviser Frances Townsend; and former U.S. Army chief of staff Gen. George Casey.
Just hours after his historic election victory sent thousands of supporters pouring on to the streets, the 64-year-old leftist tweeted that he had received a call from Donald Trump. “I proposed that we explore an integral agreement of development projects, which generate jobs in Mexico and with that reduce migration and improve security. There was respectful treatment and our representatives will speak more.”
In an interview with the Televisa news network, López Obrador emphasized the need for mutual respect and cooperation between the two neighbors. “We are conscious of the need to maintain good relations with the United States.

The Senate consists of 47 Democrats and two independents who represent more than half of the population, and 51 Republicans who represent less than half of the population. This obviously does not represent the will of the people. An institution created with the lofty responsibility of giving “advice and consent” has become an enabling tool to suppress democracy. Representatives of less than half of the population now have the power to impose their slanted view of the Constitution on the entire nation, for decades to come. This is who we are.

Even though he received what he called a “shellacking” in the 2010 midterms, and even though the GOP made unprecedented political gains during his tenure, President Obama was always convinced the country was behind him. As Mara Liasson wrote for NPR in 2016: “During Obama's eight years in office, the Democrats have lost more House, Senate, state legislative and governors seats than under any other president.” She noted that the Obama legacy includes “one huge failure: a diminished Democratic Party.”
In 2013, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., invoked the so-called “nuclear option,” discarding traditional filibuster protections for the minority party in favor of requiring only a simple majority to approve judicial and executive branch nominees. He carved out an exception for people put forward for the Supreme Court. The next year – with CNN describing President Obama as an “unpopular president limping through his second term” – Republicans reclaimed control of the Senate. As a result of that achievement, President Obama’s chances of securing a liberal majority on the high court all but disappeared.As Mara Liasson wrote for NPR in 2016: “During Obama's eight years in office, the Democrats have lost more House, Senate, state legislative and governors seats than under any other president.” She noted that the Obama legacy includes “one huge failure: a diminished Democratic Party.”

On this much police and activist South Side priest Michael Pfleger can agree: Saturday morning’s anti-violence march on the Dan Ryan Expressway is all about danger. Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.
Ethiopia's government has fired five prison officials as it confronts allegations of torture and other abuses of inmates as part of a wave of reforms. Among those fired is the federal prison chief who until recently defended the treatment of inmates as "fair." The firings came ahead of a new Human Rights Watch report released Thursday that documents widespread arbitrary detention, torture, rape and humiliation over several years in Ethiopia's eastern Somali region. It urges new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to investigate the "horrific" situation. Abiy has admitted that security forces have tortured people but has yet to "tackle Ethiopia's culture of impunity and ensure accountability," said Felix Horne, senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch.
“I was defending myself,” Sumpter said during the hearing. Judge John Blawie told Sumpter that he believed his version of events, but had to follow the letter of the law. Under Connecticut law, assault victims cannot use deadly force if they are able to retreat from their attackers. By contrast, 27 states — most notably Florida — have passed so-called “stand-your-ground” laws, which entitle citizens to use force in self-defense if there is a reasonable belief of a threat.

But some people thought the photo looked like they were kissing on the lips - and a backlash followed, led by far-right online users who accused her of getting too friendly with foreigners. "'I'll cut out your uterus' they wrote to me. They even attached two pictures of a weapon that looked like a dagger," says Maria. The abusive messages poured in all night long and she became scared.

Demand down 3.5% but sales of petrol models rose by 12.3% last month
UK sales of new cars fell in June as drivers shun diesels
Demand for new cars fell by 3.5% in June, ending a short-lived recovery in the UK automotive market. Registrations are down 6.3% this year compared with the first six months of 2017. Tata Motors shares hit five-year low after hard Brexit warning - business live Read more
Almost 235,000 new cars were registered last month compared with just over 243,000 during the same month last year, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said. This brought two months of sales increases to an end. Sales of petrol models rose by 12.3% last month, while diesels fell for the 15th consecutive month, down 28.2%.
This is just terrible timing all around." Medicaid, an $11 billion, state-federal health plan in Kentucky, covers 1.4 million people, about 600,000 of them children. The federal government provides about 80 percent of the state's Medicaid funds. The cuts to dental and vision benefits were supposed to affect only able-bodied adults, mostly those added to Medicaid under an expansion authorized through the Affordable Care Act.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
Even though he received what he called a “shellacking” in the 2010 midterms, and even though the GOP made unprecedented political gains during his tenure, President Obama was always convinced the country was behind him. As Mara Liasson wrote for NPR in 2016: “During Obama's eight years in office, the Democrats have lost more House, Senate, state legislative and governors seats than under any other president.” She noted that the Obama legacy includes “one huge failure: a diminished Democratic Party.”
In 2013, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., invoked the so-called “nuclear option,” discarding traditional filibuster protections for the minority party in favor of requiring only a simple majority to approve judicial and executive branch nominees. He carved out an exception for people put forward for the Supreme Court. The next year – with CNN describing President Obama as an “unpopular president limping through his second term” – Republicans reclaimed control of the Senate. As a result of that achievement, President Obama’s chances of securing a liberal majority on the high court all but disappeared.
His precise motive is unclear. This attack is "not a symbol or a representation of our community in Boise, but it's a single evil individual who attacked people with no provocation that we are aware of," Bones said. Kinner is being questioned by authorities. He has been booked into jail on nine counts of aggravated battery and six counts of injury to a child. The police found victims of the attack both within apartments and in the complex's parking lot.
That came on the heels of 0.9 percent drop in March, the first monthly drop since July of 2017. Total private construction rose 0.3 percent, with residential projects up 0.8 percent in May. New single-family home construction rose 0.6 percent and the volatile apartment building sector jumped 1.6 percent. Private, non-residential building fell 0.3 percent. Economists are forecasting that construction spending will contribute to overall growth this year even though interest rates are rising.

June’s U.S. unemployment data, due Friday, will be closely-watched for further signs of a tightening labour market. Unemployment data for May boosted markets, with the rate falling to an 18-year low, pointing to strength in the U.S. economy, and helping send stocks up around 1 percent that day. Nonfarm payrolls surged by 223,000 jobs during that month as warm weather bolstered hiring at construction sites. June’s data is expected to show a 200,000 increase, according to a Reuters poll.
Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.
Those lawyers have shown boundless creativity in reinterpreting the constitution. Getting past them is a daunting task. Still, Emanuel was worried enough to get his stooges on the City Council to try to block Quinn’s measure. Last week, they hustled through three advisory referenda — throwaway questions whose true purpose is to crowd anything meaningful off the ballot. State law says only three such measures can appear on the ballot.
Hamilton, the Republican state lawmaker who beat the incumbent Karnes, won with a mix of support from teachers and other unions. While Karnes sparred with teachers during the strike, Hamilton took a moderate position. He aligned with teachers unions by opposing state right-to-work legislation and the proposed repeal of prevailing wage laws for public construction projects. The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.
The liberal high school teacher ousted a 24-year incumbent who served as House majority leader in 2016. Now, the state party has endorsed a professor at a Catholic University who signed a letter supporting Ireland's abortion ban, which was recently overturned. "Quite frankly, they are not used to women of color, black women, standing up," Ranglin-Vassell said. Democratic state Rep. Teresa Tanzi, standing, talks with Democratic Rep.

Corporate America couldn’t hire Republican lobbyists fast enough after President Donald Trump’s election gave the GOP unified control of Washington. Now there are signs that Democrats are back in demand. Companies and trade groups are trying to hire congressional staffers with ties to influential House Democrats four months ahead of the midterm elections, in which Democrats are expected to pick up seats and potentially retake control of the House. Lobbyists are helping their clients meet with the Democrats who would become committee chairs if the party does win back the chamber. And trade groups are talking to members about what to expect from a Democratic takeover.
But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said. Tackett said he's concerned about children, especially in Eastern Kentucky, which has a higher rate of Medicaid patients and some of the state's worst oral health. "I have no problem with them regulating the adults that are on Medicaid," Tackett said. "If they are young and healthy, they should be out working or doing something.
'We’re going to run different'
His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
U.S. Treasuries and German Bund both saw buying while E-Mini futures for Wall Street’s S&P 500 ESc1 followed Europe and Asia’s lead with a loss of 0.5 percent. Shanghai blue chips .CSI300 had resumed their slide with a fall of 2.9 percent that soured sentiment across the region. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS fell 0.6 percent, adding to a 2 percent drop last week. Japan's Nikkei .N225 shed 2.2 percent to an 11-week low, with a survey of manufacturers showing sentiment had darkened a shade in the face of trade war threats. The purchasing managers’ index (PMI) still edged higher for June, but exports orders softened.
It has also been shared by a Facebook user with the comment: "Did not know sniffing was a thing in schools now!" Claire Robinson, from Newcastle-based drugs charity Positive Response to Overcoming Problems of Substance misuse (Props), said: "Drug use is something we find in almost all of our secondary schools and colleges. It's a problem that's always there. "For a good few years we did see a decrease in the number of young people reportedly taking substances. "But over the last 12 to 18 months we have seen a slight increase."
"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.
— MINING: The EPA said last year that it won't require mining companies to prove they have the financial resources to clean up pollution, an Obama-era rule stemming from a long history of pollution spilling from abandoned mines into streams. Pruitt said modern mining practices and existing regulations made the financial requirement unnecessary and a burden on mining. — AUTOS: Pruitt's EPA has proposed freezing vehicle fuel-efficiency standards at 2020 levels for the next five years, according to a draft of the proposal obtained by Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del. For new vehicles, that means an average of about 30 miles per gallon instead of rising to 36 mpg by 2025 as Obama's EPA proposed. — OIL AND GAS: More than a dozen states are suing the EPA for failing to take action against leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, from oil and natural gas wells.
Bishop John Bauerschmidt, who oversees the Middle Tennessee region of the church, stands firmly by his decision not to authorize their use, nor allow clergy within his diocese to officiate the religious ceremonies or permit the weddings on church property. In doing so, the bishop says he is being faithful to his job of guarding the discipline, faith and unity of the church. April 2017: Black female Episcopal bishop of Indy diocese breaks stained glass ceiling
January 2016: Anglicans suspend Episcopal Church over stance on same-sex marriage

"The teaching that Christian marriage is between a man and a woman is reasonable, traditional, and scriptural," Bauerschmidt said in an email. "There really is nothing remarkable about a Christian bishop who holds to this teaching." While Bishops can place limitations on the use of the marriage liturgies, they must refer couples to a willing diocese if they do not authorize them.
The problem is so pervasive that a lawmaker recently asked El Salvador's Legislative Assembly for national identity cards to be issued without addresses "to save lives." Fifteen years ago, the Salvadoran government began a crackdown on gangs, resulting in thousands of members being imprisoned. Yet they continued to proliferate, even running operations with cell phones from behind bars. El Salvador's defense minister said in 2015 there were 60,000 gang members in the country, compared to a combined police and army strength of 50,000. Members of those security forces contribute to the violence that is causing the northward migration.
In one case, Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion that illegal immigrants do not have the same bargaining rights as American citizens and legal workers. “… an illegal immigrant worker is not an ’employee’ under the NLRA for the simple reason that, ever since 1986, an illegal immigrant worker is not a lawful ’employee’ in the United States,” Kavanaugh wrote. In another case, Kavanaugh noted that American multi-national corporations do not have the right to import foreign workers. The Circuit judge explained, “Under the provision of the immigration laws at issue here, mere economic expediency does not authorize an employer to displace American workers for foreign workers.”
Prominent conservative Ann Coulter has also called for Trump to nominate Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, arguing that other judges such as Thomas Hardiman and Raymond Kethledge “are open borders zealots.”

So those are the five senators who our attention is going to be really on for the next two months. BRENNAN: And what about immigration, Jan?

Kinner was being held without bail at the Ada County jail on 15 charges, including six of injury to a child and nine of aggravated battery, jail records showed. There was no lawyer listed for Kinner in the records. Kinner may have wanted to “extract vengeance” for being kicked out by a tenant who took him in, Police Chief Bill Bones said at a press conference on Sunday. The woman who took Kinner in was not harmed and was not at the residence at the time of the attack. Kinner assaulted the children at the party after he was unable to find the woman, police said, adding his motive was still under investigation.

Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.
And certainly Trump would deserve great credit for seeing the possibility of a peaceful solution where many of his advisers saw military action as the only option. In the meantime, we have much hard work ahead. It won’t be easy, and it won’t be quick. William J. Perry is a former secretary of defense.

It’s not strictly true to say everyone is against the three huge plant-forested glass spheres at what Amazon calls its “campus” in the heart of the city. The Bezos balls, as the conservatories are popularly known, are modelled on the greenhouses at London’s Kew Gardens, feature walkways above fig trees, ferns and rhododendrons, and provide hot-desking for Amazon workers looking for a break from the neighbouring office tower. There was nothing in that area 10 years ago,” said Jen Reed, selling jerky from another market stall. “I don’t hate Amazon the way that a lot of people hate them.

He was, in other words, beginning to sound more like his tweets, and perhaps just a bit like Donald Trump. Brennan’s father, Owen, was a blacksmith who immigrated to New Jersey from Ireland in 1948. Owen’s own father, Brennan told me, was “a supporter, an affiliate, say,” of the Irish Republican Army. Brennan moved twice while growing up, from one apartment to another before settling in a three-family house in North Bergen. His grandmother lived on the top floor.
Trump hailed the construction of a plant he said would be "the 8th wonder of the world" as an endorsement of his policies. "We have a lot of things going in the United States," he said. But not far is the headquarters of one of the first American casualties of Trump's trade war -- Harley-Davidson. The legendary motorcycle maker says it's having to move more manufacturing overseas as a result of retaliatory EU tariffs, a decision that surprised Trump. "I've done so much for you, and then this," the president tweeted.
Dec. 7, 2016: Trump announces that Pruitt will be his nominee for EPA administrator
The then-Attorney General of Oklahoma was touted by Trump as having "great qualifications and a good record." Part of that record was Pruitt touting himself as a "leading advocate against the EPA's activist agenda," and his history of challenging the EPA was well known. Feb. 17, 2017: Confirmed by the Senate
Pruitt's confirmation, which was approved with a vote of 52-46, came in the midst of a court order that required him to turn over thousands of communications with major coal, oil and gas companies from his time in office. Democratic senators expressed outrage that Republicans were going ahead as scheduled with the vote on Pruitt, despite the judge’s ruling in the order. March 23, 2017: Defends budget cuts to his agency
The budget plan put forward by the Trump administration proposed cuts 31 percent of the EPA’s funding, including significant reductions to research programs and enforcement of clean air and clean water programs, but that didn’t bother Pruitt.

Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
Pruitt resigned less than a week after The New York Times reported that the EPA's chief ethics official, Kevin Minoli, had been pushing for a series of independent investigation into several aspects of Pruitt's tenure. Those include Pruitt's rental of a Washington D.C. condominium for $50 per day from the spouse of a prominent fossil fuel lobbyist and his alleged use of staff to handle personal matters. In all, the Times reported, Pruitt is facing 13 federal inquiries into his spending and management practices. Earlier this month House Democrats asked the Justice Department to investigate Pruitt for potential criminal conduct, alleging that he repeatedly violated federal anti-corruption laws by seeking to leverage his government position for personal gain. They cited the condo arrangement as well as Pruitt directing an EPA aide to contact a senior Chick-fil-A executive as part of an effort to land his family a franchise, and a $2,000 payment to his wife from organizers of a conference Pruitt then attended at taxpayer expense.
The list of Democrats expressing frustration with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has been growing longer in recent weeks, but don’t expect to see former President Barack Obama’s name on it. At a party fundraising event Friday afternoon in Northern California, Obama spoke highly of Pelosi – and even predicted that she will return to the job of House speaker after November’s midterm elections. “I think everybody knows how much I love Nancy Pelosi,” Obama told the gathering at a home in affluent Atherton, Politico reported. "Nancy, I believe, is one of the greatest speakers we ever had, and will once again be one of the greatest speakers we ever have after we get through this cycle," he continued. “And there's not much I could have gotten done without having Nancy there alongside of me every step of the way.”

A Connecticut man who was assaulted by three juveniles while at work has been sentenced to prison for stabbing one of the attackers. The Connecticut Post reports 21-year-old Jeffrey Sumpter of Bridgeport received 18 months in jail Monday at a Stamford courthouse. The paper reported that Sumpter — who was convicted of felony first-degree assault — also will have to spend three years following his release on probation. If he breaks the law during that time, Sumpter could be made to serve all or part of a 42-month prison sentence. Sumpter was working at a Dunkin’ Donuts in Norwalk last October when he was jumped by three males.

Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.

The report says the combined value of metallurgical and thermal coal exports will be $60.2bn in 2017-18, behind iron ore at $61.8bn. It says coal exports will be slightly lower at $58.1bn in 2018-19, and that iron ore earnings will be even lower at $57.7bn, as falling iron ore prices drive export earnings lower. The Australian characterised that event as coal reclaiming its mantle as the nation’s “top export earner”. But the report says coal export earnings will soon drop below those for iron ore again, as global coal prices fall. India's huge solar ambitions could push coal further into shade Read more
In 2019-20 coal export earnings will be just $51.1bn, while iron ore earnings will be $55.4bn.
Tesla could use a lighter moment. It has had a 2018 filled with ups and downs. In May, Consumer Reports initially did not recommend the electric vehicle giant’s Model 3, its first car priced for mainstream buyers, in part because of long stopping distances, only to see the magazine relent after it flashed software to cars that improved them. Last month, Tesla topped a list of best-selling electric vehicles in the United States, selling three of the five most popular cars. And this week, Tesla announced that it had reached Musk's goal of manufacturing 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) spent a total of $4 billion on improper food stamp payments to those receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the USDA confirmed with Breitbart News on Friday. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service announced this week that improper payments made up 6.3 percent of SNAP money in the fiscal year (FY) 2017—the latest data available from the agency. Breitbart News analyzed the USDA’s data on food stamp spending and found that $4,007,026,532 of the $63,603,595,754 the agency spent on SNAP in FY 2017 went to improper payments. The USDA told Breitbart News that “it is important to note that improper payments include both overpayments and underpayments,” meaning that households on SNAP that received less than what they were supposed to receive for the month are also included in the percentage rate. Brandon Lipps, the Acting Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services at the agency, said that most improper payments are due to “human errors”—either because of state agencies miscalculating benefits or benefit recipients giving state agencies the wrong information.
Five children 15 and younger were among 23 people shot during a scorching weekend in Chicago. From Friday afternoon to early Monday, 21 people were wounded and two people were killed, including a 14-year-old boy who was shot early Saturday while walking in the Washington Park neighborhood, according to police. About nine hours earlier, another 14-year-old boy was shot in the Loop. He was coming up stairs at the corner of Wabash Avenue and Wacker Drive when he was shot in the leg Friday evening, police said. Late Sunday night, three girls ages 5, 14 and 15 were shot while sitting in a parked car with their mother in the East Garfield Park neighborhood, police said.
Trump has since ordered the separations be stopped, but it hasn't curbed calls on the left to "abolish ICE." Hundreds of thousands of marchers participated in more than 700 marches across the country over the weekend to protest the family separations. They gathered on the front lawn of a Border Patrol station in McAllen, Texas, near a detention center where migrant children were being held in cages, and on a street corner near Trump's golf resort at Bedminster, New Jersey, where the president was spending the weekend. Tweeting Saturday from New Jersey, Trump urged ICE agents to "not worry or lose your spirit" and wrote that "the radical left Dems want you out. Next it will be all police."

The report says the combined value of metallurgical and thermal coal exports will be $60.2bn in 2017-18, behind iron ore at $61.8bn. It says coal exports will be slightly lower at $58.1bn in 2018-19, and that iron ore earnings will be even lower at $57.7bn, as falling iron ore prices drive export earnings lower. The Australian characterised that event as coal reclaiming its mantle as the nation’s “top export earner”. But the report says coal export earnings will soon drop below those for iron ore again, as global coal prices fall. India's huge solar ambitions could push coal further into shade Read more
In 2019-20 coal export earnings will be just $51.1bn, while iron ore earnings will be $55.4bn.
Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.
In some offices, dictation is automated into reports through voice recognition software, but this is an imperfect practice and often requires additional double-checking by a real human. Something that seems like a minor error — a misspelling, for example — can have consequences if that record is ever pulled as part of a malpractice suit. It can also mislead a future provider, influence how the office’s service is coded and therefore billed, or even confuse or mislead the patient when he or she is reviewing records. Doctors are human too, and they often dictate late at night after long shifts. Mistakes they didn’t make during a surgery can occur in the retelling of it.

A lawmaker and three legislative staffers have accused Attorney General Curtis Hill of inappropriately touching them during a party on the final night of the legislative session, prompting an investigation by leaders of the Indiana General Assembly. Hill denied the allegations in an emailed statement to IndyStar. Details of the accusations are outlined in a confidential June 18 memorandum prepared by the Taft Stettinius & Hollister law firm at the request of legislative leaders.

Democratic activists say the “Abolish ICE” campaign is not intended to open the borders which are guarded by the Customs and Border Protection agency. Instead, the activists say they hope to block ICE from deporting the economic migrants or refugees who get across the border, and who are seeking jobs and apartments as well as schools for their children. But that no-deportations policy would allow many companies to hire illegals instead of Americans. That subsequent rush of migrants would force down wages for Americans and for legal immigrants, force up rents and housing prices, and also overcrowd public K-12 schools.
The problem is so pervasive that a lawmaker recently asked El Salvador's Legislative Assembly for national identity cards to be issued without addresses "to save lives." Fifteen years ago, the Salvadoran government began a crackdown on gangs, resulting in thousands of members being imprisoned. Yet they continued to proliferate, even running operations with cell phones from behind bars. El Salvador's defense minister said in 2015 there were 60,000 gang members in the country, compared to a combined police and army strength of 50,000. Members of those security forces contribute to the violence that is causing the northward migration.

Many Americans gaze at the sky and see only a vast uncharted frontier for exploration. But President Donald Trump reminds Americans that there’s another potential reality in space: It could become a military battlefield, a place where this nation’s independence is protected or lost. The point isn’t to repel an alien invasion from deep space. We’re not worried about Klingons. But Americans do have reason to be concerned about technologically advancing adversaries here on Earth.
And certainly Trump would deserve great credit for seeing the possibility of a peaceful solution where many of his advisers saw military action as the only option. In the meantime, we have much hard work ahead. It won’t be easy, and it won’t be quick. William J. Perry is a former secretary of defense.

Federal prosecutors on Tuesday publicly debunked conspiracy theories pushed by President Donald Trump and right-wing media that a former Democratic aide charged with bank fraud was actually a foreign spy trying to steal government secrets. In a plea deal with Imran Awan, who worked as an information technology aide for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., and other Democratic lawmakers, prosecutors said they had conducted "a thorough investigation" into claims that Awan stole information from government servers on behalf of another country while working for House Democrats, but reported that they found no evidence to support the conspiracy theories. "The Government agrees that the public allegations that (Awan) stole U.S. House of Representatives equipment and engaged in unauthorized or illegal conduct involving House computer systems do not form the basis of any conduct relevant to the determination of the sentence in this case," prosecutors said.

Rep. Jim Jordan Denies He Knew Of Decades-Long Sexual Abuse At Ohio State

Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, one of the most powerful conservatives in Congress, has denied reports that he ignored the alleged sexual abuse of athletes while he worked as an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University more than 20 years ago. Allegations that Jordan was aware of sexual misconduct and explicitly was informed of specific incidents of alleged assault by the wrestling team's doctor, first surfaced in an NBC news story on Tuesday. But Jordan — who was an assistant coach from 1987 until 1995, when he was elected to the state legislature — has refuted the claims. "Congressman Jordan never saw any abuse, never heard about any abuse, and never had any abuse reported to him during his time as a coach at Ohio State," Ian Fury, Jordan's spokesman, said in a statement. "He has not been contacted by investigators about the matter but will assist them in any way they ask, because if what is alleged is true, the victims deserve a full investigation and justice."
Just hours after his historic election victory sent thousands of supporters pouring on to the streets, the 64-year-old leftist tweeted that he had received a call from Donald Trump. “I proposed that we explore an integral agreement of development projects, which generate jobs in Mexico and with that reduce migration and improve security. There was respectful treatment and our representatives will speak more.”
In an interview with the Televisa news network, López Obrador emphasized the need for mutual respect and cooperation between the two neighbors. “We are conscious of the need to maintain good relations with the United States.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) spent a total of $4 billion on improper food stamp payments to those receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the USDA confirmed with Breitbart News on Friday. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service announced this week that improper payments made up 6.3 percent of SNAP money in the fiscal year (FY) 2017—the latest data available from the agency. Breitbart News analyzed the USDA’s data on food stamp spending and found that $4,007,026,532 of the $63,603,595,754 the agency spent on SNAP in FY 2017 went to improper payments. The USDA told Breitbart News that “it is important to note that improper payments include both overpayments and underpayments,” meaning that households on SNAP that received less than what they were supposed to receive for the month are also included in the percentage rate. Brandon Lipps, the Acting Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services at the agency, said that most improper payments are due to “human errors”—either because of state agencies miscalculating benefits or benefit recipients giving state agencies the wrong information.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report says Democrats are "likely" to carry Montana in the Senate race. Inside Elections rates the contest as one that "tilts Democratic." After the rally, the spokesman for Tester's re-election campaign put out a statement that was critical of Rosendale but which did not mention the president. "Jon's record is clear—if it's good for Montana, Jon works with anyone from either party to get things done. If it's bad for Montana, he'll stand up to anyone," Tester spokesman Chris Meagher said.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.

That subsequent rush of migrants would force down wages for Americans and for legal immigrants, force up rents and housing prices, and also overcrowd public K-12 schools.

Trump’s campaign to limit legal and illegal immigration is driving up wages and salaries for Americans in various locations and careers around the country. The beneficiaries include new employees, African-American bakers in Chicago, Latino restaurant workers in Monterey, Calif., disabled people nationwide, high schoolers, resort workers in Hilton Head, construction workers, Superbowl workers, the garment industry, and workers at small businesses, and even Warren Buffett’s railroad workers. Amnesty advocates rely on business-funded “Nation of Immigrants” push-polls to show apparent voter support for immigration and immigrants. But “choice” polls reveal most voters’ often-ignored preference that CEOs should hire Americans at decent wages before hiring migrants.
Full-service restaurants with more elaborate menus and more complex processes, like the Red Hen and those in The Trump Organization properties, are more vulnerable to violations than fast-food eateries with limited food offerings and a streamlined kitchen production line, said Craig Hedberg, a professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Minnesota. And those with repeated violations can get into even more trouble with their local health departments, said Hedberg. Those eateries will be flagged by inspectors, who bring copies of previous reports on their visits and can spot patterns of regulation flouting. How repeat offenses are handled differs by jurisdiction. “It’s very rare to see a perfect score,” he said.
"Jon's record is clear—if it's good for Montana, Jon works with anyone from either party to get things done. If it's bad for Montana, he'll stand up to anyone," Tester spokesman Chris Meagher said. "East Coast developer Matt Rosendale is only looking out for himself and whatever out-of-state special interest group that is propping up his campaign with cash. We can't trust him to defend Montana." But before Trump arrived in Montana, Tester's campaign took out full-page ads in newspapers across the state, highlighting bills the senator sponsored that Trump has signed into law.
In their statement, Mr Netanyahu and Mr Morawiecki praised the Polish wartime government-in-exile, saying it tried to "raise awareness among Western allies of the systematic murder" of Polish Jews. They also said structures of the Polish underground state supervised by the Polish government-in-exile "created a mechanism of systematic help and support to Jewish people". However Yad Vashem said this contradicted decades of historical research and contained "grave errors and deceptions". It said much of the Polish resistance in its various movements "not only failed to help Jews, but was also not infrequently actively involved in persecuting them". Polish assistance to Jews during the Holocaust was "relatively rare", Yad Vashem said, and "attacks against and even the murder of Jews were widespread".
They said there are over 300 German automotive facilities in the United States, supporting nearly 120,000 jobs.

They are even now talking about two other former Kennedy clerks for the Supreme Court, Judges Brett Kavanaugh and Ray Kethledge. And they've put a bunch of Kennedy clerks onto the lower courts. And they seem to exploit some connections between the Kennedy and Trump families. Justice Kennedy's son, Justin, had business dealings with President Trump. Ivanka Trump visited the Supreme Court at Justice Kennedy's invitation after the two of them met after the inauguration.
We look at other parts of the world, where women are not allowed to vote, or dance, and we see ourselves as modern and liberated. But all our “freedoms” are fairly recent, from being able to get a mortgage to being protected from rape in marriage. The narrative of progress is one that too many liberals imbibe, but it is untrue. In many of the areas to which we turn when we measure gender equality, we have not moved forward for the past 10 years – income, political engagement, education.
Corporate America couldn’t hire Republican lobbyists fast enough after President Donald Trump’s election gave the GOP unified control of Washington. Now there are signs that Democrats are back in demand. Companies and trade groups are trying to hire congressional staffers with ties to influential House Democrats four months ahead of the midterm elections, in which Democrats are expected to pick up seats and potentially retake control of the House. Lobbyists are helping their clients meet with the Democrats who would become committee chairs if the party does win back the chamber. And trade groups are talking to members about what to expect from a Democratic takeover.
A California city official sparked outrage this weekend after calling for July to be designated “Straight Pride American Month” in an essay that appeared in a local newspaper and on his personal website. The June 29 installment of Dixon Vice Mayor Ted Hickman’s column, “That’s Life,” contained a number of slurs against LGBTQ people and other eyebrow-raising language. Blasting June as “LGBTQF-WTF month,” Hickman suggested “Straight Pride American Month,” or “SPAM,” as a time for “healthy, heterosexual, fairly monogamous, keep our kinky stuff to ourselves Americans” to be celebrated nationwide. “Don’t get me wrong I support the First Amendment, as much as the next person, and support the rights of grown men to wear skin tight short-shorts and go-go boots and don tinker bell wings with wand and prance down the streets of San Francisco,” Hickman wrote. Ted Hickman should be ashamed for sharing such an awful message... Dixon, CA needs to do better.
Despite the ban, police allowed the organizers to read a press statement. “We do not recognize this ban,” the group said in the statement read out loud by a volunteer, calling the prohibition imposed by Istanbul’s governor “comical.”
Police told the crowd to disperse after the statement, warning “otherwise, we will intervene.” Officers patrolled with dogs and had water cannons stationed nearby. They fired tear gas on groups in some areas and were seen elsewhere pushing and shouting at participants who were too slow to scatter. March organizers said Friday that the governor had prohibited the march in violation of the right to freedom of assembly. The governor has cited security reasons and public “sensitivities” as grounds for barring LGBTI marches since 2015.

As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
According to a Russian state media report related by Turkey’s Hurriyet Daily News , the United States is planning to send next-generation B61 nuclear gravity bombs to NATO bases in several European countries, including Turkey. The bomb is said to be compatible with F-35 joint strike fighters, which Turkey is also due to receive amid some controversy. Hurriyet describes the B61 nuclear bomb and Russia’s sour reaction to the prospect of NATO bases receiving them:
The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) and the U.S. Air Force completed two non-nuclear system qualification flight tests of the B61-12 gravity bomb on June 9 at Tonopah Test Range in Nevada, according to a June 29 statement by DOE/NNSA. The test, which was reportedly the first of its kind, was aimed at extending the B61 bomb’s service life by adapting it to next generation aircraft, including B-2A Spirit Bomber. “The B61-12 LEP will consolidate and replace the existing B61 bomb variants in the [U.S.] nuclear stockpile.
Nonetheless, it’s easy to see why these theories are so seductive. Progressives who are surprised by Kennedy’s retirement bought into the myth that the justice, who occasionally swung left on key controversies like abortion and gay rights, was a moderate who dabbled in liberalism. In reality, he never really was a centrist. He voted with the right flank on most issues; his big defections were deviations from the norm. On marriage equality, he was personally sympathetic; on abortion, he genuinely thought he could unite the warring factions.

The number of police officers in Avon and Somerset taking time off for mental health reasons has risen by 450% in less than a decade, the BBC has found. Nearly 15,000 days were lost in 2017-18, compared to about 2,700 in 2009-10, mostly due to stress and depression. Jon Owen from the Police Federation said being a officer was now "highly likely to hurt you". The force's deputy chief constable blamed staff cutbacks and "more complex" challenges for the increase.

Their kids have just been kidnapped. How do you prepare for your [asylum case?] Carlos García, immigration lawyer,
On top of his private practice, García plans to visit Port Isabel a few times a week, which is an hour and a half drive from his office, to give migrants legal advice. He recently committed to fully representing a mother who has not spoken to her six-year-old child in three weeks. García says he’s tempted to take on more cases every time he visits the detention center, and he receives a few emails every day from other lawyers about someone else in need of an attorney.
Azar said that once children and parents are reunited, they will be held in DHS custody. He added that he plans to request additional time from the court "to ensure that we can do the job that we believe is necessary to protect the children in our care." Rose and NPR's Tom Bowman reported last month that the Department of Defense is planning to build "tent encampments on two military bases in Texas to house migrant families apprehended at the border."

Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups. According to the New York Times, the Supreme court’s decision will affect these left-wing groups and causes. “If the progressive movement is a navy, they’re trying to take out our aircraft carriers,” said Ben Wikler, of MoveOn.org, the Times reported. However, progressive groups are optimistic that the loss of union funds will be compensated for with grass-roots activism.

Puente al Desarrollo – A Bridge to Development – is human rights-based legislation that has seen government agencies and communities coming together to address social problems – and support people in meeting their aspirations. The new law applies a social work approach of responding to all the issues that contribute to poverty and strengthening community systems of self-care. Cristian Rodríguez Barrantes, a social worker on a drug-smuggling route in the Costa Rican slums, describes how the law works in practice.

On this much police and activist South Side priest Michael Pfleger can agree: Saturday morning’s anti-violence march on the Dan Ryan Expressway is all about danger. Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.

Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners.

The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.
'THIS IS YOUR RECEIPT': Jarrod W. Ramos, the man suspected of killing five people during an attack on the Capital Gazette newspaper last week in Annapolis, Maryland, sent multiple threatening letters prior to the shooting, police revealed on Monday ... The paper’s former attorney gave police mail he received at his law office on Monday, the newspaper's former publisher Thomas Marquardt told The Baltimore Sun. One of those documents, dated June 28 – the same day as the shooting – allegedly included a letter from Ramos in which he said he was en route to the paper “with the objective of killing every person present.”
The letter was written in the form of a “Motion for Reconsideration” by a Maryland court following a 2016 refusal to hear Ramos’ defamation case that he had filed against the outlet. That stemmed from a 2011 column published in the paper about a criminal harassment charge against Ramos that was filed by a former high school classmate. “You were too cowardly to confront those lies, and this is your receipt,” he allegedly wrote.
ZURICH, July 2 (Reuters) - Swiss asset manager GAM Holding told employees it was preparing for a “worst case” Brexit scenario in which Britain gives up full access to the single market and customs union with the European Union, the Financial Times reported on Monday, citing an internal company email. “We are basing our contingency planning on the worst case,” the email said. Zurich-headquartered GAM later told the Financial Times it was “well placed to respond to any potential outcome of Brexit negotiations” with its operations across the EU, including most of its funds which are based in Ireland or Luxembourg, in response to questions about the email.

A lawmaker and three legislative staffers have accused Attorney General Curtis Hill of inappropriately touching them during a party on the final night of the legislative session, prompting an investigation by leaders of the Indiana General Assembly. Hill denied the allegations in an emailed statement to IndyStar. Details of the accusations are outlined in a confidential June 18 memorandum prepared by the Taft Stettinius & Hollister law firm at the request of legislative leaders.
In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners. Alas, he is wasting his time trying to shift the views of the Democratic Party, which has become ever more left-wing, if not outright socialist. I think it is time for Mr. James to become a Republican. Guy Randolph
Savannah, Ga.
It’s shocking that Mr. James is surprised by the positive economic results of less regulation and lower taxes.
Practice is only one of Deborah Glass’s 125 recommendations not accepted by Victorian government
Female prisoners in Victoria are still subject to “abusive” routine strip searches, a state government watchdog says. The Victorian ombudsman, Deborah Glass, said the government has failed to adopt a recommendation from her 2015 report into the prison system that called for an end to the searches. “Why has the government not accepted my recommendation to stop the abusive practice of routinely strip-searching women prisoners – in fact, the only recommendation out of 125 not accepted?” she asked on Wednesday. The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) spent a total of $4 billion on improper food stamp payments to those receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the USDA confirmed with Breitbart News on Friday. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service announced this week that improper payments made up 6.3 percent of SNAP money in the fiscal year (FY) 2017—the latest data available from the agency. Breitbart News analyzed the USDA’s data on food stamp spending and found that $4,007,026,532 of the $63,603,595,754 the agency spent on SNAP in FY 2017 went to improper payments. The USDA told Breitbart News that “it is important to note that improper payments include both overpayments and underpayments,” meaning that households on SNAP that received less than what they were supposed to receive for the month are also included in the percentage rate. Brandon Lipps, the Acting Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services at the agency, said that most improper payments are due to “human errors”—either because of state agencies miscalculating benefits or benefit recipients giving state agencies the wrong information.The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) spent a total of $4 billion on improper food stamp payments to those receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the USDA confirmed with Breitbart News on Friday.
He should exercise that power, listen to all those marching today & clean up the mess he made w/ his slapdash family separation policy. #FamiliesBelongTogetherMarch — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) June 30, 2018
Democratic activists say the “Abolish ICE” campaign is not intended to open the borders which are guarded by the Customs and Border Protection agency. Instead, the activists say they hope to block ICE from deporting the economic migrants or refugees who get across the border, and who are seeking jobs and apartments as well as schools for their children. But that no-deportations policy would allow many companies to hire illegals instead of Americans. That subsequent rush of migrants would force down wages for Americans and for legal immigrants, force up rents and housing prices, and also overcrowd public K-12 schools.
The report also said that Strzok repeatedly pushed for more aggressive action in the Clinton probe. "The conduct by these employees cast a cloud over the entire FBI investigation and sowed doubt about the FBI’s work," the report concluded. "The damage caused by these employees’ actions extends far beyond the scope of the (Clinton) investigation and goes to the heart of the FBI’s reputation for neutral fact finding and political independence." Goelman, in an op-ed in USA TODAY last month, said Strzok has become the victim of "political gamesmanship" by Congress and President Trump, who has repeatedly tweeted about Strzok as evidence of bias by the FBI and Justice Department. "They have spent months cynically taking these texts out of context and saying that one- or two-word snippets somehow prove that the FBI investigations of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the Russia probe itself, were biased," Goelman wrote.

Nebraska May Join Utah, Idaho in Putting Medicaid Expansion Before Voters
Enlarge this image toggle caption Fred Knapp/NET News Fred Knapp/NET News
Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.
Research has consistently shown that Trump won because of racial resentment among white voters. Chris Hayes (@chrislhayes) The modern GOP is basically Steve Bannon, Steve King and Stephen Miller on one side engaged in a project to preserve and enshrine dominance for its ethnic/racial base, and Paul Ryan and John Roberts on the other who pretend they have no idea what they’re up to. While that strategy has worked in the short-term, some Republicans recognize that it can’t work in the long-term, and they’re fighting to save their party from extinction. Can a carbon tax save the GOP? Climate change is one of many issues that divides the Republican Party.
“Going to the White House was at some personal and reputational cost for both of them. But they care more about trying to be in the ring to fix things than they care about what’s said about them personally.”
That kind of thinking, those associates believe, likely led Nielsen to decide to become the public face of the Trump administration’s decidedly unpopular policy of separating the families of immigrants who cross the border illegally. To say it was a rocky transition is an understatement. During a Cabinet meeting in early May, Trump reportedly berated Nielsen and other officials for 30 minutes, incensed after learning that more than 50,000 people had been arrested for illegally crossing the southern border for two consecutive months—a massive jump in arrests, suggesting a fresh influx of the immigrants the president had promised to stop. A source told POLITICO at the time that Trump believed Nielsen was not focused enough on his immigration agenda.
Hope Life Center in western Illinois provides unplanned pregnancy counseling and ultrasounds for about five to 10 women a week, with a mission to “erase abortion from Illinois one woman and one child at time,” according to its website. So Executive Director Debbie Case was alarmed by a change last year in the state's so-called right-of-conscience law, requiring health care providers to inform pregnant patients of all available medical options, including abortion. She said the pregnancy center even shut down for part of 2017 because its physician feared potential repercussions of violating the law, which is now temporarily blocked by the courts. Case and other anti-abortion advocates across the state hailed Tuesday’s ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court against a similar law in California on First Amendment grounds, hoping the decision will strengthen their legal battle in Illinois. “We’re definitely encouraged,” said Case, whose center is in Sterling, about two hours west of Chicago.
The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. Teachers are also running a ballot measure campaign that would tax the highest income earners for an additional $690 million to spend on schools. “Regardless of political parties, we need people to make a decision about what’s happening in the classroom,” said Marisol Garcia, vice president of the Arizona Education Association. “To limit ourselves and to say ‘only these people are going to support us’ is just not true.”
Teachers can be at a disadvantage compared to wealthier candidates, who tend to have built-in networks of potential donors.
Bishop John Bauerschmidt, who oversees the Middle Tennessee region of the church, stands firmly by his decision not to authorize their use, nor allow clergy within his diocese to officiate the religious ceremonies or permit the weddings on church property. In doing so, the bishop says he is being faithful to his job of guarding the discipline, faith and unity of the church. April 2017: Black female Episcopal bishop of Indy diocese breaks stained glass ceiling
January 2016: Anglicans suspend Episcopal Church over stance on same-sex marriage

"The teaching that Christian marriage is between a man and a woman is reasonable, traditional, and scriptural," Bauerschmidt said in an email. "There really is nothing remarkable about a Christian bishop who holds to this teaching." While Bishops can place limitations on the use of the marriage liturgies, they must refer couples to a willing diocese if they do not authorize them.
Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) trashed the June jobs report — even though it showed rapid job growth, rising wages, and low unemployment. The report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that employers created 213,000 new jobs in June — 22,000 more than economists had expected. Manufacturing jobs in particular rose by 36,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.
He had a small team of allies and has built his political life with them. The big exception was during this election he realized astutely that no one can win by himself. He has built a large coalition that includes a far-right party completely opposed to progressive politics. He has done so because he needed them to win. How will he behave toward those members of his very odd coalition is anyone’s guess.

Nearly 600 more retail jobs are to go in the UK as the Jacques Vert, Windsmoor and Precis department store brands are wound down by administrators. Administrators said they had failed to find a buyer for Calvetron Brands, which had been restructured following a rescue deal last summer. The business entered administration in May and had already shed more than 400 jobs before Wednesday’s announcement. The latest retail job losses come as more than 30,000 jobs are at risk in the UK following mass closure announcements by major chains including House of Fraser, New Look and Marks & Spencer. Retailers are suffering from rising costs and the switch to online shopping just as hard-pressed consumers rein in spending.

The services sector, where most Americans are employed, has now expanded for 101 consecutive months, or more than eight years. The gain was better than many economists had been expecting and depicts an overall economy that appears to be regaining momentum after a slowdown in the winter.
It was no surprise to read that the very first lesson you suggest could be learned from overseas (Five things the NHS could do to improve service, 3 July) is the establishment of integrated health and social care, as has happened in New Zealand. The achievements of the Attlee government are at the heart of my socialist beliefs but the compromises which led then to the split between free NHS care and means-tested social care remain the achilles heel as the NHS celebrates 70 years. It is utterly ludicrous to have separate systems which imply distinct and neat boundaries between health and care, with rather a lot of people making a good living arguing on which side of the fence some poor demented soul belongs. Disputes around the funding of continuing care have become a major industry. The recent NHS funding announcement, making no reference whatsoever to social care, evidenced the fact that the government still hasn’t the least idea of how the two are umbilically linked.

Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation. “We can’t raise enough taxes to fix the structural problem,” Sweeney said in a May appearance on Fox Business Network. On Saturday morning, as the budget deadline approached, labor and liberal groups packed the New Jersey Statehouse to support Murphy in the fight. “Steve Sweeney is engaging in a power struggle with the governor,” said Hetty Rosenstein, New Jersey director for the Communications Workers of America, which represents tens of thousands of state workers.
Having started out with a higher than average unemployment rate, Telford has since witnessed the arrival of major American, European and Japanese businesses: notably Hitachi, Denso, Maxell and Ricoh. Together they brought in thousands of high-technology jobs while the neighbouring Birmingham and Black Country conurbation was still rooted predominantly in traditional metal-based industries. Equally, there is no disguising the scale of the challenges the town has faced along the way. Sixteen years ago, the Commons select committee for transport, local government and the regions reported on new towns in general, but this could could easily have been about Telford in particular:
"While many new towns have been economically successful, most are now experiencing major problems. Their design is inappropriate for the 21st century.

Right on schedule, the presidential motorcade arrived at the Trump National Golf Club in suburban Virginia in the late morning, the middle of a day that also has the president tweeting and hosting a military-themed picnic later at the White House. As he departed the presidential mansion in the morning, Trump took to Twitter. In addition to a general salutation – "Happy Fourth of July....Our Country is doing GREAT!"
Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. Federal prosecutors on Tuesday publicly debunked conspiracy theories pushed by President Donald Trump and right-wing media that a former Democratic aide charged with bank fraud was actually a foreign spy trying to steal government secrets. In a plea deal with Imran Awan, who worked as an information technology aide for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., and other Democratic lawmakers, prosecutors said they had conducted "a thorough investigation" into claims that Awan stole information from government servers on behalf of another country while working for House Democrats, but reported that they found no evidence to support the conspiracy theories. "The Government agrees that the public allegations that (Awan) stole U.S. House of Representatives equipment and engaged in unauthorized or illegal conduct involving House computer systems do not form the basis of any conduct relevant to the determination of the sentence in this case," prosecutors said.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
The government agency that oversees immigration applications is hiring lawyers and immigration officers to review cases of immigrants suspected of obtaining citizenship through fake identities or other false information on their applications. Cases would be referred to the Department of Justice, where offenders could lose their citizenship or legal status. The small scale of this effort belies its significance. As a country, the United States makes few distinctions between naturalized citizens and their native-born counterparts. The naturalization process, which includes long-term residents with deep ties to the U.S., is assumed to be permanent.

On Thursday he traveled to Wisconsin to celebrate the groundbreaking of a $10 billion assembly plant for Foxconn Technology Group, the Taiwanese iPhone contractor's first major U.S. facility. Trump hailed the construction of a plant he said would be "the 8th wonder of the world" as an endorsement of his policies. "We have a lot of things going in the United States," he said.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.
State and local government construction spending was $282.1 billion, the most since September of 2009. Spending on the power grid increased nearly 11 percent on a monthly basis, and is up more than 25 percent over a year ago.
The prospect of a major shooting war cannot be dismissed. To this anxious litany Trump brings a reassuring antidote: more nationalism. Some of Trump’s efforts to control globalization have already backfired. To wit: Harley-Davidson’s decision to move some production to Europe — in response to Europe’s higher tariffs on Harley-Davidson bikes, which in turn were a reaction to Trump’s higher tariffs on European steel and aluminum exports.

Many Americans gaze at the sky and see only a vast uncharted frontier for exploration. But President Donald Trump reminds Americans that there’s another potential reality in space: It could become a military battlefield, a place where this nation’s independence is protected or lost.

It never helped my self-image. It only made me despise myself more and more.

Anna Mae Blessing was arrested on suspicion of shooting her son to death in the home on Monday after she refused to go to an assisted living facility, according to the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office. Police had visited the home on numerous domestic and knew there were guns in the home before Blessing shot her son, Thomas Blessing, 72, who lived in the home with his girlfriend and mother, officials said. There were six calls for service since January according to MCSO.
He aligned himself with most of his Democratic colleagues against Gina Haspel, Trump's pick for CIA director, arguing that her record on enhanced interrogation techniques was unacceptable. And instead of focusing on a politically safe issue in his maiden Senate floor speech, Jones struck a nerve by calling for a dialogue on gun violence after the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida. In addition, during the campaign, Jones made no secret of his desire to protect LGBTQ rights and to support a woman's right to abortion. It's those kinds of positions that have made him a darling of Alabama's progressive minority — and somewhat of a public enemy among the state's conservative majority. Jones has introduced four pieces of legislation — none of any huge significance — since he arrived on Capitol Hill, including two agriculture bills, one that would expand access to capital for rural job creators and the last seeking to mandate an annual Medicaid expansion review.
The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. Teachers are also running a ballot measure campaign that would tax the highest income earners for an additional $690 million to spend on schools. “Regardless of political parties, we need people to make a decision about what’s happening in the classroom,” said Marisol Garcia, vice president of the Arizona Education Association. “To limit ourselves and to say ‘only these people are going to support us’ is just not true.”
Teachers can be at a disadvantage compared to wealthier candidates, who tend to have built-in networks of potential donors.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau responded on Sunday to allegations that he groped a woman at a music festival in Creston, British Columbia, nearly two decades ago. “I remember that day in Creston well,” he told reporters during a three-day tour in Regina, Canada. “I had a good day that day. I don’t remember any negative interactions that day at all.”
The allegations against Trudeau resurfaced in June when a Twitter user shared a photo of an editorial article written by an anonymous reporter in 2000 in Creston Valley Advance, a local newspaper. The article alleges that Trudeau, then a 28-year-old teacher, groped a female reporter at the Kokanee Summit music festival in 2000.
The new law - approved by 87 votes to 15 in the 120-seat Knesset late on Monday - requires the Israeli government to withhold an amount of tax revenue equal to what is paid by the PA to "individuals who were involved in terror activity against Israelis and their families". If the defence ministry determines that such payments are no longer being made, the frozen funds will be returned to the PA.
Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman hailed the legislation, saying: "An effective war on terrorism also passes through the pocket - of the terrorists, of their families and of [Palestinian Authority President] Mahmoud Abbas." Image copyright AFP Image caption The law's sponsors said the PA's payments were "an expression of support for acts of terror"
But chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat condemned what he called a "very dangerous decision that amounts to the cancellation of the Palestinian Authority and is piracy and theft". The PA's Minister of Prisoner Affairs, Issa Qaraqeh, meanwhile insisted the payments would continue. "When we signed Oslo Agreement, it was clear to Israel that the Palestinian Authority pays these families, and they never objected," he was quoted as saying by the Associated Press.
Even Pruitt’s own staff had begun to sour on him, with many worrying that their future career prospects would be damaged by their association with Pruitt’s tenure. Each scandal seemed more damning than the last. Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.
He replaced the head of his security detail who wouldn’t let him use lights and sirens to zip around the city like the president. And a top career official was dismissed after he questioned the security justifications for Pruitt’s beefed up, multimillion-dollar protective detail. Questions were raised about why Pruitt hired a longtime friend, whose bank over the years issued Pruitt multiple mortgages and helped him buy part ownership of a baseball team, and who was recently banned from the banking industry, to run EPA’s Superfund program. In recent weeks, former Pruitt aides told staffers on the House Oversight Committee about the administrator's search for a high-paying job for his wife and his use of EPA time and staff for personal matters. Although nascent, the new allegations raised questions of whether Pruitt had used his position to benefit his family or himself.

The court documents detail the accounts of four unnamed women, identified as Jane Does 1, 2, 3, and 4. Local reports cited depositions that Large took before his death wherein he reportedly admitted to suggesting some of the women participate in "catfight videos" for money, but he denied the claims of sexual assault. Now his five of his former supervisors, police department, and Horry County officials are facing claims from two of the victims, Jane Does 3 and 4, for allegedly failing to prevent years of egregious abuse. Large died in January, 16 months after he was indicted. On Monday, a judge rejected a motion for summary judgment from the defendants and decided the case would move forward with a trial against the Horry County Police Department and Horry County.

The first, Antonio Halili, was the mayor of the much larger Tanauan City, south of Manila. Unlike Bote, Halili had developed both a reputation for having a heavy hand against drug traffickers and negotiating with them. Halili appeared on a more recent Duterte list of elected officials with ties to drug trafficking in 2017. Shortly after Halili’s assassination, Duterte told reporters, “I don’t know who killed him, but I told you don’t [engage in illegal drugs]. … His procession of drug suspects was just a front.”
Prior to this accusation, however, Halili had established a “walk of shame” program where he paraded drug suspects around his city for the public to jeer, leading others in the government to suggest he was killed by drug traffickers in revenge for humiliating their peers.
"Unlike our forerunners in 1968, those of us living today have access to something they didn't," said Mary Eberstadt, a widely published Catholic writer, "50 years of sociological, psychological, medical, and other evidence about the revolution's fallout." Some of the lines in Humanae Vitae, when stripped of mid-20th century cultural references, find echoes in contemporary concerns about nonconsensual sexual relations. "A man who grows accustomed to the use of contraceptive methods may forget the reverence due to a woman," the pope wrote, "... and reduce her to a mere instrument of his own desires." "This document that has been so controversial and in many places reviled," Eberstadt says, "actually called the shots on what the future would look like better than any other single source I could think of." Revisionist views of the 1968 encyclical have even taken hold among some Catholics who have not abided by its teaching.
Sixteen years ago, the Commons select committee for transport, local government and the regions reported on new towns in general, but this could could easily have been about Telford in particular:
"While many new towns have been economically successful, most are now experiencing major problems. Their design is inappropriate for the 21st century. Their infrastructure is aging at the same rate and many have social and economic problems...
"The new towns are no longer new and many of the quickly-built houses have reached the end of their design life. The master-plans dictated low density developments with large amounts of open space, and housing segregated from jobs, shopping and business services. These created car dependency and are now not considered sustainable.
In one case, Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion that illegal immigrants do not have the same bargaining rights as American citizens and legal workers. “… an illegal immigrant worker is not an ’employee’ under the NLRA for the simple reason that, ever since 1986, an illegal immigrant worker is not a lawful ’employee’ in the United States,” Kavanaugh wrote. In another case, Kavanaugh noted that American multi-national corporations do not have the right to import foreign workers. The Circuit judge explained, “Under the provision of the immigration laws at issue here, mere economic expediency does not authorize an employer to displace American workers for foreign workers.”
Prominent conservative Ann Coulter has also called for Trump to nominate Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, arguing that other judges such as Thomas Hardiman and Raymond Kethledge “are open borders zealots.”

"Peace and tranquility are the fruits of justice," Lopez Obrador said. Exit polling by Consulta Mitofsky for the Televisa network forecast gubernatorial wins for allies of Lopez Obrador's Morena party in at least four of eight state races on the ballot plus for the head of government in Mexico City. The central state of Guanajuato was expected to go to a candidate of the conservative National Action Party. Mitofsky predicted Morena allies would take between 56 and 70 seats in the 128-member Senate and between 256 and 291 spots in the 500-seat lower house. "The anger that the average Mexican feels toward the way things are being governed has favored Lopez Obrador," said Shannon O'Neil, senior fellow for Latin America Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.

LONDON — Over the past century American and British troops have fought side-by-side in two World Wars, Korea and the conflicts in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan. But some lawmakers and experts in the United Kingdom are warning that the British military could soon be seen as irrelevant by the United States unless it receives a colossal funding boost. "There is a concern that the U.K. is falling ever further behind and becoming even more useless from a U.S. point of view," said Andrew Dorman, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a think tank in London.
That will allow Trump to argue that his tough approach to trade is paying off. There are reasons why the US economy is currently strong, but none of them have anything to do with tariffs on imports. In part, it is the lagged effect of a buoyant global economy in 2017; in part it is explained by tax cuts and the stimulus still being provided by only gently rising interest rates. Mickey Levy, chief US economist for Berenberg, says Trump’s deregulation agenda has been a factor in boosting America’s underlying growth rate. Evidence from Barack Obama’s presidency shows how protectionist policies can backfire.

DRIVERS AND VOTERS
The United States has always been both a major producer and consumer of oil, which means that most presidents have favored moderate oil prices. High prices hurt motorists and oil consumers across the country.
“That was a very sad day for the country when that vote was cast,” Trump said in June. But Republican lawmakers dispute arguments suggesting their efforts to undo ObamaCare have been totally fruitless. “We eliminated the individual mandate that said that people had to buy government-approved insurance,” said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo. “In a sense, it blew a big hole in ObamaCare.”
There’s a potential electoral landmine ahead for Republicans hoping to keep their majorities in the House and Senate, though: premium increases. “We’re going to get another round right before the election, which is something the GOP is nervous about,” said John C. Goodman, president of the Goodman Institute.

'THIS IS YOUR RECEIPT': Jarrod W. Ramos, the man suspected of killing five people during an attack on the Capital Gazette newspaper last week in Annapolis, Maryland, sent multiple threatening letters prior to the shooting, police revealed on Monday ... The paper’s former attorney gave police mail he received at his law office on Monday, the newspaper's former publisher Thomas Marquardt told The Baltimore Sun. One of those documents, dated June 28 – the same day as the shooting – allegedly included a letter from Ramos in which he said he was en route to the paper “with the objective of killing every person present.”
The letter was written in the form of a “Motion for Reconsideration” by a Maryland court following a 2016 refusal to hear Ramos’ defamation case that he had filed against the outlet. That stemmed from a 2011 column published in the paper about a criminal harassment charge against Ramos that was filed by a former high school classmate. “You were too cowardly to confront those lies, and this is your receipt,” he allegedly wrote.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
While most of these foreign doctors are perfectly capable, a disproportionate number turn out to be incompetent, with more than half of doctors subject to ‘fitness to practice’ investigation by the General Medical Council (GMC) being non-British. Critics suggest that plundering the Third World of clinicians rather than training British talent will disincentivise poor countries from investing in medical training, as the investment is a waste of limited resources if doctors simply leave for Western countries once qualified. However, new Home Secretary Sajid Javid does not appear to be changing course and is actually relaxing immigration controls to recruit more foreign medical personnel. At the same time, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is making it harder to remove doctors who kill their patients from the medical register at the same time, leading to concerns that the Government is facilitating a massive fall in standards.

The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said. Carney said the impact from the president’s use of import tariffs against major trading partners including the EU and China, alongside their retaliatory measures, was already being seen through measures of global exports and manufacturing in recent weeks. “There are some tentative signs that this more hostile and uncertain trading environment may be dampening activity,” he said. Surveys of factory output in the US and the eurozone earlier this week showed firms were facing higher prices as a consequence of the import tariffs, as well as American manufacturers having the longest delivery delays on record.
Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.

Over the fireplace at Mingo Creek Craft Distillers, a whiskey purveyor in the small town of Washington, Pennsylvania, a portrait of Alexander Hamilton hangs upside down. With snowy hair and a black velvet jacket, Hamilton wears an impassive look that might be described as hauteur. In 1791, to pay off debts the newly formed United States incurred during the revolutionary war, Hamilton imposed the first federal tax on the people of the region. By taxing their most lucrative product, whiskey, he became what he is here today: a villain representing the excesses of the federal government. The town of Washington is only a six-hour drive from Manhattan, but it’s a world away from the Broadway stage where Hamilton, clad in snug white knickers, enjoys a better reputation.

Began his career in environmental law at the EPA, as a special assistant in the agency's toxics office during President George H.W. Spent years playing various roles on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, which oversees the EPA, drafting regulations on chemical safety, air and water pollution and climate change — generally seeking to reduce government regulations on industries that generate greenhouse gases. Served as longtime aide to Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., whom you may recall from the 2015 floor speech in which he rebutted climate change science with a snowball. After leaving Congress, worked for years as a lobbyist for some of the largest coal, chemical and uranium companies in the U.S. — including the uranium mining firm that pushed for the reduction of Bears Ears National Monument, which is near one of its processing facilities.

As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
Even Pruitt’s own staff had begun to sour on him, with many worrying that their future career prospects would be damaged by their association with Pruitt’s tenure. Each scandal seemed more damning than the last. Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.
LONDON (Reuters) - The United States and Saudi Arabia appear to have reached an understanding: Washington will reduce or eliminate Iran’s oil export revenues and in return Riyadh will guarantee oil supplies and stabilize prices.

The basic deal is well understood by policymakers in both countries, with U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly emphasizing his great personal relationship with the Saudi king and crown prince. But strong personal relationships between the leaders and agreement on the overall deal obscure disagreement on some key details, not least the desirable level for oil prices.
It was described as a tense meeting, the BBC's Norman Smith said. Mrs May is trying to find an arrangement to unite her cabinet when ministers gather at her country retreat, Chequers, on Friday. The UK is leaving the EU in March 2019, but has yet to agree how it will trade with the remaining EU members - who are part of a single market and a customs union - in years to come. Some former Remain campaigners want the government to pursue close ties to the EU to avoid barriers to trade with Europe - but Eurosceptics say the UK needs freedom to set its own independent trade policy. After two alternative models for customs were criticised, Downing Street has come up with what it calls a "third way" solution to be presented on Friday, claiming it will offer "the best of both worlds" - frictionless trade with Europe and the freedom to strike international trade deals.

But they split almost down the middle, 42 percent to 39 percent, when asked whether they are proud of America right now. Not surprisingly, the split was along partisan lines: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. There was bipartisan agreement on one thing: Across party lines, roughly seven in 10 agree with the statement, "I feel fatigued watching the news." Elsewhere in politics

Just hours after his historic election victory sent thousands of supporters pouring on to the streets, the 64-year-old leftist tweeted that he had received a call from Donald Trump. “I proposed that we explore an integral agreement of development projects, which generate jobs in Mexico and with that reduce migration and improve security. There was respectful treatment and our representatives will speak more.”
In an interview with the Televisa news network, López Obrador emphasized the need for mutual respect and cooperation between the two neighbors. “We are conscious of the need to maintain good relations with the United States. We have a border of more than 3,000 kilometers, more than 12 million Mexicans live in the United States.

In addition to the 13 people who were killed, more than 1,000 others were sickened when plastic bags containing the poison were leaked on five subway lines on March 20, 1995. At least 4,000 more turned up at hospitals for treatment of anxiety and trauma reactions.

In the survey, most say they are proud to be Americans, although Republicans feel that way more strongly (90 percent) than Democrats (61 percent).

A helicopter trip to a hospital may not be the only shock a patient faces after a bad accident. The next one could hit when the bill arrives. Rides in so-called air ambulances can lead to bills of more than $20,000 depending on a person's coverage, and insurance experts say big invoices are becoming more common as costs rise and coverage shifts. Air ambulances transport around 400,000 people each year in the U.S., according to industry estimates. Most trips are from one hospital to another.
For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future. "It troubles me to see my brother who is 18 years old — if he makes key decisions in a negative way, he can be in a jail cell," he reflected. Because the first thing is the color of your skin."
Practice is only one of Deborah Glass’s 125 recommendations not accepted by Victorian government
Female prisoners in Victoria are still subject to “abusive” routine strip searches, a state government watchdog says. The Victorian ombudsman, Deborah Glass, said the government has failed to adopt a recommendation from her 2015 report into the prison system that called for an end to the searches. “Why has the government not accepted my recommendation to stop the abusive practice of routinely strip-searching women prisoners – in fact, the only recommendation out of 125 not accepted?” she asked on Wednesday. The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
Scott Pruitt has resigned as head of the Environmental Protection Agency after a string of controversies involving his leadership, President Trump announced Thursday on Twitter. "Within the Agency Scott has done an outstanding job, and I will always be thankful to him for this," tweeted Trump, who added that EPA Deputy Administrator Andrew Wheeler would take over as acting administrator effective Monday. "I have no doubt that Andy will continue on with our great and lasting EPA agenda," Trump concluded. "We have made tremendous progress and the future of the EPA is very bright!" In his resignation letter to Trump, Pruitt said: "It is extremely difficult for me to cease serving you in this role first because I count it a blessing to be serving you in any capacity, but also, because of the transformative work that is occurring.
"I think my own view is that China and the U.S. have this unavoidable mutuality where China only wins if the U.S. wins and the U.S. only wins if China wins and the world only wins if China and the U.S. win," Cook said in an early May conference call with investors to discuss the company's financial performance. "And so I think there's lots of things that bind the countries together and I'm actually very optimistic." Outside of Silicon Valley, several prominent Republicans have expressed concerns over the tariffs the administration is placing on Chinese goods. Former Massachusetts governor and presidential candidate Mitt Romney expressed hope that the tariffs can be quickly removed and a new trade agreement can be agreed upon by the world's two largest economies. "Trade wars are a tax on Americans," Romney wrote on Twitter.
A judge ordered federal emergency officials to extend vouchers for temporary hotel housing for nearly 1,700 Puerto Rican hurricane evacuees, saying ending the program could cause irreparable harm. Saturday night's decision came shortly after civil rights group LatinoJustice PRLDEF filed a lawsuit seeking relief for the Puerto Ricans, whose federal housing assistance vouchers were set to expire at midnight Sunday, meaning the evacuees could have been evicted from the hotels. The order says the agency cannot end its Transitional Sheltering Assistance program until at least midnight on Tuesday. The organization is pushing to let families stay another six months. U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin of Massachusetts wrote that ending the program would drain other public resources.
Any amount of prescription opioid use was correlated with greater involvement. Among people with prescription opioid use disorder, nearly 20 percent had criminal justice involvement. For heroin users, it was 40 percent. "People who use opioids, including heroin, were up to 13 times more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system," says Winkelman. The study shows the complexity of the the opioid crisis, according to Josiah Rich, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Brown University, who wasn't involved in the research.

Three of the teens were named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit. Howard told U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Dillon during a status conference Tuesday that all three original plaintiffs are no longer part of the case. But he said another teen "is anxious to participate in the case" and will be named as a new plaintiff. "We believe that his allegations with respect to his experience at the facility are sufficiently analogous ... to those of John Does Nos. 1, 2 and 3," Howard said.
"Peace and tranquility are the fruits of justice," Lopez Obrador said. Exit polling by Consulta Mitofsky for the Televisa network forecast gubernatorial wins for allies of Lopez Obrador's Morena party in at least four of eight state races on the ballot plus for the head of government in Mexico City. The central state of Guanajuato was expected to go to a candidate of the conservative National Action Party. Mitofsky predicted Morena allies would take between 56 and 70 seats in the 128-member Senate and between 256 and 291 spots in the 500-seat lower house. "The anger that the average Mexican feels toward the way things are being governed has favored Lopez Obrador," said Shannon O'Neil, senior fellow for Latin America Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.
3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.
Most were in their twenties, and some were couples, but otherwise, they fit no single profile. Only a little information about their fate has trickled out from the secretive North Korean regime. The full explanation of why they were taken remains a mystery. The unexplained state-sponsored crime has shaped Japanese politics, with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe using the abductions to capitalize on anti-North Korean sentiment and advance his political career. Today, Megumi’s image is plastered on posters as the face of the issue, and her story has become a potent source of nationalism, frequently told in government-produced anime films and comic books.

An IPO market that was left for dead just two years ago has come roaring back in 2018, with companies raising public capital at a pace rarely seen in the past two decades. So far this year, 120 companies have used initial public offerings to raise $35.2 billion on U.S. exchanges. That is the highest volume since 2012 and the fourth-busiest year-to-date on record, according to Dealogic, whose data go back to 1995.

It's difficult to imagine Old Hickory, as he was known, excusing himself from military duty on the grounds that he could not march long distances, as Mr Trump did during the Vietnam War, citing bone spurs. The parallels between the 45th president and the 13th - unlucky for some - are arguably more compelling. Fillmore launched his career in the 1820s with the Anti-Masonic Party, hawking a paranoid rumour that ruling Freemasons were murdering whistleblowers. Mr Trump paved the way for his White House bid by peddling a conspiracy theory, too - that President Barack Obama was not a US citizen.

Fillmore later joined the Whig Party at a time of mounting hostility to refugees from famine, rebellion and tyranny who were arriving by the shipload at the gates of the New World.
This is just terrible timing all around." Medicaid, an $11 billion, state-federal health plan in Kentucky, covers 1.4 million people, about 600,000 of them children. The federal government provides about 80 percent of the state's Medicaid funds. The cuts to dental and vision benefits were supposed to affect only able-bodied adults, mostly those added to Medicaid under an expansion authorized through the Affordable Care Act.
ZTE is far from alone. China assembles some 90 percent of the world's smartphones, computers and other electronics. But most of the revenue flows to American companies that supply computer chips and other technology.

What Washington welcomes as a source of well-paid jobs, Chinese leaders consider a dangerous dependence.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
No one was ever arrested for the blaze, although Fieseler writes about how investigators keyed into one main suspect in the fire — a disgruntled bar patron who'd been kicked out earlier in the day and had been heard threatening to burn the place down. It wasn't until 2003 that a plaque commemorating the fire's victims was laid. New Orleans was a conflicted place for the gay community at the time of the fire, Fieseler says. In some ways, the city was a haven for the gay community where people could be themselves. But there were also raids on gay bars, harassment, and discrimination: "An individual who was quiet and who was closeted gay, could find companionship, could find love and joy, could have a job, could have a house, so long as this individual never spoke the dreaded H.

The DJT Restaurant, the upscale eatery that bears Trump's initials, was shut down for several hours following a November 2012 inspection at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. That inspection, conducted four years before Trump won the White House, cited 51 demerits for such violations as keeping food items well past their expiration dates.
Austria plans to revoke the legal immunity of an Iranian diplomat who is suspected of involvement in a plot to bomb an Iranian opposition rally in France, officials said Tuesday. The Iranian government was notified that the man's diplomatic status would be canceled within 48 hours unless Tehran does so first, Matthias Forenbacher, a spokesman for Austria's foreign minister, told The Associated Press. The diplomat, Assadollah Assadi, was detained Sunday near the German city of Aschaffenburg on a European arrest warrant after a couple with Iranian roots was stopped in Belgium and authorities reported finding powerful explosives in their car. The web site of the Austrian Foreign Ministry lists Assadi as a counselor at the Iranian Embassy in Vienna. Iran's ambassador was summoned to the ministry Monday and asked to "contribute to clarifying the situation," Forenbacher said.
The number of predominantly Christian people killed in Nigeria by Muslim Fulani terrorists in the first six months of this year has dwarfed the fatalities carried out by the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL)-affiliated Boko Haram, a non-governmental organization (NGO) based in the African country revealed this week. In one weekend last month (June 23 and 24), the Fulani stormed nearly a dozen Christian-majority villages in Nigeria’s Plateau state, using machetes and firearms to massacre at least 200 people, including women and children. Referring to the Plateau incident in an article published by Nigeria’s Daily Post, the NGO, known as the International Society for Civil Liberties and the Rule of Law (Intersociety), noted Monday that the fatalities from the Fulani massacre could reach 300, making it one of the deadliest by any group in Nigeria. Intersociety explains:
The total death toll in Plateau State following the 23rd and 24th June 2018 coordinated attacks and killings in eleven villages may most likely have hit 300, from its present 250, out of which 218 bodies have been recovered and buried in mass graves. The activists on the ground said dozens of people are still missing after the head count was carried out.
Some immigrant U.S. Army reservists and recruits who enlisted in the military with a promised path to citizenship are being abruptly discharged, the Associated Press has learned. The AP was unable to quantify how many men and women who enlisted through the special recruitment program have been booted from the Army, but immigration attorneys say they know of more than 40 who have been discharged or whose status has become questionable, jeopardizing their futures. "It was my dream to serve in the military," said reservist Lucas Calixto, a Brazilian immigrant who filed a lawsuit against the Army last week. "Since this country has been so good to me, I thought it was the least I could do to give back to my adopted country and serve in the United States military." Some of the service members say they were not told why they were being discharged.

Those factories are the core of an American operation that employs about 136,000 people, but they're also dependent on components sourced overseas for reasons of cost or availability.

Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left a demoralized agency where staff fear their ability to protect public health is diminished
Scott Pruitt is out but his impact on the environment will be felt for years
Scott Pruitt, who has finally stepped down as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency after a long-rumbling corruption scandal, rose to public prominence on the back of a series of increasingly outlandish ethical controversies. Scott Pruitt resigns: Trump's scandal-ridden EPA chief steps down Read more
From lobbying fast food company Chick-fil-A on behalf of his wife, to demanding his staff acquire a mattress from a Trump Hotel – not to mention the millions of taxpayer dollars spent on security, first-class travel and soundproof booths – Pruitt’s behavior clashed spectacularly with any pretense of Trump’s pledge to “drain the swamp” in Washington. But the lasting legacy of the former Oklahoma attorney general – who was picked by Trump after crusading against what he called the EPA’s “activist agenda” – is likely to be felt in the systematic weakening of environmental regulations. While not as eye-catching as, for example, his demand that his official vehicle use sirens so he could reach a French restaurant on time, Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left behind a demoralized agency where staff fret that their ability to protect public health has been diminished. A staunch ally of oil and gas companies, Pruitt stacked EPA advisory boards with industry representatives and sought to set aside whole troves of research that link pollution to various illnesses.

Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop.

They include the United States withdrawing its 28,500 troops in South Korea, ending its military drills with South Korea and stop bringing in strategic assets such as aircraft carriers and nuclear-capable bombers. North Korea hasn't repeated such specific demands since entering disarmament talks earlier this year, raising optimism that the country truly appeared to seek to improve ties with the United States. After the summit, Trump suspended annual military training with South Korea that the North has called an invasion rehearsal. But North Korea still prefers a step-by-step disarmament process with reciprocal concessions and benefits from the United States for each of the North's denuclearization steps. The ultimate rewards North Korea wants range from the easing or lifting of American-led international sanctions, the signing of a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, the establishment of diplomatic ties and the pulling out of U.S. troops in South Korea, experts say.

That will allow Trump to argue that his tough approach to trade is paying off. There are reasons why the US economy is currently strong, but none of them have anything to do with tariffs on imports. In part, it is the lagged effect of a buoyant global economy in 2017; in part it is explained by tax cuts and the stimulus still being provided by only gently rising interest rates. Mickey Levy, chief US economist for Berenberg, says Trump’s deregulation agenda has been a factor in boosting America’s underlying growth rate. Evidence from Barack Obama’s presidency shows how protectionist policies can backfire.
"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said.

BREAKING: @NEAToday President @Lily_NEA reacts to radical ruling by #SCOTUS: "We are living in a system that is rigged to benefit special interests & billionaires, all at the expense of working people."

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.
State and local government construction spending was $282.1 billion, the most since September of 2009. Spending on the power grid increased nearly 11 percent on a monthly basis, and is up more than 25 percent over a year ago.
It's difficult to imagine Old Hickory, as he was known, excusing himself from military duty on the grounds that he could not march long distances, as Mr Trump did during the Vietnam War, citing bone spurs. The parallels between the 45th president and the 13th - unlucky for some - are arguably more compelling. Fillmore launched his career in the 1820s with the Anti-Masonic Party, hawking a paranoid rumour that ruling Freemasons were murdering whistleblowers. Mr Trump paved the way for his White House bid by peddling a conspiracy theory, too - that President Barack Obama was not a US citizen.

Fillmore later joined the Whig Party at a time of mounting hostility to refugees from famine, rebellion and tyranny who were arriving by the shipload at the gates of the New World.
Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) trashed the June jobs report — even though it showed rapid job growth, rising wages, and low unemployment. The report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that employers created 213,000 new jobs in June — 22,000 more than economists had expected. Manufacturing jobs in particular rose by 36,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.
In addition, a group of incumbent Democrats – including U.S. Rep. Brian Higgins of New York and Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania – say they won’t back Pelosi for another term as party leader. "Our leadership is out of touch with what is going on, not only in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan but in Cheektowaga, West Seneca, Hamburg, Orchard Park and Lancaster," Higgins told the Buffalo News, referring to swing states that voted for Donald Trump in 2016, as well as municipalities near Buffalo. "Our leadership is out of touch with what is going on ... in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan ... " - U.S. Rep. Brian Higgins, D-N.Y.
Perhaps the biggest blow to Pelosi’s future prospects occurred last Tuesday in New York City, when 28-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeated longtime U.S. Rep. Joseph Crowley, 56, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. To many political watchers, it suggested that Democratic voters have grown tired of the party’s old guard and want a new generation of leaders. But Pelosi quickly dismissed Ocasio-Cortez’s upset victory as a “one district” fluke – a comment that may serve only to further inspire the younger, more far-left candidates seeking to move on Pelosi and her contemporaries.

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has promoted 16,900 soldiers as a reward for their "loyalty". The promotion comes amid a worsening economic and political crisis during which opposition politicians have called on the armed forces to side "with the people". Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino said those promoted had been "loyal to the constitutionally elected president". He also praised them "for respecting human rights". The promotion comes just 10 days after the UN human rights body released a report saying that Venezuelan security forces had carried out hundreds of arbitrary killings.
This was particularly an issue for Pruitt’s former executive scheduler Sydney Hupp, who often had to shell out for Pruitt’s trips. Hupp was also asked by Pruitt to speak with staff at one of Trump’s hotels, believing he could get a deal on a second-hand mattress they were selling. Pruitt remained miserly even when he was abusing his position to get a good deal. He fell behind on the rental payments on the condo he was getting on the cheap and eventually had to be evicted and the locks were changed.
Kinner was being held without bail at the Ada County jail on 15 charges, including six of injury to a child and nine of aggravated battery, jail records showed. There was no lawyer listed for Kinner in the records. Kinner may have wanted to “extract vengeance” for being kicked out by a tenant who took him in, Police Chief Bill Bones said at a press conference on Sunday. The woman who took Kinner in was not harmed and was not at the residence at the time of the attack. Kinner assaulted the children at the party after he was unable to find the woman, police said, adding his motive was still under investigation.
Part of its mission is to provide local veterans with a monthly ration of what he calls medical-grade cannabis free of charge. It started back in 2011. Newsom and his co-founder began growing and sharing pot as an alternative to the drugs the VA had them on. It has since grown to serve about 1,000 veterans. The office where he's sorting the cannabis sits above one of their grow operations.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
The program, also known as a white hat operation, was part of a broader plan to get the company to treat disinformation campaigns by governments differently than it did more traditional problems such as spam, which is aimed at tricking individual users as opposed to shaping the political climate in an entire country, according to these people. Harvey said she had not heard of the operation. Some executives initially were reluctant to act aggressively against suspected fake accounts and raised questions about the legality of doing so, said the people familiar with internal company debates. In November, one frustrated engineer sought to illustrate the severity of the problem by buying thousands of fake followers for a Twitter manager, said two people familiar with the episode. Bots can be readily purchased on a gray market of websites.
Teddy Roosevelt hopped on whistle stop tour after whistle stop tour where he was able to drop into rural and suburban communities alike to deliver short, pre-packaged speeches that local papers would usually print verbatim. (He left them short on purpose for that very reason.) Franklin Roosevelt revolutionized and heightened the stature of the office with his fireside chats, that brought his message over the heads of the pesky press corps and directly into the living rooms of the American people. But, though it would have been seen as a scoop, even the reporters covering Lyndon B. Johnson had the good sense not to report on every turd he dropped in their presence. While the founders envisioned a government that moved slowly and methodically, today’s Wi-Fi-enabled political discourse is demanding the opposite.

But late on Saturday U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin of Massachusetts ordered the U.S. government to extend the aid for hotel vouchers to at least check-out time on July 4. At the hearing, he could decide whether to extend it further. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has said 1,722 families are currently receiving aid under its housing program, 585 of whom reside in Central Florida motels. FEMA said in a statement on Sunday it was aware of the judge’s decision and was contacting vendors to comply with the court order. U.S. Democratic Representative Darren Soto, whose Kissimmee district includes Puerto Ricans facing eviction, said a displaced family can either remain in the hotel with the looming fear of losing aid or take a free flight back to the island.

He said contracts obtained under energy reforms passed under President Enrique Pena Nieto will be scrutinized for any corruption or illegality, but otherwise contracts will be honored. "There will be no confiscation or expropriation of assets. ... Eradicating corruption will be the principal mission," he said. Lopez Obrador also spoke of reducing Mexican immigration to the United States through economic development. "Mexicans will be able ... to work and be happy where they were born," he said.
Iraqi Christian leaders praised U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration this week for keeping the pledge to help victims of the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) genocide campaign against ethnoreligious minority groups in the Middle East. “Our hopes are high now that this delegation will bring some changes. We especially appreciate the efforts of Vice President [Mike] Pence and USAID [U.S. Agency for International Development] to have them deeply involved in this situation,” Archbishop Bashar Warda of Iraqi Kurdistan’s capital Erbil told the Catholic News Service (CNS). In October 2017, the Trump administration fulfilled the vice president’s promise to “stop funding ineffective relief efforts at the United Nations,” choosing instead to provide tens of millions of dollars directly through USAID to Christians, Yazidis, and other religious minorities in Iraq. “USAID has provided $10 million to various charities, including Catholic Relief Services [CRS] and Heartland Alliance, to help Christians and Yazidis rebuild their homes, after multitudes were killed or driven out by IS in 2014 and subsequent years.
"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.
A new USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll about patriotism, pegged to this week's celebration of the Fourth of July, finds an overwhelming majority of those surveyed — 90 percent — say they are proud to be Americans. But they split almost down the middle, 42 percent to 39 percent, when asked whether they are proud of America right now. Not surprisingly, the split was along partisan lines: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. There was bipartisan agreement on one thing: Across party lines, roughly seven in 10 agree with the statement, "I feel fatigued watching the news." Elsewhere in politics

U.S. Government lawyers are slamming one of President Donald Trump's most prominent critics, attorney Michael Avenatti, over nearly half a million dollars in unpaid federal taxes owed by his former firm. Avenatti's former law firm, Eagan Avenatti LLP, agreed to make the roughly $452,000 tax payment last month in order to resolve a bankruptcy case, but the funds never arrived at the IRS, according to a filing Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, Calif.

Because it is also a flood plain, the project’s 989,000 solar panels will be mounted on frames 12ft tall – the height of a double-decker bus. Unlike most solar farms, Cleve Hill Solar Park’s panels will not all face south, but east and west in a continuous zig-zag. The effect, say the scheme’s opponents, will be to turn green meadows into something resembling a colossal factory roof. Economically and environmentally the scheme makes no sense whatsoever. Apart from ruining a huge swathe of countryside and killing or displacing all the local wildlife, it will do little for Britain’s energy needs.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”

Pentagon Questioned Over Blackout On War Zone Troop Numbers

For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.

Jaguar Land Rover, Britain's biggest carmaker with 40,000 employees, cautioned this week that a bad deal would slash its profits by £1.2 billion ($1.6 billion) a year. Airbus (EADSF) and BMW (BMWYY) also issued dire warnings. The plan announced Friday acknowledges that banking and other UK service industries, which make up the vast majority of the UK economy, would lose some access to European markets. But Britain's biggest business lobby group, the Confederation of British Industry, welcomed Friday's announcement as a "good starting point." "This is a genuine confidence boost and the prime minister deserves credit for delivering a unified approach" said Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director general, in a statement.
Over the fireplace at Mingo Creek Craft Distillers, a whiskey purveyor in the small town of Washington, Pennsylvania, a portrait of Alexander Hamilton hangs upside down. With snowy hair and a black velvet jacket, Hamilton wears an impassive look that might be described as hauteur. In 1791, to pay off debts the newly formed United States incurred during the revolutionary war, Hamilton imposed the first federal tax on the people of the region. By taxing their most lucrative product, whiskey, he became what he is here today: a villain representing the excesses of the federal government. The town of Washington is only a six-hour drive from Manhattan, but it’s a world away from the Broadway stage where Hamilton, clad in snug white knickers, enjoys a better reputation.

Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left a demoralized agency where staff fear their ability to protect public health is diminished
Scott Pruitt is out but his impact on the environment will be felt for years
Scott Pruitt, who has finally stepped down as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency after a long-rumbling corruption scandal, rose to public prominence on the back of a series of increasingly outlandish ethical controversies. Scott Pruitt resigns: Trump's scandal-ridden EPA chief steps down Read more
From lobbying fast food company Chick-fil-A on behalf of his wife, to demanding his staff acquire a mattress from a Trump Hotel – not to mention the millions of taxpayer dollars spent on security, first-class travel and soundproof booths – Pruitt’s behavior clashed spectacularly with any pretense of Trump’s pledge to “drain the swamp” in Washington. But the lasting legacy of the former Oklahoma attorney general – who was picked by Trump after crusading against what he called the EPA’s “activist agenda” – is likely to be felt in the systematic weakening of environmental regulations. While not as eye-catching as, for example, his demand that his official vehicle use sirens so he could reach a French restaurant on time, Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left behind a demoralized agency where staff fret that their ability to protect public health has been diminished. A staunch ally of oil and gas companies, Pruitt stacked EPA advisory boards with industry representatives and sought to set aside whole troves of research that link pollution to various illnesses.
Private, non-residential building fell 0.3 percent. Economists are forecasting that construction spending will contribute to overall growth this year even though interest rates are rising. A lack of inventory has stymied homebuyers and pushed home prices higher as demand for existing and new homes has surged. Last month the Commerce Department reported that housing starts rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.35 million, the strongest pace since July 2007, thanks to a surge of building in the Midwest. Even as government budgets have tightened, construction of public projects in May rose 0.7 percent to $304.1 billion, the highest since October 2010.

Local authorities have reached the point where relentless financial cutbacks are putting the wellbeing of vulnerable adults and children at risk, the Conservative leader of the Local Government Association (LGA) has warned. The Tory peer Lord Porter said that after eight years of austerity during which £16bn has been stripped from municipal budgets in England, councils risked being “damaged beyond recognition” and communities depleted of vital services. An £8bn black hole in council budgets would open up by 2023 unless ministers stepped in to close the gap between spiralling demand for adult and children’s social care services and shrinking town hall incomes, he said. “We’ve reached a point where councils will no longer be able to support our residents as they expect, including our most vulnerable,” Porter added. As well as problems coping with demand for services for elderly and disabled adults, the LGA says councils are struggling with an explosion in the number of children in care, and a rising bill for 80,000 homeless families placed in temporary housing.

Small businesses hired workers at a slower pace in June, the second straight month of weakening job gains despite an overall healthy economy. Payroll company ADP said Thursday it counted 29,000 new jobs at its customers with 49 or fewer employees. This marks a decline from small business job gains of 46,000 in May and 50,000 in April. So far this year, small businesses have been creating on average 46,000 jobs a month. ADP reported that overall private employers added 177,00 jobs last month, a slight drop-off from the average this year of 202,667 a month as companies say they're having a tougher time finding skilled workers.

Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday.

He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.

Straight-A students are being turned away from British medical schools and forced to pay for training in Eastern Europe, while the National Health Service (NHS) plunders the Third World for already-trained doctors instead. The Daily Mail spoke to a number of star students who earned top A-levels and supplemented their CVs with spells volunteering at local GP surgeries, overseas clinics, hospices, and pharmacies — and even earned degrees in related fields such as Biomedical Science — who were turned away from British medical schools, despite the NHS facing a shortfall of some 10,000 doctors. Department of Health and Social Care figures show that only 6,000 of 18,000 medical school applicants were awarded places last year — with many of the 6,000 likely going to foreign applicants, who have often been favoured over British applicants. In fact, the Mail found that so many talented would-be medical students were being rejected that a cottage industry of English-language medical schools in countries such as Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Armenia, and Georgia have sprung up to cater to them — but even this option is not available to youngsters who cannot afford the fees.

"We continue to add renewables to our system, but they have to make sense," Burke said. "It's not really about a target, it's about what makes sense for our customers' usage and what makes rates affordable and what keeps our system reliable." Thirty-two states with renewable standards didn't have, on average, a correlated rate increase, according to Wesley Hersche, an associate director of research with Arizona State University's Global Security Initiative. "These issues involve a complex interaction of factors, and we should be careful not to oversimplify things," Hersche wrote in April.

No one was ever arrested for the blaze, although Fieseler writes about how investigators keyed into one main suspect in the fire — a disgruntled bar patron who'd been kicked out earlier in the day and had been heard threatening to burn the place down. It wasn't until 2003 that a plaque commemorating the fire's victims was laid. New Orleans was a conflicted place for the gay community at the time of the fire, Fieseler says. In some ways, the city was a haven for the gay community where people could be themselves. But there were also raids on gay bars, harassment, and discrimination: "An individual who was quiet and who was closeted gay, could find companionship, could find love and joy, could have a job, could have a house, so long as this individual never spoke the dreaded H.

This isn't the first time Cohen has done something Trump-related. The actor interviewed Trump in 2003 for HBO's "Da Ali G Show," where Cohen tried to get him to invest in “an ice cream glove.”
In October 2012, after Cohen's ash stunt, Trump tweeted, "I never fall for scams. I am the only person who immediately walked out of my ‘Ali G’ interview." Trump's scam-dar might be on the fritz: On June 28, former Howard Stern sidekick "Stuttering" John Melendez announced via Twitter that he successfully prank-called President Trumpon Air Force One by impersonating Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), who was acquitted of accepting bribes earlier this year. Melendez added that he'd even passed a phone interview with the president's son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner to suss out what he was calling about (he claimed it was about separating immigrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border).
President Donald Trump is not responsible for the killing of journalists in Annapolis last week. His belittling of the press — his “enemy of the American people” taunts, his promises to roll back libel laws, his fomenting rage toward specific journalists at rallies — is worth mentioning within the context of the murders, because it speaks to a larger concern that last Thursday’s attack on The Capital Gazette won’t be an isolated incident. Journalists, many of whom already risk their lives covering war and violence, many of whom receive death threats regularly, feel understandable jitters about a leader who tries to turn the American public against us, particularly when we watch a member of that public shoot up a newsroom and end five lives. It’s reckless and inaccurate, though, to pin the shootings on Trump. The suspect swore an oath to kill a Capital writer who wrote about him in 2011.
Statements she’s made show that she’s remaining “hopelessly naïve” about pro-lifers’ goals and methods. : Historically, the movement to limit abortion rights has been a net political negative for the right, Will Saletan reports. Republicans may not want to push the issue too far: “When pro-lifers accumulate enough justices to threaten Roe, they scare pro-choicers into voting on the issue.”
Oh please: Liberals are twisting themselves in knots to tie Anthony Kennedy’s retirement to Trumpian corruption, somehow. Mark Joseph Stern thinks it’s just not that complicated.

“While these measures will have impacts on fishers and processors in the local community, the long-term economic risks of not adequately protecting North Atlantic Right Whales are greater,” said Vincent Hughes, a spokesman for Fisheries and Oceans Canada minister Dominic LeBlanc. But Moira Brown, the marine biologist who reported the whale sighting, said temporary fishing bans can do more harm than good. Conservationists like her need the help of fishermen to protect these highly-endangered animals, and heavy-handed, reactionary measures makes them less, not more, likely to cooperate, she said. “This is not an easy issue,” said Brown, who is one of Canada’s top experts on right whales. “I don’t want to lose that long history of working together ... We want to see co-existence.
Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.

Corporate America couldn’t hire Republican lobbyists fast enough after President Donald Trump’s election gave the GOP unified control of Washington. Now there are signs that Democrats are back in demand. Companies and trade groups are trying to hire congressional staffers with ties to influential House Democrats four months ahead of the midterm elections, in which Democrats are expected to pick up seats and potentially retake control of the House. Lobbyists are helping their clients meet with the Democrats who would become committee chairs if the party does win back the chamber. And trade groups are talking to members about what to expect from a Democratic takeover.
Last month, the government said private employers added 218,000 jobs, which was higher than ADP's revised figure of 189,000.
“There are small nations and there are countries that have not yet realised they are small nations.” Witnessing that realisation dawn on this government has been painful to watch; anticipating the consequences for generations to come has been excruciating. So on Friday at Chequers the government will do what it has been doing for the past two years: spend an inordinate amount of time negotiating with itself before producing a “solution” that is unworkable, only to take it to Brussels and discover it is also unacceptable. The problem is not just that they don’t have a rabbit; they don’t even have a hat. Through a series of self-inflicted wounds the Conservative party has reduced itself to this: hovering between delusional and deranged, bluster and buffoonery. Insisting on concessions that have not been offered; suggesting solutions that have already been rejected; showing up to negotiations with nothing to offer; refusing to concede anything, only then to capitulate to everything.
Kinner was being held without bail at the Ada County jail on 15 charges, including six of injury to a child and nine of aggravated battery, jail records showed. There was no lawyer listed for Kinner in the records. Kinner may have wanted to “extract vengeance” for being kicked out by a tenant who took him in, Police Chief Bill Bones said at a press conference on Sunday. The woman who took Kinner in was not harmed and was not at the residence at the time of the attack. Kinner assaulted the children at the party after he was unable to find the woman, police said, adding his motive was still under investigation.
"Jon's record is clear—if it's good for Montana, Jon works with anyone from either party to get things done. If it's bad for Montana, he'll stand up to anyone," Tester spokesman Chris Meagher said. "East Coast developer Matt Rosendale is only looking out for himself and whatever out-of-state special interest group that is propping up his campaign with cash. We can't trust him to defend Montana." But before Trump arrived in Montana, Tester's campaign took out full-page ads in newspapers across the state, highlighting bills the senator sponsored that Trump has signed into law.

And you tell them they’re not welcome anymore, anywhere,” could have been misconstrued because of her excitable manner in which she conveyed her thoughts. However, she explained that her advice was strictly to encourage people to speak out in unison and peacefully gather together whenever and wherever possible — relentlessly, so that their voices are not drowned out by the horrific words of President Donald Trump and his loyal band of followers. Waters actually repeated statements made by Trump that showed he is the one who has demonstrated behavior that could incite violence. Waters’ concerns about the thousands of children separated from their parents in the most cruel way showed through her eyes and passionate words. She called out Trump for who he is, as others should be doing.
The government estimates that 80,000 unemployed workers will lose payments within 12 months of the demerit point system – all for the greater good of reducing “welfare dependency” and unburdening the budget. Given everything we now know about the sharp rise of homelessness in this country, it’s staggering that the Coalition continues to implement social policy that’s specifically designed to chuck vulnerable people off benefits. It’s also staggering how well it’s working – according to the ABS, due to the tightening of eligibility requirements, only 36% of unemployed people receive the dole.

Rather than building a robust safety net, it seems that punishment and coercion have become the key guiding principles of welfare reform. Government rhetoric would have us believe that cutting people off benefits gives them the “motivation” they need to find work (even as all evidence points to the contrary).
Crimes such as robbery remain rampant across Venezuela amid the country’s dire economic and humanitarian crisis, leading growing numbers of people to turn to violence merely to ensure survival. Kidnappings, armed robberies, and violent attacks are now commonplace. Venezuela is widely considered one of the most dangerous destinations in the world. As noted by El Nacional, “There are many travelers who have been stripped of money, luggage, and vehicles on the Caracas-La Guaira highway, especially at night and early morning when the road is little traveled and lacks surveillance.”
The doctors were present in Venezuela as part of an agreement between the two countries. Venezuela typically pays for the doctors in vast quantities of oil, an initiative that started under Hugo Chávez and Fidel Castro.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
Delivering a speech in Newcastle on Thursday, he said: “At the moment, protectionism is largely just talk (and tweets). But what if rhetoric becomes reality?”
Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.

The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year. The prison population has soared by 20% since the 2015 report. Almost half of all prisoners released reoffend and return to prison within two years. “As the government tightens sentencing and bail conditions, and builds more prisons, there is no indication that these trends are likely to change,” Glass said.

A free Interrail ticket for teenagers to discover Europe may sound too good to be true - and for thousands of hopefuls that has proved to be the case. The EU has now closed a controversial lottery that allocated 15,000 free tickets to 18-year-olds; but more than 100,000 applied. The window for applications was 12-26 June. Those lucky enough to get a ticket can spend a month visiting up to four other European countries by rail, between 9 July and 30 September. In future, the European Commission plans to expand the scheme to enable 1.5 million 18-year-olds to visit their European neighbours, funded by €700m (£619m; $815m) of EU money.

Appearing in a state he dominated in 2016, Trump cast Tester as a "liberal Democrat," railing against his voting record on issues like abortion, immigration and taxes. While Tester opposed Trump's first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, and the Republican tax bill, he also took flak from the left for a bill easing the rules on banks. Tester tried to counter Trump's visit by taking out a full-page ad Thursday in more than a dozen newspapers across the state thanking him for signing 16 bills the Democrat sponsored or co-sponsored. Trump rallied in Great Falls to boost the candidacy of Tester's Republican challenger, state Auditor Matt Rosendale, who is seeking to deny Tester a third term and give Montana an all-Republican congressional delegation. The president has made the Montana race a priority as he hopes to help Republicans tighten the party's hold on the Senate.

Starting with his own community, Crowley said he aims to "do more" so others will see education as the first "stoplight" before young boys and girls become more incarcerated criminals. "By doing more, I came to the decision of running for state Senate," he said. "We’ve seen it on Tuesday — people really want to see something done in their community." But Crowley’s most challenging hurdle is a stark reality for all Democrats this cycle: falling voter turnout. A new Pew Research study found that while the youngest generations, including Generation X, Millennials, and the post-Millennial generation, make up of the bulk of eligible voters in 2018, if turnout outcomes from the 2014 midterms persist, they are less inclined to comprise of the majority of voters who cast ballots this November.

EDITOR'S NOTE: This is a weekly look at the latest developments in the South China Sea, the location of several territorial conflicts that have raised tensions in the region. ———
XI ASSERTS TERRITORIAL CLAIMS IN MEETING WITH US DEFENSE SECRETARY
Chinese President Xi Jinping strongly asserted China's determination to defend territory it claims, including in the South China Sea, in a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. While the tone of Mattis' visit to Beijing was largely upbeat, Xi made sure to reinforce his reputation as a fervent nationalist when it comes to issues of sovereignty. Though Xi gave no specifics in his statement, he was largely seen as indicating the South China Sea as well as self-governing Taiwan. China also claims territory held by India and uninhabited East China Sea islands controlled by Japan.
Once the Supreme Court nominee is confirmed by the Senate, the president must issue a written commission to his nominee. Afterward, the nominee needs to be sworn in – taking two oaths of office – before assuming his official position on the nation's highest court. Fox News’ Judson Berger, John Roberts and The Associated Press have contributed to this report.
In what ways should these concerns shape congressional expectations about transparency of the nominee vetting process and the standards for recusal in cases involving President Trump’s legal affairs? Consider first the not-unlikely prospect of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who has developed a robust view of presidential immunity from legal process fully consistent with some of the more aggressive positions of the president and his legal team. Kavanaugh has written that:
Congress might consider a law exempting a President—while in office—from criminal prosecution and investigation, including from questioning by criminal prosecutors or defense counsel. Criminal investigations targeted at or revolving around a President are inevitably politicized by both their supporters and critics. As I have written before, “no Attorney General or special counsel will have the necessary credibility to avoid the inevitable charges that he is politically motivated—whether in favor of the President or against him, depending on the individual leading the investigation and its results.” The indictment and trial of a sitting President, moreover, would cripple the federal government, rendering it unable to function with credibility in either the international or domestic arenas.
Hamilton, the Republican state lawmaker who beat the incumbent Karnes, won with a mix of support from teachers and other unions. While Karnes sparred with teachers during the strike, Hamilton took a moderate position. He aligned with teachers unions by opposing state right-to-work legislation and the proposed repeal of prevailing wage laws for public construction projects. The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.

The report also said that Strzok repeatedly pushed for more aggressive action in the Clinton probe. "The conduct by these employees cast a cloud over the entire FBI investigation and sowed doubt about the FBI’s work," the report concluded. "The damage caused by these employees’ actions extends far beyond the scope of the (Clinton) investigation and goes to the heart of the FBI’s reputation for neutral fact finding and political independence." Goelman, in an op-ed in USA TODAY last month, said Strzok has become the victim of "political gamesmanship" by Congress and President Trump, who has repeatedly tweeted about Strzok as evidence of bias by the FBI and Justice Department. "They have spent months cynically taking these texts out of context and saying that one- or two-word snippets somehow prove that the FBI investigations of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the Russia probe itself, were biased," Goelman wrote.
Health policy experts say one flaw with the administration’s plan is the lack of any serious follow through. | REUTERS Drugmakers defy Trump's call to drop prices
President Donald Trump in May said that drugmakers would soon announce “massive” price cuts, and his administration rolled out a plan to bring down the cost of medicines. But the companies don’t appear to have gotten that message. Bayer raised the price of two cancer drugs by hundreds of dollars in May and Novartis followed by boosting four pricey treatments in June. Pfizer, one of the largest U.S. pharmaceutical companies, announced increases on more than 41 products this week.

A judge ordered federal emergency officials to extend vouchers for temporary hotel housing for nearly 1,700 Puerto Rican hurricane evacuees, saying ending the program could cause irreparable harm. Saturday night's decision came shortly after civil rights group LatinoJustice PRLDEF filed a lawsuit seeking relief for the Puerto Ricans, whose federal housing assistance vouchers were set to expire at midnight Sunday, meaning the evacuees could have been evicted from the hotels. The order says the agency cannot end its Transitional Sheltering Assistance program until at least midnight on Tuesday. The organization is pushing to let families stay another six months. U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin of Massachusetts wrote that ending the program would drain other public resources.
Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease. Two aides who came with him from Oklahoma received massive raises Pruitt was later forced to reverse. He replaced the head of his security detail who wouldn’t let him use lights and sirens to zip around the city like the president. And a top career official was dismissed after he questioned the security justifications for Pruitt’s beefed up, multimillion-dollar protective detail.
Jarzembowski is indeed bitter — the Polish student had to scramble to find a place to live and a new school for his senior year of high school. The seminary in question, located inside a palazzo just a few steps from the Vatican hotel where Francis lives, serves as a residence for about a dozen boys, aged 12 to 18, who serve as altar boys at papal Masses. Jarzembowski says his roommate was first molested by the older seminarian when both were minors, but that the molestation continued after the older seminarian turned 18. The status of the investigation is unclear. Calls and emails to the Diocese of Como, which is in charge of the seminary and is conducting the canonical investigation, were not returned.

The automaker claims it "effectively resolves" the problem. NHTSA has received almost 200 complaints about the issue.
But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said. Tackett said he's concerned about children, especially in Eastern Kentucky, which has a higher rate of Medicaid patients and some of the state's worst oral health. "I have no problem with them regulating the adults that are on Medicaid," Tackett said. "If they are young and healthy, they should be out working or doing something.
“We will not hesitate to take action when we see sanctionable activity and that is consistent with our policy of economic and diplomatic isolation against Iran,” Brian Hook told reporters at a State Department briefing. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images Trump administration on Iran sanctions: 'We will not hesitate' to punish offenders
The Trump administration "will not hesitate” to punish foreign companies that don't comply with sanctions set to be reimposed on Iran in the coming months, a senior State Department official said Monday. The proclamation — and looming penalties — could further escalate tensions with America's longtime allies in Europe that have expressed a desire to continue doing business with Iran. Story Continued Below
Officials from the Treasury Department and State Department have spent the past several weeks meeting with their counterparts around the globe, including in Europe, State Department Director of Policy Planning Brian Hook said, ahead of the reimposition of sanctions in early August. “We will not hesitate to take action when we see sanctionable activity and that is consistent with our policy of economic and diplomatic isolation against Iran,” Hook told reporters at a State Department briefing, before describing the traveling "road shows" U.S. officials are conducting to explain the policy.

As they were looking around, they noticed a moose at the pond and they both said how amazing it would be if that was the backdrop to their wedding photos. Sure enough, just before the couple’s first kiss as husband and wife, they heard something behind them. ‘I start seeing guests kind of looking that way and I’m just wondering what the commotion is and I look over and I see people kind of moving really fast and I see a moose right there.’ Shandy said the moose seemed more curious than aggressive, but everyone, including the pastor, made sure to be cautious of their surroundings.”
AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…
“Yes, I know that the world is going to pieces and that the prowess of three gifted players doesn’t amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. But I remind you that FDR wanted baseball to continue during World War II. I make no claim that elegance and grace on any field will ward off the apocalypse.
Three of the teens were named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit. Howard told U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Dillon during a status conference Tuesday that all three original plaintiffs are no longer part of the case. But he said another teen "is anxious to participate in the case" and will be named as a new plaintiff. "We believe that his allegations with respect to his experience at the facility are sufficiently analogous ... to those of John Does Nos. 1, 2 and 3," Howard said.
“His ruling was closer to congressional talking points than legal precedent.”
Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center, said that the center doesn’t weigh in on potential judicial appointees, but that open hostility to the agency’s mission would be cause for concern. “Obviously, it would be concerning if there was a justice that was inclined to invalidate the CFPB,” she said. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, renamed the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection under acting director Mick Mulvaney, returned nearly $12 billion to 29 million customers of financial services companies from 2011 to 2017 under its original director, Richard Cordray, an Obama appointee and former Ohio attorney general. But the CFPB’s structure — in fact, its very existence — has been a lightning rod since the agency’s inception. Opponents say not making the CFPB subject to the congressional appropriations process — it’s funded directly by the Federal Reserve — gives it unchecked power; supporters counter that having the central bank as its funding source protects the CFPB from partisan-driven attempts to starve it of resources.

Roger Swindells, from the prison's Independent Monitoring Board, cited a number of problems within the jail, including overcrowding, with inmates in the Victorian cells facing cramped conditions with cockroaches and rat infestations.

He said there was also a high sickness rate among officers and problems with staff retention. G4S, which currently runs five of the 14 privately-run jails in the UK, took over the management of the prison in 2011. It promised to "continue to invest" in Birmingham, which holds more than 1,400 inmates.

But Stuart Weddell, who worked at the jail from 1995 until October of last year, said staffing numbers, including among the most experienced staff, had been cut to unsafe levels since the firm took over.
Tweeting Saturday from New Jersey, Trump urged ICE agents to "not worry or lose your spirit" and wrote that "the radical left Dems want you out. Next it will be all police." A number of prominent Democrats have called for the outright elimination of ICE. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York said ICE has "become a deportation force," telling CNN late Thursday "you should get rid of it, start over, reimagine it and build something that actually works." Rep. Mark Pocan, a Democrat from Wisconsin, stated last week that he plans to introduce legislation to eliminate ICE.
In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners. Alas, he is wasting his time trying to shift the views of the Democratic Party, which has become ever more left-wing, if not outright socialist. I think it is time for Mr. James to become a Republican. Guy Randolph

It’s shocking that Mr. James is surprised by the positive economic results of less regulation and lower taxes.

The president told Fox News that he believes his nominee will get some support from Democrats. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, an abortion rights supporter, is considered one of the key votes on a nominee. She said she wouldn't vote for someone who would overturn Roe v. Wade. "A candidate who would overturn Roe would not be acceptable," she said Sunday on ABC's This Week. Collins, who has previously bucked party lines on other key issues such as health care, said she plans to have an in-depth conversation with the nominee.
Watts was transported to a nearby hospital, where 85 to 90 percent of his body was found to have been burned, Georgia State Patrol told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Authorities said Watts, upset with the federal agency designated to aid veterans, attached a homemade incendiary device and fireworks to his body before pouring liquid on himself. He then ignited the fluid. VETERAN PROTESTING TREATMENT BY VA SETS HIMSELF ON FIRE NEAR GEORGIA STATE CAPITOL, POLICE SAY
"It looks like a veteran that was disgruntled with the VA did a personal protest in front of the Capitol which involved gasoline and some fireworks,” Commissioner Mark McDonough, of the Georgia Department of Public Safety, said. The commissioner added a Capitol trooper "actually put him out with his fire extinguisher."
We can’t say we’re enamored of former Gov. Pat Quinn’s campaign to term limit Mayor Rahm Emanuel off the February ballot. But we find ourselves rooting for him anyway. We’re not big fans of term limits. They make lame ducks out of good public servants, who ought to stay in office as long as we can keep them.
Such challenges are a shot across the bow at the administration and DeVos, who is working to redefine a department conceived to advocate for students — not schools or lobbyists seeking financial profits. The debate carries huge significance for U.S. taxpayers, who fund the billions of dollars in student loans and grants DeVos oversees each year. “With Navient bulldozing students on their loans and the Department of Education gone missing in action, California is moving to stop the abuse,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra told NBC News in a statement. The California suit argues that Navient improperly steered financially distressed borrowers — such as single moms and new graduates — into forbearance, costing them thousands of dollars. It specifically targets federal loans that DeVos and Mick Mulvaney, acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, are tasked with policing.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
It is Trump’s responsibility, however, to help the nation heal in the aftermath. So it’s important that he reversed course Tuesday and called for the lowering of American flags in honor of the five victims. Trump initially rebuffed Annapolis Mayor Gavin Buckley’s request over the weekend to lower flags to half-staff. READ MORE: In a time of hate, your civility lectures aren't helping anyone »
“Obviously, I’m disappointed, you know?” Buckley told the Capital Gazette on Monday.
— MINING: The EPA said last year that it won't require mining companies to prove they have the financial resources to clean up pollution, an Obama-era rule stemming from a long history of pollution spilling from abandoned mines into streams. Pruitt said modern mining practices and existing regulations made the financial requirement unnecessary and a burden on mining. — AUTOS: Pruitt's EPA has proposed freezing vehicle fuel-efficiency standards at 2020 levels for the next five years, according to a draft of the proposal obtained by Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del. For new vehicles, that means an average of about 30 miles per gallon instead of rising to 36 mpg by 2025 as Obama's EPA proposed. — OIL AND GAS: More than a dozen states are suing the EPA for failing to take action against leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, from oil and natural gas wells.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.
Anything short of that is selling workers, communities and our collective future short.”
Bishop John Bauerschmidt, who oversees the Middle Tennessee region of the church, stands firmly by his decision not to authorize their use, nor allow clergy within his diocese to officiate the religious ceremonies or permit the weddings on church property. In doing so, the bishop says he is being faithful to his job of guarding the discipline, faith and unity of the church. April 2017: Black female Episcopal bishop of Indy diocese breaks stained glass ceiling

"The teaching that Christian marriage is between a man and a woman is reasonable, traditional, and scriptural," Bauerschmidt said in an email. "There really is nothing remarkable about a Christian bishop who holds to this teaching." While Bishops can place limitations on the use of the marriage liturgies, they must refer couples to a willing diocese if they do not authorize them.

But critics say it also underscores how his "America First" foreign policy at times can seem outright reckless, providing ammunition to America's adversaries. The White House declined to comment on the private conversations. But a National Security Council spokesman reiterated that the U.S. will consider all options at its disposal to help restore Venezuela's democracy and bring stability. Under Trump's leadership, the U.S., Canada and European Union have levied sanctions on dozens of top Venezuelan officials, including Maduro himself, over allegations of corruption, drug trafficking and human rights abuses. The U.S. has also distributed more than $30 million to help Venezuela's neighbors absorb an influx of more than 1 million migrants who have fled the country.
“Some of these articles feature exaggerations or overgeneraliszations [sic]; for example, some claim that China is ‘world No.1’ in certain field.”
The problem with these pieces, the People’s Daily argued in this column, is that “they lack basic facts and deep thought.”
Should Xi implement this reform in the tone of Chinese state media, it would mean a significant change for the typical styles of the nation’s largest publications. In 2017 alone, Chinese state publications proclaimed that the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse scandal proves that “Chinese traditional values” are superior to Western ones; the Soviet Union failed because it lacked “Chinese culture”; and that the West was doomed to fail because Western leaders “always believe in absolute conquest.”
An extensive profile of Xi Jinping in the state outlet Xinhua last year also went out of its way to proclaim that the world is riveted by Xi and his ability to “make things happen,” as evidenced by the “numerous clicks and many thumbs-up on the Internet” his speeches and political commentary garner. The story featured an anecdote about a man who drank some of the ink he was using to translate the Communist Manifesto because “the taste of truth is so sweet.”
Not to be left behind, in December, the People’s Daily proclaimed, “A unique path, a unique theory, a unique system, a unique culture; Xi Jinping’s thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era has developed a rich path for China that has transcended Western-centric theory.”
The growing human rights movement within China has also become one of the most common targets of vitriol for state media. Shortly following the death of Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo last year, the Global Times called Liu and his supporters “losers” and dismissed their lives as a “waste.”
The People’s Daily message this week may be aimed for North Korea as much as it is for China, as Pyongyang prepares for what appears to be inevitable economic profit following dictator Kim Jong-un’s in-person meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. North Korean state media are more vitriolic and exaggerated than their Chinese counterpart, spending much of 2017 threatening a nuclear attack on the United States and sentencing Trump to death.
(Reuters) - A man went on a stabbing spree at a 3-year-old’s birthday party at an apartment complex housing refugee families in Boise on Saturday, injuring nine people, including six children, police said on Sunday. Timmy Kinner, a 30-year-old from Los Angeles who had been staying at the complex, has been arrested, Boise police said. He is not an immigrant and went on the rampage a day after being asked to leave by one of the residents, police said. Kinner was being held without bail at the Ada County jail on 15 charges, including six of injury to a child and nine of aggravated battery, jail records showed. There was no lawyer listed for Kinner in the records.
A judge ordered federal emergency officials to extend vouchers for temporary hotel housing for nearly 1,700 Puerto Rican hurricane evacuees, saying ending the program could cause irreparable harm. Saturday night's decision came shortly after civil rights group LatinoJustice PRLDEF filed a lawsuit seeking relief for the Puerto Ricans, whose federal housing assistance vouchers were set to expire at midnight Sunday, meaning the evacuees could have been evicted from the hotels. The order says the agency cannot end its Transitional Sheltering Assistance program until at least midnight on Tuesday. The organization is pushing to let families stay another six months. U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin of Massachusetts wrote that ending the program would drain other public resources.
A Connecticut man who was assaulted by three juveniles while at work has been sentenced to prison for stabbing one of the attackers. The Connecticut Post reports 21-year-old Jeffrey Sumpter of Bridgeport received 18 months in jail Monday at a Stamford courthouse. The paper reported that Sumpter — who was convicted of felony first-degree assault — also will have to spend three years following his release on probation. If he breaks the law during that time, Sumpter could be made to serve all or part of a 42-month prison sentence. Sumpter was working at a Dunkin’ Donuts in Norwalk last October when he was jumped by three males.
President Donald Trump is not responsible for the killing of journalists in Annapolis last week. His belittling of the press — his “enemy of the American people” taunts, his promises to roll back libel laws, his fomenting rage toward specific journalists at rallies — is worth mentioning within the context of the murders, because it speaks to a larger concern that last Thursday’s attack on The Capital Gazette won’t be an isolated incident. Journalists, many of whom already risk their lives covering war and violence, many of whom receive death threats regularly, feel understandable jitters about a leader who tries to turn the American public against us, particularly when we watch a member of that public shoot up a newsroom and end five lives. It’s reckless and inaccurate, though, to pin the shootings on Trump. The suspect swore an oath to kill a Capital writer who wrote about him in 2011.
I look very much forward to working with him. There is much to be done that will benefit both the United States and Mexico! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 2, 2018
“I think he’s gonna try and help us with border,” Trump told the reporters. He described “unbelievably bad border laws, immigration laws” in the United States, calling them “the weakest in the world, laughed at by everybody in the world.” He contrasted the U.S. immigration laws with “Mexico’s very strong immigration laws.”
Trump suggested that Mexico can help the United States “until we straighten out our immigration laws, which have been bad for many, many years, decades.” He further assured, “We’re gonna have them taken care of.”

The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. Teachers are also running a ballot measure campaign that would tax the highest income earners for an additional $690 million to spend on schools. “Regardless of political parties, we need people to make a decision about what’s happening in the classroom,” said Marisol Garcia, vice president of the Arizona Education Association. “To limit ourselves and to say ‘only these people are going to support us’ is just not true.”
Teachers can be at a disadvantage compared to wealthier candidates, who tend to have built-in networks of potential donors.
Nebraska May Join Utah, Idaho in Putting Medicaid Expansion Before Voters
Enlarge this image toggle caption Fred Knapp/NET News Fred Knapp/NET News
Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.

While other data on Thursday showed private payrolls rising less than expected last month and a surprise increase in new applications for unemployment benefits last week, overall labor market conditions continue to tighten. The labor market is considered to be near or at full employment, with the jobless rate at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent. The unemployment rate has dropped by three-tenths of a percentage point this year and is near the Federal Reserve’s forecast of 3.6 percent by the end of this year.
A helicopter trip to a hospital may not be the only shock a patient faces after a bad accident. The next one could hit when the bill arrives. Rides in so-called air ambulances can lead to bills of more than $20,000 depending on a person's coverage, and insurance experts say big invoices are becoming more common as costs rise and coverage shifts. Air ambulances transport around 400,000 people each year in the U.S., according to industry estimates. Most trips are from one hospital to another.

"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.

Even Pruitt’s own staff had begun to sour on him, with many worrying that their future career prospects would be damaged by their association with Pruitt’s tenure. Each scandal seemed more damning than the last. Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.

That came on the heels of 0.9 percent drop in March, the first monthly drop since July of 2017. Total private construction rose 0.3 percent, with residential projects up 0.8 percent in May. New single-family home construction rose 0.6 percent and the volatile apartment building sector jumped 1.6 percent. Private, non-residential building fell 0.3 percent. Economists are forecasting that construction spending will contribute to overall growth this year even though interest rates are rising.

In what ways should these concerns shape congressional expectations about transparency of the nominee vetting process and the standards for recusal in cases involving President Trump’s legal affairs? Consider first the not-unlikely prospect of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who has developed a robust view of presidential immunity from legal process fully consistent with some of the more aggressive positions of the president and his legal team. Kavanaugh has written that:
Congress might consider a law exempting a President—while in office—from criminal prosecution and investigation, including from questioning by criminal prosecutors or defense counsel. Criminal investigations targeted at or revolving around a President are inevitably politicized by both their supporters and critics. As I have written before, “no Attorney General or special counsel will have the necessary credibility to avoid the inevitable charges that he is politically motivated—whether in favor of the President or against him, depending on the individual leading the investigation and its results.” The indictment and trial of a sitting President, moreover, would cripple the federal government, rendering it unable to function with credibility in either the international or domestic arenas.

Pentagon Questioned Over Blackout On War Zone Troop Numbers
Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images
For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.

Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
The report also said that Strzok repeatedly pushed for more aggressive action in the Clinton probe. "The conduct by these employees cast a cloud over the entire FBI investigation and sowed doubt about the FBI’s work," the report concluded. "The damage caused by these employees’ actions extends far beyond the scope of the (Clinton) investigation and goes to the heart of the FBI’s reputation for neutral fact finding and political independence." Goelman, in an op-ed in USA TODAY last month, said Strzok has become the victim of "political gamesmanship" by Congress and President Trump, who has repeatedly tweeted about Strzok as evidence of bias by the FBI and Justice Department. "They have spent months cynically taking these texts out of context and saying that one- or two-word snippets somehow prove that the FBI investigations of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the Russia probe itself, were biased," Goelman wrote.

Hall apologised, saying it was a “silly thing to say and not a reflection of who I am ... I have nothing but respect for women”. Gee, we’ve heard that before. Nothing but respect for women. Leyonhjelm won’t even say sorry, can’t even see that saying “men should stop raping women” is not comparable to “all men are rapists”.
"Any notion that prostitution websites introduce 'safety' to the sex trade by making procurement visible is a dangerous and misleading fallacy. "They hide sexual exploitation in plain sight." Sarah Champion - the Labour MP for Rotherham - will lead a follow-up debate in Westminster Hall. "Across the UK, men are paying to sexually exploit vulnerable women and girls that they have 'shopped' for online," she will say. "We need to join the dots - between prostitution, modern slavery, trafficking and child sexual exploitation."
Sen. Susan Collins speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, June 21. | AP Photo Collins: New justice should not favor overturning Roe v. Wade
Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Sunday that President Donald Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court should not seek to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that enshrined abortion rights in the United States. “Roe v. Wade is a constitutional right that is well-established,” Collins said on “State of the Union” on CNN. “And no less an authority than Chief Justice [John] Roberts said that repeatedly at his confirmation hearing.“
Story Continued Below
Trump last week said he wouldn’t ask potential Supreme Court nominees about abortion rights — a departure from his stance on the campaign trail, when he said he would only nominate justices to the Supreme Court who oppose abortion. “I think what he said as the candidate may not have been informed by the legal advice that he now has,” Collins told Jake Tapper.
Federal Reserve officials last month said they expect to keep raising interest rates and suggested that by the next year, they could be high enough that they could start slowing growth, according to minutes of their discussion released Thursday. While noting a strong economy, Fed officials appeared vigilant about emerging risks, especially trade tensions, and the dangers of an economy that might overheat. The officials noted heightened concerns from businesses about President Donald Trump's get-tough trade policies and that some executives had already scaled back future spending plans because of the uncertainty. They also said they were monitoring changes in market-set interest rates. A narrowing in the gap between short-term and long-term rates has been an accurate predictor of downturns in the past.
Corporate America couldn’t hire Republican lobbyists fast enough after President Donald Trump’s election gave the GOP unified control of Washington. Now there are signs that Democrats are back in demand. Companies and trade groups are trying to hire congressional staffers with ties to influential House Democrats four months ahead of the midterm elections, in which Democrats are expected to pick up seats and potentially retake control of the House. Lobbyists are helping their clients meet with the Democrats who would become committee chairs if the party does win back the chamber. And trade groups are talking to members about what to expect from a Democratic takeover.
The Republican Party is rotting away. The problem is that GOP policies just aren’t popular. Most Americans unsurprisingly oppose climate denial, tax cuts for the wealthy, and putting children (including toddlers) in concentration camps, for example. The Republican Party has thus far managed to continue winning elections by creating “a coalition between racists and plutocrats,” as Paul Krugman put it. The party’s economic policies are aimed at benefitting wealthy individuals and corporations, but that’s a slim segment of the American electorate.
Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. LONDON — Over the past century American and British troops have fought side-by-side in two World Wars, Korea and the conflicts in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan. But some lawmakers and experts in the United Kingdom are warning that the British military could soon be seen as irrelevant by the United States unless it receives a colossal funding boost. "There is a concern that the U.K. is falling ever further behind and becoming even more useless from a U.S. point of view," said Andrew Dorman, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a think tank in London.
Tehran, however, accused the group's own members of staging an attack on itself to damage Iran's attempts at savaging its nuclear deal. Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the landmark sanctions relief deal in May, despite protests by his European allies. Iranian officials are now attempting to convince the other signatories - China, France, Germany, the EU, Russia, and the UK - to remain committed to the deal. Assadollah A is in the hands of German police, and a European arrest warrant has been issued for him.
Nebraska May Join Utah, Idaho in Putting Medicaid Expansion Before Voters
Enlarge this image toggle caption Fred Knapp/NET News Fred Knapp/NET News
Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.
“There is nothing in their background to suggest that at all.”

Police have cordoned off at least five areas, including a park, a church and a pharmacy, where the couple had been before they became sick. Officials said people who had been in the areas around where the pair had been before collapsing should wash their clothes, although they insisted risk of contamination was minimal. The pair is now being treated in the same hospital where Skripal and his daughter spent weeks in critical condition following the attack, which London blamed on Moscow.
President Trump had suggested lifting the prohibition, which environmentalists charge would raise levels of ground ozone during warmer months, during his campaign for the White House. Following the news of Mr. Pruitt’s resignation, Mr. Dinneen wrote that there was a “collective sigh of relief coming from the Midwest,” calling the 2019 ethanol quotas “the straw that broke the camel’s back.”
While it is too early to say how the handling of waivers or the treatment of E15 may change under new leadership, one indicator was small losses in affected refiners in early Friday trading and gains in most ethanol producers. CVR Refining, Andeavor and Delek U.S. Holdings , all of which benefited from waivers granted by the EPA, had rallied by 136%, 40% and 92% in the year ended Thursday, respectively. Ethanol companies Pacific Ethanol and Green Plains had fallen by 60% and 14%, respectively. Agricultural lobbyists often portray any easing of the rules as a sop to “big oil,” but that isn’t accurate.
In an 1873 interview with the Pike County Republican newspaper, Madison Hemings, thesecond son of Thomas Jefferson and his slave Sally Hemings, told a story. It was a story that would confirm the decades of rumors that had circulated since Jefferson ran for president in 1801. Madison Hemings began his recollection of his parent’s taboo relationship with these words:
"But during that time (in Paris) my mother became Mr. Jefferson's concubine, and when he was called back home she was [pregnant] by him. He desired to bring my mother back to Virginia with him, but she demurred.
"The president of the republic and his government will be absolutely respectful and support the authorities that are elected," Pena Nieto told reporters. Hovering over the election is the specter of vote fraud, though electoral officials deny it is a possibility with the modern balloting technology and institutions now in place. In both of Lopez Obrador's previous two presidential losses he alleged fraud. In his first loss — by a mere 0.56 percent to conservative Felipe Calderon in 2006 — his supporters held months-long protests in Mexico City and he referred to himself as "the legitimate president." His allies are warning even before Sunday's presidential vote that there better not be any funny business.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
He aligned himself with most of his Democratic colleagues against Gina Haspel, Trump's pick for CIA director, arguing that her record on enhanced interrogation techniques was unacceptable. And instead of focusing on a politically safe issue in his maiden Senate floor speech, Jones struck a nerve by calling for a dialogue on gun violence after the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida. In addition, during the campaign, Jones made no secret of his desire to protect LGBTQ rights and to support a woman's right to abortion. It's those kinds of positions that have made him a darling of Alabama's progressive minority — and somewhat of a public enemy among the state's conservative majority. Jones has introduced four pieces of legislation — none of any huge significance — since he arrived on Capitol Hill, including two agriculture bills, one that would expand access to capital for rural job creators and the last seeking to mandate an annual Medicaid expansion review.
North Korea is believed to be constructing an operational nuclear-armed ballistic missile submarine, and U.S. intelligence officials believe the rogue regime is deliberately “deceiving” Washington -- even as Pyongyang says it seeks peace and denuclearization. South Korea believes the North is working on the submarine on its east coast, Kim Hack-yong, a South Korean lawmaker who was at the helm of the legislature’s defense committee until his term ended a few weeks ago, told The Wall Street Journal on Friday. Kim cited intelligence reports he's viewed to support the claim. Satellite images revealed workers and materials moving at the port of Sinpo, Kim said. The construction is reportedly being done at an indoor facility.
No one was ever arrested for the blaze, although Fieseler writes about how investigators keyed into one main suspect in the fire — a disgruntled bar patron who'd been kicked out earlier in the day and had been heard threatening to burn the place down. It wasn't until 2003 that a plaque commemorating the fire's victims was laid. New Orleans was a conflicted place for the gay community at the time of the fire, Fieseler says. In some ways, the city was a haven for the gay community where people could be themselves. But there were also raids on gay bars, harassment, and discrimination: "An individual who was quiet and who was closeted gay, could find companionship, could find love and joy, could have a job, could have a house, so long as this individual never spoke the dreaded H.
“We are not going to fight. We are always going to seek for there to be an agreement. … We are going to extend our frank hand to seek a relation of friendship, I repeat, of cooperation with the United States.”
Trump was equally tactful, telling reporters: “I think he’s going to try and help us with the border. “I think the relationship will be a very good one,” the US president said of the Mexican politician, whose swearing-in will be in December. “We talked about trade, we talked about Nafta, we talked about a separate deal, just Mexico and the United States.”
Such restraint contrasted with Trump’s call to López Obrador’s predecessor, weeks after his inauguration last year.
The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks picked up 1.1 percent to 1,679.48. Benchmark U.S. crude added 9 cents to $73.03 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

It slid 85 cents, or 1.1 percent, to close at $77.39 per barrel on Thursday.
And in that he is correct. He was also fairly popular as mayor and ended his term with a very respectable approval rating. If he governs as he governed Mexico City, I think things will go well. What worries me here is the magnitude of his promises.

The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives. At first there was talk about a much bigger pot of money -- $100 million or more. When the bill was reintroduced this year, the amount was $20 million. By the end of the legislative session, it was down to $5 million.
They opened “Corruption Park” at a botanical garden in the capital, Kiev. Visitors have explored finery from the depths of Ukrainian greed and graft — a $46,000 crystal falcon, a $300,000 limited edition BMW and a replica of a $9 million chandelier. Which raises the question: Why can’t Illinois have its own Corruption Park? If any locale deserves to display the baubles that come from bribes and other crimes, it’s Illinois, the much-cheated State of Corruption. Envision the park as a perpetual reminder to watch our public officials like a hawk.
That will allow Trump to argue that his tough approach to trade is paying off. There are reasons why the US economy is currently strong, but none of them have anything to do with tariffs on imports. In part, it is the lagged effect of a buoyant global economy in 2017; in part it is explained by tax cuts and the stimulus still being provided by only gently rising interest rates. Mickey Levy, chief US economist for Berenberg, says Trump’s deregulation agenda has been a factor in boosting America’s underlying growth rate. Evidence from Barack Obama’s presidency shows how protectionist policies can backfire.

Hamilton, the Republican state lawmaker who beat the incumbent Karnes, won with a mix of support from teachers and other unions. While Karnes sparred with teachers during the strike, Hamilton took a moderate position. He aligned with teachers unions by opposing state right-to-work legislation and the proposed repeal of prevailing wage laws for public construction projects. The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.
These numbers are similar to those from a February Quinnipiac poll, where 49 percent of voters said Trump was racist and 46 percent said he was not. Forty-four percent of voters said they think “racist beliefs” were a motive in Trump’s immigration policy, while 50 percent said Trump has “a sincere interest in controlling our borders.” Sixty percent said the policy of separating children from their parents at the border was a violation of human rights. Since enacting the policy, Trump and his associates have repeatedly pushed false, racist narratives to garner support, often associating immigration with high crime rates despite no evidence to support claims that immigrants commit more crime than U.S. citizens. While only 11 percent of Republican voters in the Quinnipiac poll said they think Trump is a racist, 22 percent said they believe Trump has emboldened racist people to express their beliefs publicly. The number of hate crimes rose the year Trump was elected ― the first increase in over a decade.
About four years ago, Dais had lined up a Chinese company to help develop its business in nanotechnology that helps produce clean water. Tangredi said the Chinese company persuaded a long-time Dais employee to defect with trade secrets. "They just stole it, and they are using it against us," he said. Tangredi said he hopes the threat of a trade war will force China to rethink its practices: "You've got to do something to get their attention."
He said he supports the project and wants to see it succeed “more than anybody.”

Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) trashed the June jobs report — even though it showed rapid job growth, rising wages, and low unemployment. The report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that employers created 213,000 new jobs in June — 22,000 more than economists had expected. Manufacturing jobs in particular rose by 36,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.

The town, about 32km (20 miles) from Mexico City, is known as the country's pyrotechnic capital. A market in the town has twice been badly damaged by explosions. More than 40 people died in blasts there in 2016.

"It's not a unique business," Troia said. "In this case, they just got caught with the door open." Two days after news of that leak broke, a data breach at the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training at Texas State University exposed the personal information of thousands of law enforcement officers. In that case, which was first reported by ZDNet, the personal info was stored on an unsecured web server, a university spokesman told CNNMoney. Data breaches can happen to anyone, of course -- just ask Equifax (EFX), which experienced a hack that exposed the personal information of over 147 million people last fall.
These numbers are similar to those from a February Quinnipiac poll, where 49 percent of voters said Trump was racist and 46 percent said he was not. Forty-four percent of voters said they think “racist beliefs” were a motive in Trump’s immigration policy, while 50 percent said Trump has “a sincere interest in controlling our borders.” Sixty percent said the policy of separating children from their parents at the border was a violation of human rights. Since enacting the policy, Trump and his associates have repeatedly pushed false, racist narratives to garner support, often associating immigration with high crime rates despite no evidence to support claims that immigrants commit more crime than U.S. citizens. While only 11 percent of Republican voters in the Quinnipiac poll said they think Trump is a racist, 22 percent said they believe Trump has emboldened racist people to express their beliefs publicly. The number of hate crimes rose the year Trump was elected ― the first increase in over a decade.
She worried that giving birth to this child would leave her so tainted that no man would ever want her as his wife. In a panic, she told her mother, who swiftly took her to a clinic for an abortion. But A was so frightened by the doctor's description of possible side effects that she thought she would die. And so she retreated to her shelter, where she tried to flatten her growing belly by wrapping it in tight layers of scarves. She hid there for months, emerging only to use the latrine a few meters away.
In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners. Alas, he is wasting his time trying to shift the views of the Democratic Party, which has become ever more left-wing, if not outright socialist. I think it is time for Mr. James to become a Republican. Guy Randolph

It’s shocking that Mr. James is surprised by the positive economic results of less regulation and lower taxes.
Any amount of prescription opioid use was correlated with greater involvement. Among people with prescription opioid use disorder, nearly 20 percent had criminal justice involvement. For heroin users, it was 40 percent. "People who use opioids, including heroin, were up to 13 times more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system," says Winkelman. The study shows the complexity of the the opioid crisis, according to Josiah Rich, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Brown University, who wasn't involved in the research.
If you look at his high school yearbook, it said he wanted to be a lawyer. But I think he got involved with various movements, and that was more important to him at the time. And then he finally went back to school. GROSS: Was it hard for him to keep the lights on while he was in school? RILEY: I know that we were at various times on food stamps, and yeah.
Many high-priced commercial parcels were under-assessed, pushing more of the tax burden onto smaller businesses and homeowners, the series concluded. Berrios’ office disputes that there are problems with commercial property assessments, the consultants haven’t been asked to work on the issue, and County Board President Toni Preckwinkle has said it would have to be addressed later. Kaegi, who is poised to take office in early December, said the issue “is something that we’re going to take a very close look at from the outset.” Tax hike coming? The assessor’s office conducts a major reassessment of all properties in the county over a three-year period, dividing up the geography by the north suburbs, south suburbs and the city. This year, the city is under review.
"Jon's record is clear—if it's good for Montana, Jon works with anyone from either party to get things done. If it's bad for Montana, he'll stand up to anyone," Tester spokesman Chris Meagher said. "East Coast developer Matt Rosendale is only looking out for himself and whatever out-of-state special interest group that is propping up his campaign with cash. We can't trust him to defend Montana." But before Trump arrived in Montana, Tester's campaign took out full-page ads in newspapers across the state, highlighting bills the senator sponsored that Trump has signed into law.

Public support for abortion rights “remains as high as it has been in two decades of polling”, according to Pew Research, with 57% “saying abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 40% say it should be illegal in all or most cases”. “It’s clear that Donald Trump seeks to put forward a narrow-minded elitist who will protect corporations, the wealthy and the powerful, and individuals who will dismantle Roe, take away critical rights of LGBT Americans and eliminate healthcare for millions of people,” said Goldberg, referring to Roe v Wade, the 1973 decision protecting abortion rights. “All of these rights have been hard-won over decades, and it’s no exaggeration to say the right wants to put on the bench an individual that will turn the clock back.”

In rulings on issues such as workplace arbitration, sexual harassment, voting rights, consumer rights and civil rights, the court could have a particuilar impact on society’s most vulnerable. “I think the reality is that the court’s influence on everyday lives is felt most directly by those who tend to depend upon government, those who may not be in a socio-economic position to adequately vindicate their own rights without some government assistance,” said Vladeck.

Bishop John Bauerschmidt, who oversees the Middle Tennessee region of the church, stands firmly by his decision not to authorize their use, nor allow clergy within his diocese to officiate the religious ceremonies or permit the weddings on church property. In doing so, the bishop says he is being faithful to his job of guarding the discipline, faith and unity of the church.

"The teaching that Christian marriage is between a man and a woman is reasonable, traditional, and scriptural," Bauerschmidt said in an email. "There really is nothing remarkable about a Christian bishop who holds to this teaching." While Bishops can place limitations on the use of the marriage liturgies, they must refer couples to a willing diocese if they do not authorize them.
Among those reported to be among the top of President Donald Trump’s short list is Judge Brett Kavanaugh on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The prospect of a Justice Kavanaugh worries some consumer advocates, who say he has taken an activist position against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the regulator implemented in the wake of the Great Recession in the hopes of thwarting future financial meltdowns. “Kavanaugh’s track record has shown tremendous sympathy to political rhetoric, more so than to established precedent as it relates to the Bureau,” said Aaron Klein, director of the Center on Regulation and Markets at the Brookings Institution. “His ruling was closer to congressional talking points than legal precedent.”
Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center, said that the center doesn’t weigh in on potential judicial appointees, but that open hostility to the agency’s mission would be cause for concern. “Obviously, it would be concerning if there was a justice that was inclined to invalidate the CFPB,” she said.

An IPO market that was left for dead just two years ago has come roaring back in 2018, with companies raising public capital at a pace rarely seen in the past two decades. So far this year, 120 companies have used initial public offerings to raise $35.2 billion on U.S. exchanges. That is the highest volume since 2012 and the fourth-busiest year-to-date on record, according to Dealogic, whose data go back to 1995.

The report also said that Strzok repeatedly pushed for more aggressive action in the Clinton probe. "The conduct by these employees cast a cloud over the entire FBI investigation and sowed doubt about the FBI’s work," the report concluded. "The damage caused by these employees’ actions extends far beyond the scope of the (Clinton) investigation and goes to the heart of the FBI’s reputation for neutral fact finding and political independence." Goelman, in an op-ed in USA TODAY last month, said Strzok has become the victim of "political gamesmanship" by Congress and President Trump, who has repeatedly tweeted about Strzok as evidence of bias by the FBI and Justice Department. "They have spent months cynically taking these texts out of context and saying that one- or two-word snippets somehow prove that the FBI investigations of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the Russia probe itself, were biased," Goelman wrote.

This animation shows how money allegedly misappropriated from 1MDB moved through global wealth centers before being used to buy real estate, art, and other assets around the world, including in New York and Beverley Hills. Illustration: Oliver Osborne for The Wall Street Journal. The U.S. Justice Department, via its civil lawsuits, is attempting to seize almost $2 billion in assets allegedly bought with 1MDB money. However, in August, the department asked a U.S. judge to suspend those cases while it focused on building a criminal investigation into 1MDB, which people familiar with the matter say is focusing on Mr. Low. Mr. Najib launched the 1MDB fund in 2009 as a way to spur investment in Malaysia, but it quickly racked up debts that now stand at $8 billion.
"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.

WASHINGTON – If it's a holiday, it must be time for President Donald Trump to hit the golf course. Right on schedule, the presidential motorcade arrived at the Trump National Golf Club in suburban Virginia in the late morning, the middle of a day that also has the president tweeting and hosting a military-themed picnic later at the White House. As he departed the presidential mansion in the morning, Trump took to Twitter. In addition to a general salutation – "Happy Fourth of July....Our Country is doing GREAT!"
Hill denied the allegations in an emailed statement to IndyStar. Details of the accusations are outlined in a confidential June 18 memorandum prepared by the Taft Stettinius & Hollister law firm at the request of legislative leaders.

Tory differences over UK's post-Brexit future spill into the open Read more
The Labour leader has said the result of the 2016 vote should be respected, but his frontbenchers have been careful not to explicitly rule out a second referendum if the circumstances change. Earlier in the day, Len McCluskey, Unite’s general secretary, said May’s government had lost all authority or capacity to make decisions. “We are not, I repeat for my friends in the media, not, calling for a second referendum … But we remain open to the possibility of a vote on any deal the Tories come back with,” he said. “These people see in Brexit the chance to turn Britain into the low-wage, deregulated, race-to-the-bottom society of their dreams. But Brexit is turning into a nightmare for the rest of us – a nightmare of uncertainty above all.
It was no surprise to read that the very first lesson you suggest could be learned from overseas (Five things the NHS could do to improve service, 3 July) is the establishment of integrated health and social care, as has happened in New Zealand. The achievements of the Attlee government are at the heart of my socialist beliefs but the compromises which led then to the split between free NHS care and means-tested social care remain the achilles heel as the NHS celebrates 70 years. It is utterly ludicrous to have separate systems which imply distinct and neat boundaries between health and care, with rather a lot of people making a good living arguing on which side of the fence some poor demented soul belongs. Disputes around the funding of continuing care have become a major industry. The recent NHS funding announcement, making no reference whatsoever to social care, evidenced the fact that the government still hasn’t the least idea of how the two are umbilically linked.

LONDON — Over the past century American and British troops have fought side-by-side in two World Wars, Korea and the conflicts in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan. But some lawmakers and experts in the United Kingdom are warning that the British military could soon be seen as irrelevant by the United States unless it receives a colossal funding boost. "There is a concern that the U.K. is falling ever further behind and becoming even more useless from a U.S. point of view," said Andrew Dorman, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a think tank in London.
Lopez Obrador, 64, would be the first leftist president in decades in Mexico, Latin America’s No. 2 economy, if he ousts the ruling centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Runner-up in the 2006 and 2012 elections, he pitched himself as the only man capable of cleaning up a political class whose credibility has been ground down by graft, years of subpar economic growth and soaring crime levels. Since the race began late last year, at least 133 politicians have been murdered from all the major parties. The crimes are mostly attributed to gangs trying to influence municipal elections.

He then asked to meet in person to discuss another plan he had for an attack in Philadelphia, and the next day, showed the FBI employee a map with landmarks that he considered worthy bombing targets in that city, according to the affidavit. The undercover employee showed Pitts a device the two had discussed previously - a remote control car containing C-4, according to the affidavit. Pitts told the undercover employee the device could be rolled under a police car, or given to the children of military personnel to play with at a parade, "so that the children would unwittingly detonate the bombs," according to the affidavit. A defense attorney for Pitts could not immediately be located. A fireworks display is still planned in Cleveland for July 4, and U.S. Attorney Justice Herdman urged residents not to be deterred from going by someone who "wanted to strike at the values that are at the very core of our nation."

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections.

Just hours after his historic election victory sent thousands of supporters pouring on to the streets, the 64-year-old leftist tweeted that he had received a call from Donald Trump. “I proposed that we explore an integral agreement of development projects, which generate jobs in Mexico and with that reduce migration and improve security. There was respectful treatment and our representatives will speak more.”
In an interview with the Televisa news network, López Obrador emphasized the need for mutual respect and cooperation between the two neighbors. “We are conscious of the need to maintain good relations with the United States. We have a border of more than 3,000 kilometers, more than 12 million Mexicans live in the United States.
Most were in their twenties, and some were couples, but otherwise, they fit no single profile. Only a little information about their fate has trickled out from the secretive North Korean regime. The full explanation of why they were taken remains a mystery.

Only about 100,000 of the United States' 11.1 million immigrants in the country illegally were from Canada, according to the Pew Research Center in 2014. The maritime boat checks come amid some of the most strained relations between the United States and Canada in decades. President Donald Trump's duties on Canadian steel and aluminum, announced in May, were met with in-kind tariffs on billions of dollars worth of American goods. The trade dispute started in earnest after Trump tweeted that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was acting "meek and mild" and was being dishonest about Canada's trade barriers during the Group of 7 summit last month in Charlevoix, Quebec.

Jon Tester, D-Mont., in November. "Hey, @realDonaldTrump: While you obsess over my genes, your Admin is conducting DNA tests on little kids because you ripped them from their mamas & you are too incompetent to reunite them in time to meet a court order," Warren wrote.

Young estimates that around two-thirds of his union members were Trump supporters. That makes sense: It’s a law enforcement agency that leans white and male (72 percent male, 62 percent white), and many federal prisons are in rural parts of the country, which Trump dominated. But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau.

Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) trashed the June jobs report — even though it showed rapid job growth, rising wages, and low unemployment. The report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that employers created 213,000 new jobs in June — 22,000 more than economists had expected. Manufacturing jobs in particular rose by 36,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.

Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, one of the most powerful conservatives in Congress, has denied reports that he ignored the alleged sexual abuse of athletes while he worked as an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University more than 20 years ago. Allegations that Jordan was aware of sexual misconduct and explicitly was informed of specific incidents of alleged assault by the wrestling team's doctor, first surfaced in an NBC news story on Tuesday. But Jordan — who was an assistant coach from 1987 until 1995, when he was elected to the state legislature — has refuted the claims. "Congressman Jordan never saw any abuse, never heard about any abuse, and never had any abuse reported to him during his time as a coach at Ohio State," Ian Fury, Jordan's spokesman, said in a statement. "He has not been contacted by investigators about the matter but will assist them in any way they ask, because if what is alleged is true, the victims deserve a full investigation and justice."Rep.

— MINING: The EPA said last year that it won't require mining companies to prove they have the financial resources to clean up pollution, an Obama-era rule stemming from a long history of pollution spilling from abandoned mines into streams. Pruitt said modern mining practices and existing regulations made the financial requirement unnecessary and a burden on mining. — AUTOS: Pruitt's EPA has proposed freezing vehicle fuel-efficiency standards at 2020 levels for the next five years, according to a draft of the proposal obtained by Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del. For new vehicles, that means an average of about 30 miles per gallon instead of rising to 36 mpg by 2025 as Obama's EPA proposed. — OIL AND GAS: More than a dozen states are suing the EPA for failing to take action against leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, from oil and natural gas wells.

Because it is also a flood plain, the project’s 989,000 solar panels will be mounted on frames 12ft tall – the height of a double-decker bus. Unlike most solar farms, Cleve Hill Solar Park’s panels will not all face south, but east and west in a continuous zig-zag. The effect, say the scheme’s opponents, will be to turn green meadows into something resembling a colossal factory roof. Economically and environmentally the scheme makes no sense whatsoever. Apart from ruining a huge swathe of countryside and killing or displacing all the local wildlife, it will do little for Britain’s energy needs.
It's difficult to imagine Old Hickory, as he was known, excusing himself from military duty on the grounds that he could not march long distances, as Mr Trump did during the Vietnam War, citing bone spurs. The parallels between the 45th president and the 13th - unlucky for some - are arguably more compelling. Fillmore launched his career in the 1820s with the Anti-Masonic Party, hawking a paranoid rumour that ruling Freemasons were murdering whistleblowers. Mr Trump paved the way for his White House bid by peddling a conspiracy theory, too - that President Barack Obama was not a US citizen.

Fillmore later joined the Whig Party at a time of mounting hostility to refugees from famine, rebellion and tyranny who were arriving by the shipload at the gates of the New World.
In their statement, Mr Netanyahu and Mr Morawiecki praised the Polish wartime government-in-exile, saying it tried to "raise awareness among Western allies of the systematic murder" of Polish Jews. They also said structures of the Polish underground state supervised by the Polish government-in-exile "created a mechanism of systematic help and support to Jewish people". However Yad Vashem said this contradicted decades of historical research and contained "grave errors and deceptions". It said much of the Polish resistance in its various movements "not only failed to help Jews, but was also not infrequently actively involved in persecuting them". Polish assistance to Jews during the Holocaust was "relatively rare", Yad Vashem said, and "attacks against and even the murder of Jews were widespread".

Nielsen founded her own consulting firm, called Sunesis Consulting; she brought on a Bush administration colleague, Elizabeth Neumann, as managing partner, and eventually expanded the suburban Washington firm to 15 people. She continued consulting on cybersecurity issues, becoming a senior fellow at The George Washington University’s Center for Cyber & Homeland Security, and working on reports and presentations on that issue and others for the World Economic Forum—the Swiss nonprofit that puts on an annual summit for global economic heavyweights in Davos, Switzerland. ***
While still running her own consulting firm in late 2016, Nielsen volunteered to advise the Trump transition team on homeland security policy. She met John Kelly during that time, and he tapped her to assist him—also as a volunteer—in his confirmation process for DHS secretary.
Teddy Roosevelt hopped on whistle stop tour after whistle stop tour where he was able to drop into rural and suburban communities alike to deliver short, pre-packaged speeches that local papers would usually print verbatim. (He left them short on purpose for that very reason.) Franklin Roosevelt revolutionized and heightened the stature of the office with his fireside chats, that brought his message over the heads of the pesky press corps and directly into the living rooms of the American people. But, though it would have been seen as a scoop, even the reporters covering Lyndon B. Johnson had the good sense not to report on every turd he dropped in their presence. While the founders envisioned a government that moved slowly and methodically, today’s Wi-Fi-enabled political discourse is demanding the opposite.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass.

The nonpartisan Cook Political Report says Democrats are "likely" to carry Montana in the Senate race. Inside Elections rates the contest as one that "tilts Democratic." After the rally, the spokesman for Tester's re-election campaign put out a statement that was critical of Rosendale but which did not mention the president. "Jon's record is clear—if it's good for Montana, Jon works with anyone from either party to get things done. If it's bad for Montana, he'll stand up to anyone," Tester spokesman Chris Meagher said.
President Trump has just said in the past week he's going to raise things like Syria, like Ukraine, like the election meddling issue, really the whole range of issues between us. And I think that, in the president's mind, this is very important, because it gives him an opportunity to size up Vladimir Putin, to see where there are areas where we might make progress together and where there are areas where we may not. BRENNAN: Well, right now, Russia is blanket-bombing Southern Syria. That violates the last agreement Vladimir Putin made with President Trump. Why would he believe that he's in any way trustworthy?
Only after this formal commencement of a counterintelligence probe—Crossfire Hurricane—did the FBI begin to target U.S. citizens with spying, wiretapping and other tools usually reserved for foreign infiltrators. Or so the story goes. This account, relayed by the New York Times in December 2017, has proved highly convenient for the FBI. The Australian “government” connection allowed the bureau to infuse the meaningless Papadopoulos conversation with significance, justifying the probe. The origin story suggested the FBI had followed procedure.

Eleven employers in Northern Ireland have been fined for failing to pay the National Living and Minimum Wage to their staff. More than £38,000 was owed to 222 employees in Northern Ireland. Roe Park Resort in Limavady in County Londonderry and Dromore Diocesan Trust in County Armagh were among those on the list. It features 239 UK firms in total, which have to pay £1.44m in back-pay and £1.97m in fines for underpayment. The back pay identified by HMRC was for more workers than in any previous single naming list.
He also praised them "for respecting human rights". The promotion comes just 10 days after the UN human rights body released a report saying that Venezuelan security forces had carried out hundreds of arbitrary killings. According to the report by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, there has been "a pattern of disproportionate and unnecessary use of force by security forces". "The failure to hold security forces accountable for such serious human rights violations suggests that the rule of law is virtually absent in Venezuela," UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said on 22 June. Venezuela's foreign ministry rejected the report, calling it the "result of a highly questionable methodology that buries the credibility and technical rigour demanded of an office of this nature".

Most were in their twenties, and some were couples, but otherwise, they fit no single profile. Only a little information about their fate has trickled out from the secretive North Korean regime. The full explanation of why they were taken remains a mystery. The unexplained state-sponsored crime has shaped Japanese politics, with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe using the abductions to capitalize on anti-North Korean sentiment and advance his political career. Today, Megumi’s image is plastered on posters as the face of the issue, and her story has become a potent source of nationalism, frequently told in government-produced anime films and comic books.

Three organisations - the Sex Worker Advocacy and Resistance Movement (Swarm), the English Collective of Prostitutes (ECP), and the xTalk collective - are planning a demonstration outside Parliament at the time of this Wednesday's debate to protest against the suggested law change. They describe the idea as being a "Trump-inspired" effort to kick sex workers off the internet and put them into "more exploitative and harmful situations". New platforms

Still, there were some bright spots in the data. Those U.S. mall owners with top-tier properties or more heavily trafficked malls have maintained power over their tenants, as rents grew about 0.3 percent in the second quarter against a backdrop of heightened vacancies, Reis said. Real estate investment trusts like Simon, Macerich, GGP, Taubman and Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield have been filling shuttered storefronts with more restaurants, pop-up shops and experiential and service-oriented tenants like gyms and walk-in medical clinics. A cloud hanging over the retail real estate industry has meanwhile prompted a wave of mergers and acquisitions, with many public landlords trading at a heavy discount on the Street. Westfield was recently purchased by European property owner Unibail-Rodamco.

Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, Japan's government spokesman, confirmed the executions to The Associated Press and said authorities were taking precautions in case of any retaliation by his followers. Asahara, 63, whose real name was Chizuo Matsumoto, had been on death row since 2004, when he was convicted of multiple counts of murder after years of court battles.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
AMMAN (Reuters) - Syrian rebel negotiators and Russian officers failed on Wednesday to reach an agreement that would end fighting in southern Syria by restoring state sovereignty over remaining opposition held towns, the rebel spokesman said. “The talks with the Russian enemy in Bosra al-Sham have failed because of their insistence on handing over heavy weapons,” Abu Shaima, a spokesman of the central operations room representing main Free Syrian Army factions negotiating with the Russians told Reuters. Accompanied by a major Russian aerial bombing campaign that has led to some of the fastest mass displacements of the war, Syrian pro-government forces have marched swiftly into insurgent territory in Deraa province over the past two weeks. Another rebel spokesman Ibrahim al Jabawi said negotiations failed to reach any conclusion with the Russian side insisting on handing over heavy weapons in one go rather than in stages as the opposition demanded after the return of tens of thousands of displaced Syrians. Rebels had begun a final round of talks on Wednesday where they had prepared a response to a series of demands by Russian officers that included handing over heavy weapons and restoring state sovereignty over towns in Deraa province still in rebel hands.

Research has consistently shown that Trump won because of racial resentment among white voters. Chris Hayes (@chrislhayes) The modern GOP is basically Steve Bannon, Steve King and Stephen Miller on one side engaged in a project to preserve and enshrine dominance for its ethnic/racial base, and Paul Ryan and John Roberts on the other who pretend they have no idea what they’re up to. While that strategy has worked in the short-term, some Republicans recognize that it can’t work in the long-term, and they’re fighting to save their party from extinction. Can a carbon tax save the GOP? Climate change is one of many issues that divides the Republican Party.
“This tariff is going to hurt the U.S. manufacturers who import from China more than the companies who export from China to the U.S.”

The wonders of the ever-growing artificial intelligence industry are real, and if we have the foresight and strength to channel them in the right direction, the benefits will be enormous. But there is a fundamental danger too: the prospect of machines so closely replicating human thinking and behaviour that they provide a huge boost to the kind of desiccated – and fashionable – materialism that would have you believe that thought, consciousness and even emotion are reducible to machine-like processes. Once that school of thought holds sway, the moral questions surrounding robo-care threaten to disappear – for if a machine that happens to be made of flesh and blood is placed in the care of another machine made of casings and processors, what really is the problem? This, I dare say, may eventually turn into one of the most profound questions of our time. I may well be old and infirm by that point, so I’d like to make a pre-emptive appeal to younger readers: bear the likes of me in mind, and think hard.
Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.
Starting with his own community, Crowley said he aims to "do more" so others will see education as the first "stoplight" before young boys and girls become more incarcerated criminals. "By doing more, I came to the decision of running for state Senate," he said. "We’ve seen it on Tuesday — people really want to see something done in their community." But Crowley’s most challenging hurdle is a stark reality for all Democrats this cycle: falling voter turnout. A new Pew Research study found that while the youngest generations, including Generation X, Millennials, and the post-Millennial generation, make up of the bulk of eligible voters in 2018, if turnout outcomes from the 2014 midterms persist, they are less inclined to comprise of the majority of voters who cast ballots this November.

Nebraska May Join Utah, Idaho in Putting Medicaid Expansion Before Voters

Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.
Liberated in March from immigration detention, where disease and threats were allegedly rife, he had been sent to a city ravaged by decades of civil war and terror. He told me his story but asked for his real name to be withheld as he feared being targeted by the Islamist al-Shabab group because of his work warning young people in the US about the dangers of recruitment by Somali militants.

Six months earlier, in a small town in Minnesota - which is home to the largest population of Somalis living in the US - it was dawn when Ahmed was driving his daughter to nursery.

It seems officers from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) had been watching him closely and, after getting him to pull over, he was shackled and taken into custody.
Practice is only one of Deborah Glass’s 125 recommendations not accepted by Victorian government
Female prisoners in Victoria are still subject to “abusive” routine strip searches, a state government watchdog says. The Victorian ombudsman, Deborah Glass, said the government has failed to adopt a recommendation from her 2015 report into the prison system that called for an end to the searches. “Why has the government not accepted my recommendation to stop the abusive practice of routinely strip-searching women prisoners – in fact, the only recommendation out of 125 not accepted?” she asked on Wednesday. The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year.

Legalize the possession and sale of up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana for personal, recreational use for people over the age of 21. A person could keep up to 10 ounces of marijuana at home. Tax marijuana sales with a 10 percent excise tax at the retail level as well as the state's 6 percent sales tax. Split those revenues, with 35 percent going to K-12 education, 35 percent to roads, 15 percent to the communities that allow marijuana businesses in their communities and 15 percent to counties where marijuana business are located. Allow communities to decide whether they’ll allow marijuana businesses in their towns.

Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.
Its Clair Ridge development is expected to come on-stream later this year. Wood Mackenzie says Clair South, with around 300 million barrels of reserves, could be given the $2.2bn investment green light around 2021. So production would peak around 2027. It looks much less attractive to global players.
That's more than all but three Democratic senators (Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana), all of whom are from red states and facing re-election this fall. "I think he's terrific," Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., who also faces a tough re-election fight, said in an interview. "It's harder work when you're not interested in voting the party line. You've got to look at every issue from all sides." "I really have been pleasantly surprised how willing he is to tell Chuck Schumer to go fly a kite," she added, referring to the Senate minority leader.
I look very much forward to working with him. There is much to be done that will benefit both the United States and Mexico! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 2, 2018
“I think he’s gonna try and help us with border,” Trump told the reporters. He described “unbelievably bad border laws, immigration laws” in the United States, calling them “the weakest in the world, laughed at by everybody in the world.” He contrasted the U.S. immigration laws with “Mexico’s very strong immigration laws.”
Trump suggested that Mexico can help the United States “until we straighten out our immigration laws, which have been bad for many, many years, decades.” He further assured, “We’re gonna have them taken care of.”

The original Penn Station was razed in all its neoclassical glory, and its cramped replacement is a dingy national embarrassment. But 108 years later, the nation’s dense metropolitan areas still depend on railroads to bring millions of suburban commuters to their jobs; Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor line has become profitable and popular; and those twin Hudson tunnels and the swing-span Portal Bridge carry 450 New Jersey Transit and Amtrak trains every day. The problem is, they’re falling apart. The concrete inside the tunnels has been eroding since Superstorm Sandy flooded them with millions of gallons of brackish water in 2012, and the 12,000-volt copper electric cables inside the concrete periodically short-circuit and melt down. “It’s like a volcano erupting,” said Mike Siwiec, an Amtrak electrical specialist who showed me the frayed remains of a cable that ruptured and gridlocked the city in 2015.
Image copyright EPA Image caption Mrs Merkel and Mr Orban embody the EU's split over migration
German leader Angela Merkel has chided Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban over migration, saying they should not forget the issue was about people. At a joint news conference in Berlin, she said if Europe wanted to retain its soul it could not ignore people's needs and suffering. But Mr Orban said the best way to be humane was to close borders and help the countries that migrants came from. EU leaders reached a deal on migration last week. However, differences remain over its implementation.
These numbers are similar to those from a February Quinnipiac poll, where 49 percent of voters said Trump was racist and 46 percent said he was not. Forty-four percent of voters said they think “racist beliefs” were a motive in Trump’s immigration policy, while 50 percent said Trump has “a sincere interest in controlling our borders.” Sixty percent said the policy of separating children from their parents at the border was a violation of human rights. Since enacting the policy, Trump and his associates have repeatedly pushed false, racist narratives to garner support, often associating immigration with high crime rates despite no evidence to support claims that immigrants commit more crime than U.S. citizens. While only 11 percent of Republican voters in the Quinnipiac poll said they think Trump is a racist, 22 percent said they believe Trump has emboldened racist people to express their beliefs publicly. The number of hate crimes rose the year Trump was elected ― the first increase in over a decade.
His precise motive is unclear. This attack is "not a symbol or a representation of our community in Boise, but it's a single evil individual who attacked people with no provocation that we are aware of," Bones said. Kinner is being questioned by authorities. He has been booked into jail on nine counts of aggravated battery and six counts of injury to a child. The police found victims of the attack both within apartments and in the complex's parking lot.

Michael Avenatti told POLITICO that he's being targeted over his political views. | Seth Wenig/AP Photo Feds target Avenatti over old firm's unpaid taxes U.S. Attorney accuses Trump critic of 'misrepresentations' and 'misconduct.' U.S. Government lawyers are slamming one of President Donald Trump's most prominent critics, attorney Michael Avenatti, over nearly half a million dollars in unpaid federal taxes owed by his former firm. Avenatti's former law firm, Eagan Avenatti LLP, agreed to make the roughly $452,000 tax payment last month in order to resolve a bankruptcy case, but the funds never arrived at the IRS, according to a filing Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, Calif.

The submission from tax lawyers in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles attacks Avenatti personally, accusing him of trying to scam the federal government. "The Debtor and its principle [sic] Michael Avenatti made misrepresentations to the United States that it’s [sic] claim would be fully paid," Assistant U.S. Attorney Najah Shariff wrote.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
But she was not a consensus builder.”
Nielsen founded her own consulting firm, called Sunesis Consulting; she brought on a Bush administration colleague, Elizabeth Neumann, as managing partner, and eventually expanded the suburban Washington firm to 15 people. She continued consulting on cybersecurity issues, becoming a senior fellow at The George Washington University’s Center for Cyber & Homeland Security, and working on reports and presentations on that issue and others for the World Economic Forum—the Swiss nonprofit that puts on an annual summit for global economic heavyweights in Davos, Switzerland. ***
While still running her own consulting firm in late 2016, Nielsen volunteered to advise the Trump transition team on homeland security policy. She met John Kelly during that time, and he tapped her to assist him—also as a volunteer—in his confirmation process for DHS secretary.
He aligned himself with most of his Democratic colleagues against Gina Haspel, Trump's pick for CIA director, arguing that her record on enhanced interrogation techniques was unacceptable. And instead of focusing on a politically safe issue in his maiden Senate floor speech, Jones struck a nerve by calling for a dialogue on gun violence after the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida. In addition, during the campaign, Jones made no secret of his desire to protect LGBTQ rights and to support a woman's right to abortion. It's those kinds of positions that have made him a darling of Alabama's progressive minority — and somewhat of a public enemy among the state's conservative majority. Jones has introduced four pieces of legislation — none of any huge significance — since he arrived on Capitol Hill, including two agriculture bills, one that would expand access to capital for rural job creators and the last seeking to mandate an annual Medicaid expansion review.

WASHINGTON – If it's a holiday, it must be time for President Donald Trump to hit the golf course. Right on schedule, the presidential motorcade arrived at the Trump National Golf Club in suburban Virginia in the late morning, the middle of a day that also has the president tweeting and hosting a military-themed picnic later at the White House. As he departed the presidential mansion in the morning, Trump took to Twitter. In addition to a general salutation – "Happy Fourth of July....Our Country is doing GREAT!"
Last month, the government said private employers added 218,000 jobs, which was higher than ADP's revised figure of 189,000.
“Communities identify their own solutions. This brings people together and they think beyond normal services. They want programmes to end violence, community-wide empowerment charters for women and girls, drug prevention clinics and basic schooling for all generations. When people are given options, they take them.”
The next layer, the development and generation of capacities, includes community education programmes, such as IT training, English and parenting. “Education becomes a part of everyday life for many,” says Barrantes.
The report also said that Strzok repeatedly pushed for more aggressive action in the Clinton probe. "The conduct by these employees cast a cloud over the entire FBI investigation and sowed doubt about the FBI’s work," the report concluded. "The damage caused by these employees’ actions extends far beyond the scope of the (Clinton) investigation and goes to the heart of the FBI’s reputation for neutral fact finding and political independence." Goelman, in an op-ed in USA TODAY last month, said Strzok has become the victim of "political gamesmanship" by Congress and President Trump, who has repeatedly tweeted about Strzok as evidence of bias by the FBI and Justice Department. "They have spent months cynically taking these texts out of context and saying that one- or two-word snippets somehow prove that the FBI investigations of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the Russia probe itself, were biased," Goelman wrote.
And look; God knows human beings can do horrible things. But in this respect, triggering climate change was not our fault, right? We've been using energy since - for 10,000 years in any form we could find - animal dung, animals themselves - to power civilization. And when we discovered oil, it's not like we, you know, twirled our mustaches and said, mwahahaha (ph), I will destroy the planet. Instead we used it to do amazing things - heating homes, you know, making internal combustion engines.
Teddy Roosevelt hopped on whistle stop tour after whistle stop tour where he was able to drop into rural and suburban communities alike to deliver short, pre-packaged speeches that local papers would usually print verbatim. (He left them short on purpose for that very reason.) Franklin Roosevelt revolutionized and heightened the stature of the office with his fireside chats, that brought his message over the heads of the pesky press corps and directly into the living rooms of the American people. But, though it would have been seen as a scoop, even the reporters covering Lyndon B. Johnson had the good sense not to report on every turd he dropped in their presence. While the founders envisioned a government that moved slowly and methodically, today’s Wi-Fi-enabled political discourse is demanding the opposite.
As motorists pay more to fill their tanks this Independence Day -- with gas prices at a four-year high for the holiday -- safety advocates are urging caution during celebrations that turn deadly on U.S. roadways. The national average for a gallon of gas on Tuesday stood at $2.86, making it the costliest for an Independence Day holiday in four years, according to AAA. That said, the nearly 40 million motorists expected to travel this week will pay 11 cents less per gallon at the pump than they did this past Memorial Day holiday, the motorist club noted. "The national gas price average has held fairly steady for the past 10 days, suggesting that U.S. demand is keeping pace with supply and stabilizing summer gas prices," a spokesperson for the motorist group said in a statement. "However, elevated crude oil prices and other geopolitical concerns could tilt gas prices more expensive in the early fall despite an expected increase in global crude production from OPEC and its partners."
President Donald Trump mocked journalists for questioning his readiness for his upcoming summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin during a campaign rally in Montana, where he tried to boost the candidacy of Democratic Sen. Jon Tester's Republican challenger, state Auditor Matt Rosendale. Trump vowed that he'll be prepared for the July 16 summit in Finland, saying "I've been preparing for this stuff my whole life." He adds that journalists questioning his readiness "don't say that." Trump motioned to news media covering the Great Falls rally and said 75 percent "of those people are downright dishonest." His barbs against the media came on a day when newsrooms across the U.S. held a moment of silence in remembrance of five Maryland newspaper staffers who were fatally shot last week by a man who authorities say held a grudge against the publication.

In rulings on issues such as workplace arbitration, sexual harassment, voting rights, consumer rights and civil rights, the court could have a particuilar impact on society’s most vulnerable. “I think the reality is that the court’s influence on everyday lives is felt most directly by those who tend to depend upon government, those who may not be in a socio-economic position to adequately vindicate their own rights without some government assistance,” said Vladeck. ‘Elections have consequences’
The opportunity for Republicans, who account for only 27% of voters, to lock in a conservative supreme court for a generation represents a tremendous payoff in a series of gambles for a party that has appeared in danger of breaking apart. In one of his most audacious power plays, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, refused to consider Merrick Garland, Obama’s final supreme court pick, for eight months in 2016, arguing that the choice had to wait for the election.

Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
This is just terrible timing all around." Medicaid, an $11 billion, state-federal health plan in Kentucky, covers 1.4 million people, about 600,000 of them children. The federal government provides about 80 percent of the state's Medicaid funds. The cuts to dental and vision benefits were supposed to affect only able-bodied adults, mostly those added to Medicaid under an expansion authorized through the Affordable Care Act.

Breitbart News reported in April 2017 that the major Missouri institution would close a total of seven residential buildings. “Historically every year between now and August, various situations occur that result in position openings, e.g. normal attrition and voluntary staff choices, as well as unplanned academic or personal challenges,” the university said in a statement. “If necessary, we will offer alternative employment opportunities at comparable compensation to the remaining staff.”
Several years later, the university is still facing a crisis. According to new reports, the University of Missouri is currently facing a $49 million budget shortfall. Additionally, the university has laid off 30 employees and eliminated 155 vacant positions.

In one case, Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion that illegal immigrants do not have the same bargaining rights as American citizens and legal workers. “… an illegal immigrant worker is not an ’employee’ under the NLRA for the simple reason that, ever since 1986, an illegal immigrant worker is not a lawful ’employee’ in the United States,” Kavanaugh wrote. In another case, Kavanaugh noted that American multi-national corporations do not have the right to import foreign workers. The Circuit judge explained, “Under the provision of the immigration laws at issue here, mere economic expediency does not authorize an employer to displace American workers for foreign workers.”
Prominent conservative Ann Coulter has also called for Trump to nominate Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, arguing that other judges such as Thomas Hardiman and Raymond Kethledge “are open borders zealots.”

Nearly 600 more retail jobs are to go in the UK as the Jacques Vert, Windsmoor and Precis department store brands are wound down by administrators. Administrators said they had failed to find a buyer for Calvetron Brands, which had been restructured following a rescue deal last summer. The business entered administration in May and had already shed more than 400 jobs before Wednesday’s announcement. The latest retail job losses come as more than 30,000 jobs are at risk in the UK following mass closure announcements by major chains including House of Fraser, New Look and Marks & Spencer. Retailers are suffering from rising costs and the switch to online shopping just as hard-pressed consumers rein in spending.

The list of Democrats expressing frustration with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has been growing longer in recent weeks, but don’t expect to see former President Barack Obama’s name on it. At a party fundraising event Friday afternoon in Northern California, Obama spoke highly of Pelosi – and even predicted that she will return to the job of House speaker after November’s midterm elections. “I think everybody knows how much I love Nancy Pelosi,” Obama told the gathering at a home in affluent Atherton, Politico reported. "Nancy, I believe, is one of the greatest speakers we ever had, and will once again be one of the greatest speakers we ever have after we get through this cycle," he continued. “And there's not much I could have gotten done without having Nancy there alongside of me every step of the way.”

Elections frenzy continues in emerging markets and after Turkey last week, it’s Mexico’s turn on Sunday. Polls predict that former Mexico City mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will be the next president, possibly garnering over half of the votes. This is the third bid for the key job by AMLO as the leftist Lopez Obrador is commonly known; his popularity has grown hand in hand with Mexicans’ anger at the failure of traditional parties to end record levels of violence and corruption. His history of protest politics has unnerved investors though and while throughout this campaign AMLO has courted Wall Street, he has still pledged to review a 2013 opening of the oil industry to private producers. The vote comes at a delicate point for Mexico, which is at odds with the United States over migration and trade, while talks on reworking the NAFTA trade agreement are deadlocked.
Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.
Michigan lawmakers axed a requirement that would make prospective teachers take a basic skills test before earning their certification in Michigan. Rick Snyder signed legislation last week to get rid of the law requiring all prospective teachers to take the SAT to become certified in the state of Michigan, the Detroit Free Press reported. “The basic skills test … is not a strong indicator of how successful a teacher will be,” said Sen. Marty Knollenberg (R-Troy), one of the sponsors of the bipartisan-supported legislation. Knollenberg, who serves as the state Senate Education Committee chair, said the panel made its decision to make it easier for people to become teachers.

On Wednesday, Mr McVey said the council had "engaged pretty consistently" with the government, adding: "Fiona Hyslop said any scheme would require engagement with the industry and that's exactly what we're doing. "We have taken a far more robust and professional approach and I've noticed a huge amount of openness to the idea in some quarters that were fairly dismissive of our previous attempts as a local authority." The Scottish Conservatives - who oppose having a tourist tax scheme - said the exchange was "an embarrassing split right at the top of the SNP", with Ms Hyslop "slapping down" Mr McVey "in full public view".
A new USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll about patriotism, pegged to this week's celebration of the Fourth of July, finds an overwhelming majority of those surveyed — 90 percent — say they are proud to be Americans. But they split almost down the middle, 42 percent to 39 percent, when asked whether they are proud of America right now. Not surprisingly, the split was along partisan lines: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. There was bipartisan agreement on one thing: Across party lines, roughly seven in 10 agree with the statement, "I feel fatigued watching the news." Elsewhere in politics

He cut off reporters' questions when they asked how he felt when he heard his daughter's name read in court. Prosecutor Autrey James said the two men were convicted "because they acted negligently running that building known as the Ghost Ship." James declined to answer questions outside court, saying the case was still active until the men are formally sentenced in August. Almena's attorney Tony Serra said his client agreed to the plea bargain to alleviate "the pain and suffering of all parties." Serra previously said a plea deal would spare the victims' families from testifying at a trial where photos of burned bodies and other emotionally fraught evidence would be shown.
Medical director says staff intervened during 12 overdoses which otherwise would ‘likely have been fatal’
Victorian government rejects criticism of drug-injecting room saying it is saving lives
The Victorian government has hit back at claims Melbourne’s medically supervised drug-injecting room is a failure, with the centre’s director saying staff intervened during 12 overdoses since it opened less than a week ago. On Friday the shadow attorney general, John Pesutto, criticised the injecting room saying it had not prevented drug use continuing around the centre. Pesutto called for an “independent” analysis, saying he would not take the centre’s staff or the government’s data at “face value”. There were also claims published in the Herald Sun that drug users in the North Richmond area, notorious for heroin use and dealing, were snubbing the centre. However, Dr Nico Clark said on Friday that there had been between one and three overdoses a day that had required staff to provide oxygen or administer the heroin antidote naloxone.

According to a Russian state media report related by Turkey’s Hurriyet Daily News , the United States is planning to send next-generation B61 nuclear gravity bombs to NATO bases in several European countries, including Turkey. The bomb is said to be compatible with F-35 joint strike fighters, which Turkey is also due to receive amid some controversy. Hurriyet describes the B61 nuclear bomb and Russia’s sour reaction to the prospect of NATO bases receiving them:
The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) and the U.S. Air Force completed two non-nuclear system qualification flight tests of the B61-12 gravity bomb on June 9 at Tonopah Test Range in Nevada, according to a June 29 statement by DOE/NNSA. The test, which was reportedly the first of its kind, was aimed at extending the B61 bomb’s service life by adapting it to next generation aircraft, including B-2A Spirit Bomber. “The B61-12 LEP will consolidate and replace the existing B61 bomb variants in the [U.S.] nuclear stockpile.
A new USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll about patriotism, pegged to this week's celebration of the Fourth of July, finds an overwhelming majority of those surveyed — 90 percent — say they are proud to be Americans. But they split almost down the middle, 42 percent to 39 percent, when asked whether they are proud of America right now. Not surprisingly, the split was along partisan lines: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. There was bipartisan agreement on one thing: Across party lines, roughly seven in 10 agree with the statement, "I feel fatigued watching the news." Elsewhere in politics

'We’re going to run different'
His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.

Ethiopia's government has fired five prison officials as it confronts allegations of torture and other abuses of inmates as part of a wave of reforms. Among those fired is the federal prison chief who until recently defended the treatment of inmates as "fair." The firings came ahead of a new Human Rights Watch report released Thursday that documents widespread arbitrary detention, torture, rape and humiliation over several years in Ethiopia's eastern Somali region. It urges new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to investigate the "horrific" situation. Abiy has admitted that security forces have tortured people but has yet to "tackle Ethiopia's culture of impunity and ensure accountability," said Felix Horne, senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Practice is only one of Deborah Glass’s 125 recommendations not accepted by Victorian government
Female prisoners in Victoria are still subject to “abusive” routine strip searches, a state government watchdog says. The Victorian ombudsman, Deborah Glass, said the government has failed to adopt a recommendation from her 2015 report into the prison system that called for an end to the searches. “Why has the government not accepted my recommendation to stop the abusive practice of routinely strip-searching women prisoners – in fact, the only recommendation out of 125 not accepted?” she asked on Wednesday. The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year.
The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. Teachers are also running a ballot measure campaign that would tax the highest income earners for an additional $690 million to spend on schools. “Regardless of political parties, we need people to make a decision about what’s happening in the classroom,” said Marisol Garcia, vice president of the Arizona Education Association. “To limit ourselves and to say ‘only these people are going to support us’ is just not true.”
Teachers can be at a disadvantage compared to wealthier candidates, who tend to have built-in networks of potential donors.
Thirty-two states with renewable standards didn't have, on average, a correlated rate increase, according to Wesley Hersche, an associate director of research with Arizona State University's Global Security Initiative. "These issues involve a complex interaction of factors, and we should be careful not to oversimplify things," Hersche wrote in April. "But renewable energy technologies such as solar, wind, and battery storage have become so cheap recently that this finding is not all that surprising."
"This was amazing because you had a whole Chicago community trying to find her and people on social media trying to find her," Lowe said. "When we jumped in the car, we didn't know what was going to happen," he said. "The fact we were able to bring her home and she's with her mom — I can't even. Bruno permitted reporters to use her daughter's name and photo, saying the case was already highly publicized.
You've got to look at every issue from all sides." "I really have been pleasantly surprised how willing he is to tell Chuck Schumer to go fly a kite," she added, referring to the Senate minority leader. At other times, however, Jones has taken up liberal positions seen as risky for a Democratic senator from a GOP state. He aligned himself with most of his Democratic colleagues against Gina Haspel, Trump's pick for CIA director, arguing that her record on enhanced interrogation techniques was unacceptable. And instead of focusing on a politically safe issue in his maiden Senate floor speech, Jones struck a nerve by calling for a dialogue on gun violence after the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida.

There was, however, one saving grace: In Colorado, there was solid food, not just instant soup for the detainees. And there were beds, too. As the days passed, Rosa had no way of knowing how long she'd be locked away or when or whether she would ever be reunited with her son. Faith helped her through it.
“That was a very sad day for the country when that vote was cast,” Trump said in June. But Republican lawmakers dispute arguments suggesting their efforts to undo ObamaCare have been totally fruitless. “We eliminated the individual mandate that said that people had to buy government-approved insurance,” said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo. “In a sense, it blew a big hole in ObamaCare.”
There’s a potential electoral landmine ahead for Republicans hoping to keep their majorities in the House and Senate, though: premium increases. “We’re going to get another round right before the election, which is something the GOP is nervous about,” said John C. Goodman, president of the Goodman Institute.

Eleven employers in Northern Ireland have been fined for failing to pay the National Living and Minimum Wage to their staff. More than £38,000 was owed to 222 employees in Northern Ireland. Roe Park Resort in Limavady in County Londonderry and Dromore Diocesan Trust in County Armagh were among those on the list. It features 239 UK firms in total, which have to pay £1.44m in back-pay and £1.97m in fines for underpayment. The back pay identified by HMRC was for more workers than in any previous single naming list.
The University of Missouri is still facing enrollment and budgetary problems, including a $49 million budget shortfall, as a result of the 2015 social justice protests that caught national media attention. Many people remember the high-pitched yell of former University of Missouri professor Melissa Click. Click found herself at the center of weeks of unrest at the University of Missouri in 2015 and 2016. Click rose to infamy after a video of her calling for a student photojournalist to be physically removed from campus simply because he was documenting the protests. The protests involved accusations by students that the administration had mishandled several alleged racial issues on campus.

On the Fourth of July, 1852, America celebrated its freedom, as it does every Independence Day. Frederick Douglass, America’s most famous anti-slavery activist and fugitive slave, saw no ground to celebrate: he saw the octopus arms of slavery stretched everywhere, exposing the hollowness of America’s freedom values. That holiday, he delivered the greatest antislavery speech in American history. Not least since the racism that made slavery endures.
That may be less true in cases where U.S. companies engage in businesses with a ready substitute. Chinese leader Xi Jinping recently hinted that European and Asian conglomerates might soon find themselves benefiting as China punches back against the U.S.

In turn, that means American firms in China could soon find their new product models at the bottom of the regulatory pile for things like safety approvals, or their state-owned Chinese partners might shift resources toward European joint ventures instead. China has a history of this sort of bureaucratic malfeasance, with its consumers often helping out.
She said she believed it would be inappropriate to ask a nominee how they would vote on a future case. But she emphasized that they had to talk about precedent. In her view, Roe v. Wade is settled law, and she wanted someone on the court who would respect precedent. "What I want to see is a nominee who, regardless of his or her personal views on the very difficult and contentious life issue, is going to respect precedent, regardless," she said. "A number of judges (have told me) that good judges are always unhappy with some of their decisions but they make the right call regardless of their personal views.
'THIS IS YOUR RECEIPT': Jarrod W. Ramos, the man suspected of killing five people during an attack on the Capital Gazette newspaper last week in Annapolis, Maryland, sent multiple threatening letters prior to the shooting, police revealed on Monday ... The paper’s former attorney gave police mail he received at his law office on Monday, the newspaper's former publisher Thomas Marquardt told The Baltimore Sun. One of those documents, dated June 28 – the same day as the shooting – allegedly included a letter from Ramos in which he said he was en route to the paper “with the objective of killing every person present.”
The letter was written in the form of a “Motion for Reconsideration” by a Maryland court following a 2016 refusal to hear Ramos’ defamation case that he had filed against the outlet. That stemmed from a 2011 column published in the paper about a criminal harassment charge against Ramos that was filed by a former high school classmate. “You were too cowardly to confront those lies, and this is your receipt,” he allegedly wrote.
Nuclear wouldn't count toward the 50 percent mandate, and APS says its Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station is the largest electricity producer in the U.S.
Jeff Burke, APS director of resources planning, says customers would see 6 to 14 percent per year increases on their bills if the company is forced to ratchet up renewable use ahead of schedule. "We continue to add renewables to our system, but they have to make sense," Burke said. "It's not really about a target, it's about what makes sense for our customers' usage and what makes rates affordable and what keeps our system reliable." Thirty-two states with renewable standards didn't have, on average, a correlated rate increase, according to Wesley Hersche, an associate director of research with Arizona State University's Global Security Initiative. "These issues involve a complex interaction of factors, and we should be careful not to oversimplify things," Hersche wrote in April.
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Turns 50
The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was presented for signatures 50 years ago today. NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Lawrence Weiler, one of the U.S. negotiators of the treaty. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
It's been weeks since President Trump declared talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a great success. But today, the Washington Post is reporting that U.S. intelligence officials have concluded North Korea does not intend to fully surrender its nuclear stockpile. We thought this would be a good moment to check in with someone who spent decades working on arms reduction and denuclearization treaties.
Hamilton, the Republican state lawmaker who beat the incumbent Karnes, won with a mix of support from teachers and other unions. While Karnes sparred with teachers during the strike, Hamilton took a moderate position. He aligned with teachers unions by opposing state right-to-work legislation and the proposed repeal of prevailing wage laws for public construction projects. The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.
Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.
"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.
Pentagon Questioned Over Blackout On War Zone Troop Numbers

For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.

The latest high-level departure from President Donald Trump's Cabinet was not the most unexpected departure that has faced the administration. Scott Pruitt, the administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency, came under fire multiple times during his tenure over questionable finances, including both excessive spending and sweetheart deals that helped him spend less than expected. Here's a review of his time in office. Dec. 7, 2016: Trump announces that Pruitt will be his nominee for EPA administrator
The then-Attorney General of Oklahoma was touted by Trump as having "great qualifications and a good record." Part of that record was Pruitt touting himself as a "leading advocate against the EPA's activist agenda," and his history of challenging the EPA was well known.
Daniel Egan tells inquiry that it was obvious everybody needed to get out, not stay put
The inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire has heard that a senior firefighter who arrived at the blaze just before 2am thought the residents should have been evacuated long before they were. During testimonies that made clear a lack of communication between firefighters, the inquiry heard how Daniel Egan, a senior fire safety officer with the London fire brigade arrived at the fire at 1.58am and immediately thought “we need to get people out of the building.”
“It looked like a film, people were shouting and screaming, they were panicking and wanting people to help,” he said. “My first thoughts were that we needed to get everybody out. I could hear the roar of the tower. It was obvious … you could hear people screaming … it was just so obvious, sorry.”
The “stay put” policy wasn’t abandoned until 2.47am, after which residents calling 999 who had been told to stay in their flats were told to try and evacuate.

But Ice says it takes all allegations of abuse very seriously, and has a zero-tolerance policy towards any such actions. "Through an aggressive inspections programme, Ice ensures its facilities meet the required detention standards," Ice spokesman Brendan Raedy in response to the allegations about abuse and conditions in detention centres. "Ice provides several levels of oversight in order to ensure that detainees in Ice custody reside in safe, secure and humane environments," he added, saying detainees could file grievances that would be independently reviewed. Last December, Ice dismissed a report published by a US human rights group detailing allegations of physical, sexual and verbal abuse after a failed deportation flight to Somalia via Senegal as "categorically false".

The strategy reprises last year's successful approach to confirming Justice Neil Gorsuch in the early spring of 2017. Gorsuch was named to fill the vacancy left by the death of Antonin Scalia and then kept open by the refusal of the Senate's Republican majority to consider Merrick Garland, the replacement named by President Barack Obama in 2016. Gorsuch was greeted with delight by abortion opponents, even though he had not ruled directly on Roe in his judicial career. But his confirmation was far from a sure thing because two Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, were seen as defenders of abortion rights.

Shoko Asahara, the founder of the Japanese doomsday cult Aum Shinrikyo, which killed 13 people and injured hundreds more with sarin gas in Tokyo in 1995, was hanged on Friday along with six of his followers, the government said. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, Japan's government spokesman, confirmed the executions to The Associated Press and said authorities were taking precautions in case of any retaliation by his followers. Asahara, 63, whose real name was Chizuo Matsumoto, had been on death row since 2004, when he was convicted of multiple counts of murder after years of court battles.
Peach Wars: Southern States Spar Over Which Has The Most Juice
It's a juicy rivalry complete with peach emoji and a well-timed "bless your heart." The agriculture departments in Georgia and South Carolina sparred on Twitter this week over which of them really deserves the title of Peach State. It started with a tweet from South Carolina's Department of Agriculture — an account off to a feisty start since it was created in June. The department claimed that South Carolina harvests three times more peaches than Georgia does. We know Georgia gets all the credit but SC actually harvests three times more peaches than GA 🍑 pic.twitter.com/W8OXoj5Sh1 — South Carolina Department of Agriculture (@SCDAgriculture) July 3, 2018

Even Pruitt’s own staff had begun to sour on him, with many worrying that their future career prospects would be damaged by their association with Pruitt’s tenure. Each scandal seemed more damning than the last. Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.

There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void. In New Jersey, this is compounded by the fact that the state is located between two big cities, New York and Philadelphia, that are in other states. The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
On this much police and activist South Side priest Michael Pfleger can agree: Saturday morning’s anti-violence march on the Dan Ryan Expressway is all about danger. Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.
— MINING: The EPA said last year that it won't require mining companies to prove they have the financial resources to clean up pollution, an Obama-era rule stemming from a long history of pollution spilling from abandoned mines into streams. Pruitt said modern mining practices and existing regulations made the financial requirement unnecessary and a burden on mining. — AUTOS: Pruitt's EPA has proposed freezing vehicle fuel-efficiency standards at 2020 levels for the next five years, according to a draft of the proposal obtained by Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del. For new vehicles, that means an average of about 30 miles per gallon instead of rising to 36 mpg by 2025 as Obama's EPA proposed. — OIL AND GAS: More than a dozen states are suing the EPA for failing to take action against leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, from oil and natural gas wells.

LONDON — Over the past century American and British troops have fought side-by-side in two World Wars, Korea and the conflicts in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan. But some lawmakers and experts in the United Kingdom are warning that the British military could soon be seen as irrelevant by the United States unless it receives a colossal funding boost. "There is a concern that the U.K. is falling ever further behind and becoming even more useless from a U.S. point of view," said Andrew Dorman, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a think tank in London.

One of those documents, dated June 28 – the same day as the shooting – allegedly included a letter from Ramos in which he said he was en route to the paper “with the objective of killing every person present.”
The letter was written in the form of a “Motion for Reconsideration” by a Maryland court following a 2016 refusal to hear Ramos’ defamation case that he had filed against the outlet. That stemmed from a 2011 column published in the paper about a criminal harassment charge against Ramos that was filed by a former high school classmate. “You were too cowardly to confront those lies, and this is your receipt,” he allegedly wrote.
A judge ordered federal emergency officials to extend vouchers for temporary hotel housing for nearly 1,700 Puerto Rican hurricane evacuees, saying ending the program could cause irreparable harm. Saturday night's decision came shortly after civil rights group LatinoJustice PRLDEF filed a lawsuit seeking relief for the Puerto Ricans, whose federal housing assistance vouchers were set to expire at midnight Sunday, meaning the evacuees could have been evicted from the hotels. The order says the agency cannot end its Transitional Sheltering Assistance program until at least midnight on Tuesday. The organization is pushing to let families stay another six months. U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin of Massachusetts wrote that ending the program would drain other public resources.
Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) spent a total of $4 billion on improper food stamp payments to those receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the USDA confirmed with Breitbart News on Friday. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service announced this week that improper payments made up 6.3 percent of SNAP money in the fiscal year (FY) 2017—the latest data available from the agency. Breitbart News analyzed the USDA’s data on food stamp spending and found that $4,007,026,532 of the $63,603,595,754 the agency spent on SNAP in FY 2017 went to improper payments. The USDA told Breitbart News that “it is important to note that improper payments include both overpayments and underpayments,” meaning that households on SNAP that received less than what they were supposed to receive for the month are also included in the percentage rate. Brandon Lipps, the Acting Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services at the agency, said that most improper payments are due to “human errors”—either because of state agencies miscalculating benefits or benefit recipients giving state agencies the wrong information.The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) spent a total of $4 billion on improper food stamp payments to those receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the USDA confirmed with Breitbart News on Friday.
Mr. Low previously offered to provide information about Mr. Najib and 1MDB in return for immunity from criminal prosecution, but Mr. Mahathir turned him down, according to people familiar with the proposed deal. Malaysian authorities have issued a warrant for Mr. Low’s arrest, Mr. Mahathir said last month. Mr. Low couldn’t be reached for comment. He previously has denied any wrongdoing, and his lawyers have said he has instructed them to cooperate with investigators. He is believed to be in China.
S&P 500 e-minis were down 4.5 points, or 0.16 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 15.5 points, or 0.22 percent. Meanwhile, investors awaited the U.S. jobs data for June, when employers likely maintained a brisk pace of hiring while increasing wages for workers. The Labor Department report, due at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to show nonfarm payrolls increased by 195,000 jobs last month, while average hourly earnings are expected to rise 0.3 percent. Just before the tariff deadline, President Donald Trump upped the ante, warning that the United States may ultimately target over $500 billion worth of Chinese goods, or roughly the total amount of U.S. imports from China last year.
And so she retreated to her shelter, where she tried to flatten her growing belly by wrapping it in tight layers of scarves.

Because of that, no one knows how many rape survivors have given birth.
It is Trump’s responsibility, however, to help the nation heal in the aftermath. So it’s important that he reversed course Tuesday and called for the lowering of American flags in honor of the five victims. Trump initially rebuffed Annapolis Mayor Gavin Buckley’s request over the weekend to lower flags to half-staff. READ MORE: In a time of hate, your civility lectures aren't helping anyone »
“Obviously, I’m disappointed, you know?” Buckley told the Capital Gazette on Monday.
Despite decades of UN and government aid, 38% of the population lived in extreme poverty. Social workers proposed new a new approach. Puente al Desarrollo – A Bridge to Development – is human rights-based legislation that has seen government agencies and communities coming together to address social problems – and support people in meeting their aspirations. The new law applies a social work approach of responding to all the issues that contribute to poverty and strengthening community systems of self-care. Cristian Rodríguez Barrantes, a social worker on a drug-smuggling route in the Costa Rican slums, describes how the law works in practice.
POLITICO Playbook: Michael Cohen speaks
NEW YORK, NY - MAY 30: Michael Cohen, (C) former personal lawyer and confidante for President Donald Trump, exits the United States District Court Southern District of New York on May 30, 2018 in New York City. According to a filing submitted to the court Tuesday night by special master Barbara Jones, federal prosecutors investigating Michael Cohen, a longtime personal lawyer and confidante for President Donald Trump, are set to receive 1 million files from three of his cellphones that were seized last month.

BREAKING ... ABC NEWS' GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS SPOKE TO MICHAEL COHEN: "Michael Cohen says family and country, not President Trump, is his 'first loyalty'": "When I asked Cohen directly what he would do if prosecutors forced him to choose between protecting the president and protecting his family, he said his family is 'my first priority.' "Cohen added: 'Once I understand what charges might be filed against me, if any at all, I will defer to my new counsel, Guy Petrillo, for guidance.' Story Continued Below
"But when I pointed out to Cohen that he wasn’t repeating past vows to 'take a bullet' and 'do anything' to protect the president, the longtime Trump loyalist left little doubt about where he stands now, saying simply: 'To be crystal clear, my wife, my daughter and my son, and this country have my first loyalty.'

Ivanka Trump visited the Supreme Court at Justice Kennedy's invitation after the two of them met after the inauguration.

(Reuters) - A man went on a stabbing spree at a 3-year-old’s birthday party at an apartment complex housing refugee families in Boise on Saturday, injuring nine people, including six children, police said on Sunday. Timmy Kinner, a 30-year-old from Los Angeles who had been staying at the complex, has been arrested, Boise police said. He is not an immigrant and went on the rampage a day after being asked to leave by one of the residents, police said. Kinner was being held without bail at the Ada County jail on 15 charges, including six of injury to a child and nine of aggravated battery, jail records showed. There was no lawyer listed for Kinner in the records.

But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said. Tackett said he's concerned about children, especially in Eastern Kentucky, which has a higher rate of Medicaid patients and some of the state's worst oral health. "I have no problem with them regulating the adults that are on Medicaid," Tackett said. "If they are young and healthy, they should be out working or doing something.

Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report says Democrats are "likely" to carry Montana in the Senate race. Inside Elections rates the contest as one that "tilts Democratic." After the rally, the spokesman for Tester's re-election campaign put out a statement that was critical of Rosendale but which did not mention the president. "Jon's record is clear—if it's good for Montana, Jon works with anyone from either party to get things done. If it's bad for Montana, he'll stand up to anyone," Tester spokesman Chris Meagher said.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.
Germany remains haunted by the Nazis' mass murder of Jews in 1933-1945. Ms Giffey, a centre-left Social Democrat (SPD) politician, said teachers needed more support to combat anti-Semitism, as the problem went beyond the classroom, involving parents and society at large. "So in the coming school year, as a first step, we will send 170 anti-bullying experts into selected schools in Germany, funded by the federal authorities," she told the daily Rheinische Post.

The strategy reprises last year's successful approach to confirming Justice Neil Gorsuch in the early spring of 2017. Gorsuch was named to fill the vacancy left by the death of Antonin Scalia and then kept open by the refusal of the Senate's Republican majority to consider Merrick Garland, the replacement named by President Barack Obama in 2016. Gorsuch was greeted with delight by abortion opponents, even though he had not ruled directly on Roe in his judicial career. But his confirmation was far from a sure thing because two Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, were seen as defenders of abortion rights.

Lyft, like Uber, is moving beyond cars. The ride-hailing startup on Monday announced it will acquire Motivate, the largest bikeshare operator in North America. Motivate operates Citi Bike in New York and Capital Bikeshare in Washington DC, among other brands. The move comes as Lyft has been expanding its reach in the transportation space. It has integrated public transit in its app and introduced Lyft Line, which lets users share a ride with strangers who are going to destinations close together.
North Korea is believed to be constructing an operational nuclear-armed ballistic missile submarine, and U.S. intelligence officials believe the rogue regime is deliberately “deceiving” Washington -- even as Pyongyang says it seeks peace and denuclearization. South Korea believes the North is working on the submarine on its east coast, Kim Hack-yong, a South Korean lawmaker who was at the helm of the legislature’s defense committee until his term ended a few weeks ago, told The Wall Street Journal on Friday. Kim cited intelligence reports he's viewed to support the claim. Satellite images revealed workers and materials moving at the port of Sinpo, Kim said. The construction is reportedly being done at an indoor facility.
You've had Senators Joe Donnelly, Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp, who are the three red state Democrats who voted in favor of Neil Gorsuch, get their only personal meeting with President Trump and who say they are very open to confirming President Trump nominee who -- if the nominee is the right person. So those are the five senators who our attention is going to be really on for the next two months. BRENNAN: And what about immigration, Jan? Do you think this could actually come before the Supreme Court (INAUDIBLE)?

"I think he's terrific," Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., who also faces a tough re-election fight, said in an interview. "It's harder work when you're not interested in voting the party line. You've got to look at every issue from all sides." "I really have been pleasantly surprised how willing he is to tell Chuck Schumer to go fly a kite," she added, referring to the Senate minority leader.
Elections frenzy continues in emerging markets and after Turkey last week, it’s Mexico’s turn on Sunday. Polls predict that former Mexico City mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will be the next president, possibly garnering over half of the votes. This is the third bid for the key job by AMLO as the leftist Lopez Obrador is commonly known; his popularity has grown hand in hand with Mexicans’ anger at the failure of traditional parties to end record levels of violence and corruption. His history of protest politics has unnerved investors though and while throughout this campaign AMLO has courted Wall Street, he has still pledged to review a 2013 opening of the oil industry to private producers. The vote comes at a delicate point for Mexico, which is at odds with the United States over migration and trade, while talks on reworking the NAFTA trade agreement are deadlocked.
"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.
Nebraska May Join Utah, Idaho in Putting Medicaid Expansion Before Voters

Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.

Many Americans gaze at the sky and see only a vast uncharted frontier for exploration. But President Donald Trump reminds Americans that there’s another potential reality in space: It could become a military battlefield, a place where this nation’s independence is protected or lost. The point isn’t to repel an alien invasion from deep space. We’re not worried about Klingons. But Americans do have reason to be concerned about technologically advancing adversaries here on Earth.
Goelman, in an op-ed in USA TODAY last month, said Strzok has become the victim of "political gamesmanship" by Congress and President Trump, who has repeatedly tweeted about Strzok as evidence of bias by the FBI and Justice Department. "They have spent months cynically taking these texts out of context and saying that one- or two-word snippets somehow prove that the FBI investigations of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the Russia probe itself, were biased," Goelman wrote. "Despite the obvious partisan gamesmanship going on, the reality is that Pete did nothing more than express his personal opinions in private conversations with a friend and colleague," the attorney said. "And what his attackers fail to ever mention is that, among the many other texts, Pete criticizes a range of both Democratic and Republican figures, including Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and (former Attorney General) Loretta Lynch."

LONDON — Over the past century American and British troops have fought side-by-side in two World Wars, Korea and the conflicts in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan. But some lawmakers and experts in the United Kingdom are warning that the British military could soon be seen as irrelevant by the United States unless it receives a colossal funding boost. "There is a concern that the U.K. is falling ever further behind and becoming even more useless from a U.S. point of view," said Andrew Dorman, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a think tank in London.
It's what economists call a free-rider problem. The economically rational decision today for someone who used to be a member of a public union is to say, hey, if I can get this for free, why should I pay for it? And that, of course, will deal a blow to the effectiveness of unions both in bargaining and in other activities. And it will diminish their power, which is a long-sought goal of conservatives.

Corporate America couldn’t hire Republican lobbyists fast enough after President Donald Trump’s election gave the GOP unified control of Washington. Now there are signs that Democrats are back in demand. Companies and trade groups are trying to hire congressional staffers with ties to influential House Democrats four months ahead of the midterm elections, in which Democrats are expected to pick up seats and potentially retake control of the House. Lobbyists are helping their clients meet with the Democrats who would become committee chairs if the party does win back the chamber. And trade groups are talking to members about what to expect from a Democratic takeover.

The current tax splash is its last throw of the dice, a direct pitch for people who have lost faith in government to take the money instead. It sends the subtle message that the economy is travelling well and there’s money to spare. But it’s the inability of a decentralised wages system to share the growth, and the overreach in destroying Australia’s progressive tax system, that remains the ultimate hand-brake for these cuts to be the path to redemption for the government.

"I really have been pleasantly surprised how willing he is to tell Chuck Schumer to go fly a kite," she added, referring to the Senate minority leader. At other times, however, Jones has taken up liberal positions seen as risky for a Democratic senator from a GOP state. He aligned himself with most of his Democratic colleagues against Gina Haspel, Trump's pick for CIA director, arguing that her record on enhanced interrogation techniques was unacceptable. And instead of focusing on a politically safe issue in his maiden Senate floor speech, Jones struck a nerve by calling for a dialogue on gun violence after the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida.

Several years later, the university is still facing a crisis. According to new reports, the University of Missouri is currently facing a $49 million budget shortfall. Additionally, the university has laid off 30 employees and eliminated 155 vacant positions.

The basic deal is well understood by policymakers in both countries, with U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly emphasizing his great personal relationship with the Saudi king and crown prince.

The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.

"I think he's terrific," Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., who also faces a tough re-election fight, said in an interview. "It's harder work when you're not interested in voting the party line. You've got to look at every issue from all sides." "I really have been pleasantly surprised how willing he is to tell Chuck Schumer to go fly a kite," she added, referring to the Senate minority leader.
3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.
“They’ve twisted American values,” she said in a follow-up phone interview. “A lot of them are anti-God, anti-religion and anti-military.”
In the survey, most say they are proud to be Americans, although Republicans feel that way more strongly (90 percent) than Democrats (61 percent). There is no consensus when asked about the country’s current course, though: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. “Overwhelming majorities of those in both parties and independents agree that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.”” USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll
The USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll of 1,004 adults, taken online June 26-27, has a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The survey is one of a year-long series on American values.
That's more than all but three Democratic senators (Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana), all of whom are from red states and facing re-election this fall.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
“We’ve never counted on America to intervene. That’s been clear since the first chemical attack on Ghouta in 2013,” he says. He adds that the rebels “will fight until the end, regardless of the US attitude”. Alaa al-Dweri, who repairs motorcycles, described a doomsday scenario playing out in his town of Busra al-Harir, as livestock roamed the streets and families drove to safety in packed cars. Dweri, who doesn’t own a car, managed to get his wife, three children and a few small bags on his motorbike.
In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners. Alas, he is wasting his time trying to shift the views of the Democratic Party, which has become ever more left-wing, if not outright socialist. I think it is time for Mr. James to become a Republican. Guy Randolph

It’s shocking that Mr. James is surprised by the positive economic results of less regulation and lower taxes.
Emergency officials found a man and a woman — both aged in their 40s — unconscious at a property in Amesbury, England, on Saturday. “It was initially believed that the two patients fell ill after using possibly heroin or crack cocaine from a contaminated batch of drugs,” Wiltshire Police said in a statement. “However, further testing is now ongoing to establish the substance which led to these patients becoming ill and we are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances surrounding this incident.”
Public Health England's @PHE_uk advice is currently: "Based upon the number of casualties affected, is that it is not believed that there is a significant health risk to the wider public. This will be continually assessed as further information becomes known." — Wiltshire Police (@wiltshirepolice) July 4, 2018
The force added that the pair "might have been exposed to an unknown substance."
He had a small team of allies and has built his political life with them. The big exception was during this election he realized astutely that no one can win by himself. He has built a large coalition that includes a far-right party completely opposed to progressive politics. He has done so because he needed them to win. How will he behave toward those members of his very odd coalition is anyone’s guess.
Peach Wars: Southern States Spar Over Which Has The Most Juice
It's a juicy rivalry complete with peach emoji and a well-timed "bless your heart." The agriculture departments in Georgia and South Carolina sparred on Twitter this week over which of them really deserves the title of Peach State. It started with a tweet from South Carolina's Department of Agriculture — an account off to a feisty start since it was created in June. The department claimed that South Carolina harvests three times more peaches than Georgia does. We know Georgia gets all the credit but SC actually harvests three times more peaches than GA 🍑 pic.twitter.com/W8OXoj5Sh1 — South Carolina Department of Agriculture (@SCDAgriculture) July 3, 2018

Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.
Lyft, like Uber, is moving beyond cars. The ride-hailing startup on Monday announced it will acquire Motivate, the largest bikeshare operator in North America. Motivate operates Citi Bike in New York and Capital Bikeshare in Washington DC, among other brands. The move comes as Lyft has been expanding its reach in the transportation space. It has integrated public transit in its app and introduced Lyft Line, which lets users share a ride with strangers who are going to destinations close together.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, Japan's government spokesman, confirmed the executions to The Associated Press and said authorities were taking precautions in case of any retaliation by his followers.

In addition to the 13 people who were killed, more than 1,000 others were sickened when plastic bags containing the poison were leaked on five subway lines on March 20, 1995. At least 4,000 more turned up at hospitals for treatment of anxiety and trauma reactions.
“The consensus is you are giving up a lot of control,” she said. That sentiment is growing in the advertising industry. Martin Sorrell, the former chief executive of the global ad firm WPP Group, wrote in an article for Wired's U.K. magazine that Amazon is now the dominant concern in the advertising industry. "The question I always ask my clients is, 'What keeps you awake at night?'"
Trump motioned to news media covering the Great Falls rally and said 75 percent "of those people are downright dishonest." His barbs against the media came on a day when newsrooms across the U.S. held a moment of silence in remembrance of five Maryland newspaper staffers who were fatally shot last week by a man who authorities say held a grudge against the publication. In a campaign stop that was both political and personal, Trump targeted Tester in a bid to get more Republicans elected to the Senate but also to punish the lawmaker he blames for derailing his nominee to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. Appearing in a state he dominated in 2016, Trump cast Tester as a "liberal Democrat," railing against his voting record on issues like abortion, immigration and taxes. While Tester opposed Trump's first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, and the Republican tax bill, he also took flak from the left for a bill easing the rules on banks.

Trump’s reckless comments about Maxine Waters
If the unthinkable were to happen and Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., were injured in any way by an assailant, the situation must be squarely laid at the feet of the president of the United States. There isn’t much ambiguity about this, anyone can connect the dots. More: Democrats took the bait from Donald Trump, it's not a winning strategy at the polls
President Donald Trump is playing with fire by calling Waters “crazy” and accusing her of corruption. The potential awful effects, which he can neither foresee nor control, are dangerous. Trump is playing with people’s lives.
They are to consult on detailed plans to restrict the promotion and marketing of foods high in salt, sugar and fat. This would target confectionary, biscuits, crisps, cakes, pastries, sugary soft drinks and potentially ice creams, and include restrictions on multi-buy offers, meal deals, unlimited refill deals and where products can be displayed in shops. Newly appointed public health minister Joe Fitzpatrick said "far too many people" were facing "serious risks to their health" which were "largely avoidable". 'Profound impact'
The new government report states that "the Scottish diet remains stubbornly unhealthy", with the country "far from meeting our dietary goals" - something which has a "profound" impact on health and lifestyle. Problems start early, with the report setting out "alarming" findings on the number of children consuming food and drinks high in fat or sugar - studies suggest 29% of children are at risk of being overweight, half of whom are at risk of obesity.
President Donald Trump is not responsible for the killing of journalists in Annapolis last week. His belittling of the press — his “enemy of the American people” taunts, his promises to roll back libel laws, his fomenting rage toward specific journalists at rallies — is worth mentioning within the context of the murders, because it speaks to a larger concern that last Thursday’s attack on The Capital Gazette won’t be an isolated incident. Journalists, many of whom already risk their lives covering war and violence, many of whom receive death threats regularly, feel understandable jitters about a leader who tries to turn the American public against us, particularly when we watch a member of that public shoot up a newsroom and end five lives. It’s reckless and inaccurate, though, to pin the shootings on Trump. The suspect swore an oath to kill a Capital writer who wrote about him in 2011.
“Some of these articles feature exaggerations or overgeneraliszations [sic]; for example, some claim that China is ‘world No.1’ in certain field.”
The problem with these pieces, the People’s Daily argued in this column, is that “they lack basic facts and deep thought.”
Should Xi implement this reform in the tone of Chinese state media, it would mean a significant change for the typical styles of the nation’s largest publications. In 2017 alone, Chinese state publications proclaimed that the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse scandal proves that “Chinese traditional values” are superior to Western ones; the Soviet Union failed because it lacked “Chinese culture”; and that the West was doomed to fail because Western leaders “always believe in absolute conquest.”
An extensive profile of Xi Jinping in the state outlet Xinhua last year also went out of its way to proclaim that the world is riveted by Xi and his ability to “make things happen,” as evidenced by the “numerous clicks and many thumbs-up on the Internet” his speeches and political commentary garner. The story featured an anecdote about a man who drank some of the ink he was using to translate the Communist Manifesto because “the taste of truth is so sweet.”
Not to be left behind, in December, the People’s Daily proclaimed, “A unique path, a unique theory, a unique system, a unique culture; Xi Jinping’s thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era has developed a rich path for China that has transcended Western-centric theory.”
The growing human rights movement within China has also become one of the most common targets of vitriol for state media. Shortly following the death of Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo last year, the Global Times called Liu and his supporters “losers” and dismissed their lives as a “waste.”
The People’s Daily message this week may be aimed for North Korea as much as it is for China, as Pyongyang prepares for what appears to be inevitable economic profit following dictator Kim Jong-un’s in-person meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. North Korean state media are more vitriolic and exaggerated than their Chinese counterpart, spending much of 2017 threatening a nuclear attack on the United States and sentencing Trump to death.

Durbin’s advocacy for mass-migration and for younger ‘dreamer’ illegals has caused the Democrats much political pain. He pushed for the abortive budget-shutdown in January 2018, and for the “Gang of Eight” amnesty bill in 2013 which helped the Democrats lose nine seats in 2014. The Democrats’ top leader in the Senate, Sen. Chuck Schumer, is keeping his distance from the “Abolish ICE” campaign. He is instead using his Twitter account to tout Democrats’ promises on healthcare, guns, gay status, and claims that President Donald Trump is tied to Russian President Vladimir Putin. On the Abolish ICE campaign, Schumer is instead calling for a “czar” to focus media attention on “reunifying families.” That topic polls better for Democrats than ending immigration enforcement.
They include the United States withdrawing its 28,500 troops in South Korea, ending its military drills with South Korea and stop bringing in strategic assets such as aircraft carriers and nuclear-capable bombers. North Korea hasn't repeated such specific demands since entering disarmament talks earlier this year, raising optimism that the country truly appeared to seek to improve ties with the United States. After the summit, Trump suspended annual military training with South Korea that the North has called an invasion rehearsal. But North Korea still prefers a step-by-step disarmament process with reciprocal concessions and benefits from the United States for each of the North's denuclearization steps. The ultimate rewards North Korea wants range from the easing or lifting of American-led international sanctions, the signing of a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, the establishment of diplomatic ties and the pulling out of U.S. troops in South Korea, experts say.

“I think he’s absolutely brilliant, with the right temperament,” McConnell told reporters over the weekend. But that political endorsement is backed up by many in the legal community who rave about Thapar. Louisville attorney Ned Pillersdorf, who calls himself a “Bernie Sanders Democrat,” told the Louisville Courier-Journal that Thapar is fair and judicial. “There are much, much worse Trump nominees they should go after...If I get to talk to Bernie, I’d say vote for him.” Thapar has shown he can be tough on both defendants and the government. He once sentenced a woman to 18 years in prison for assisting her jailed daughter to obtain drugs that killed her.
The proposal would:
Legalize the possession and sale of up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana for personal, recreational use for people over the age of 21. A person could keep up to 10 ounces of marijuana at home. Tax marijuana sales with a 10 percent excise tax at the retail level as well as the state's 6 percent sales tax. Split those revenues, with 35 percent going to K-12 education, 35 percent to roads, 15 percent to the communities that allow marijuana businesses in their communities and 15 percent to counties where marijuana business are located. Allow communities to decide whether they’ll allow marijuana businesses in their towns.

Bellock said she was not looking for a full-time job after she retired from the Illinois House, but the governor and his team asked her to head the health care and family services department. “I look at this as a real honor,” Bellock said. She has spent 20 years of her career on public policy related to health care and family issues and said she looks forward to working on the Better Care Illinois program. Although it’s a full-time job, “It’s not 24/7 like being a legislator,” Bellock said. “If you are an active legislator, you are working all the time.

"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.
On this much police and activist South Side priest Michael Pfleger can agree: Saturday morning’s anti-violence march on the Dan Ryan Expressway is all about danger. Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.

Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left a demoralized agency where staff fear their ability to protect public health is diminished
Scott Pruitt is out but his impact on the environment will be felt for years
Scott Pruitt, who has finally stepped down as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency after a long-rumbling corruption scandal, rose to public prominence on the back of a series of increasingly outlandish ethical controversies. Scott Pruitt resigns: Trump's scandal-ridden EPA chief steps down Read more
From lobbying fast food company Chick-fil-A on behalf of his wife, to demanding his staff acquire a mattress from a Trump Hotel – not to mention the millions of taxpayer dollars spent on security, first-class travel and soundproof booths – Pruitt’s behavior clashed spectacularly with any pretense of Trump’s pledge to “drain the swamp” in Washington. But the lasting legacy of the former Oklahoma attorney general – who was picked by Trump after crusading against what he called the EPA’s “activist agenda” – is likely to be felt in the systematic weakening of environmental regulations. While not as eye-catching as, for example, his demand that his official vehicle use sirens so he could reach a French restaurant on time, Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left behind a demoralized agency where staff fret that their ability to protect public health has been diminished. A staunch ally of oil and gas companies, Pruitt stacked EPA advisory boards with industry representatives and sought to set aside whole troves of research that link pollution to various illnesses.
The Circuit judge explained, “Under the provision of the immigration laws at issue here, mere economic expediency does not authorize an employer to displace American workers for foreign workers.”
Prominent conservative Ann Coulter has also called for Trump to nominate Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, arguing that other judges such as Thomas Hardiman and Raymond Kethledge “are open borders zealots.”

Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.
If anything, he’s just spray painted an old, rusty wagon wheel with the glitzy gold that, over the decades, he’s made synonymous with his own family name. But this era of bright screens and on-demand delivery seems to be clouding our minds, as though we’ve purposefully trained ourselves to focus on the shiny spray painted object in front of us and not on the more important stories unfolding just off our phone screens. While the founders envisioned a government that moved slowly and methodically, today’s Wi-Fi-enabled political discourse is demanding the opposite, and the allure of being one day’s internet sensation has drawn most all of us in like moths to a flame named Trump — the one steady, bright light that we all shamelessly, even helplessly, flitter towards even as we should know the momentary warmth is hiding the heat that will eventually be our own doom. Trump’s chaos theory of running companies is now on full display in the West Wing, but it’s also on display in the rest of us. He’s the made himself the center of our universe, and most of us are now unwittingly circling his orbit.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.

This animation shows how money allegedly misappropriated from 1MDB moved through global wealth centers before being used to buy real estate, art, and other assets around the world, including in New York and Beverley Hills. Illustration: Oliver Osborne for The Wall Street Journal. The U.S. Justice Department, via its civil lawsuits, is attempting to seize almost $2 billion in assets allegedly bought with 1MDB money. However, in August, the department asked a U.S. judge to suspend those cases while it focused on building a criminal investigation into 1MDB, which people familiar with the matter say is focusing on Mr. Low. Mr. Najib launched the 1MDB fund in 2009 as a way to spur investment in Malaysia, but it quickly racked up debts that now stand at $8 billion.
Crimes such as robbery remain rampant across Venezuela amid the country’s dire economic and humanitarian crisis, leading growing numbers of people to turn to violence merely to ensure survival. Kidnappings, armed robberies, and violent attacks are now commonplace. Venezuela is widely considered one of the most dangerous destinations in the world. As noted by El Nacional, “There are many travelers who have been stripped of money, luggage, and vehicles on the Caracas-La Guaira highway, especially at night and early morning when the road is little traveled and lacks surveillance.”
The doctors were present in Venezuela as part of an agreement between the two countries. Venezuela typically pays for the doctors in vast quantities of oil, an initiative that started under Hugo Chávez and Fidel Castro.
Disputes around the funding of continuing care have become a major industry. The recent NHS funding announcement, making no reference whatsoever to social care, evidenced the fact that the government still hasn’t the least idea of how the two are umbilically linked. From as far back as 1998 to as recently as last month, the health select committee has argued for properly joined-up provision. The Treasury opposes a formal integration but continuing separation is costing billions in terms of delayed discharges and other inefficiencies. David Hinchliffe

Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.
NEW YORK — House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) has referred 15 individuals, including longtime Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal, for possible “open setting” testimony in the ongoing Russia investigation. The list was sent to House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA). Many of the names are tied to the discredited anti-Trump dossier produced by the controversial Fusion GPS firm, which was paid for its dossier work by both Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) via the Perkins Coie lawfirm. Indeed, Perkins Coie attorney Marc E. Elias, who reportedly was involved in arranging the payments that resulted in the dossier, made the Nunes list. As did Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson.
The strategy reprises last year's successful approach to confirming Justice Neil Gorsuch in the early spring of 2017. Gorsuch was named to fill the vacancy left by the death of Antonin Scalia and then kept open by the refusal of the Senate's Republican majority to consider Merrick Garland, the replacement named by President Barack Obama in 2016. Gorsuch was greeted with delight by abortion opponents, even though he had not ruled directly on Roe in his judicial career. But his confirmation was far from a sure thing because two Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, were seen as defenders of abortion rights.

Nebraska May Join Utah, Idaho in Putting Medicaid Expansion Before Voters
Enlarge this image toggle caption Fred Knapp/NET News Fred Knapp/NET News
Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.
"It's not a unique business," Troia said. "In this case, they just got caught with the door open." Two days after news of that leak broke, a data breach at the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training at Texas State University exposed the personal information of thousands of law enforcement officers. In that case, which was first reported by ZDNet, the personal info was stored on an unsecured web server, a university spokesman told CNNMoney. Data breaches can happen to anyone, of course -- just ask Equifax (EFX), which experienced a hack that exposed the personal information of over 147 million people last fall.
In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners.

I think it is time for Mr. James to become a Republican. Guy Randolph

It’s shocking that Mr. James is surprised by the positive economic results of less regulation and lower taxes.
But while ICE has arrested hundreds of MS-13 gang members in recent months, according to data provided to The New York Times, the law enforcement agency has a broader mission. The calls for getting rid of the agency come as the Trump administration continues to enforce a "zero tolerance" policy of prosecuting adults who illegally cross the border. The policy led to family separations and drew backlash around the country. 3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months.

Experts Skeptical That North Korea Is Serious About Denuclearizing
Enlarge this image toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is heading back to North Korea on Thursday to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and other senior officials. His mission: to flesh out the details of a vaguely worded joint declaration that Kim signed with President Trump in Singapore last month. In that document, the U.S. pledges security guarantees for North Korea, while North Korea commits to "work toward a complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula." There are doubts, though, about how serious Pyongyang is about doing that. After announcing Pompeo's trip to Pyongyang on Monday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders got a barrage of questions about reports that North Korea is expanding sites tied to its nuclear weapons program and that U.S. intelligence officials don't think Kim intends to relinquish his nuclear arsenal.
The proposal would:
Legalize the possession and sale of up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana for personal, recreational use for people over the age of 21. A person could keep up to 10 ounces of marijuana at home. Tax marijuana sales with a 10 percent excise tax at the retail level as well as the state's 6 percent sales tax. Split those revenues, with 35 percent going to K-12 education, 35 percent to roads, 15 percent to the communities that allow marijuana businesses in their communities and 15 percent to counties where marijuana business are located. Allow communities to decide whether they’ll allow marijuana businesses in their towns.
“I cannot blame our president for saying that if he was being given wrong information and information meant to hurt and malign people who are doing good,” she said. “If our president would visit us, be with us every day, spend every day with us, he would know the truth.”

The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. Teachers are also running a ballot measure campaign that would tax the highest income earners for an additional $690 million to spend on schools. “Regardless of political parties, we need people to make a decision about what’s happening in the classroom,” said Marisol Garcia, vice president of the Arizona Education Association. “To limit ourselves and to say ‘only these people are going to support us’ is just not true.”
Teachers can be at a disadvantage compared to wealthier candidates, who tend to have built-in networks of potential donors.

Families old and young joined together to show their strength at the Round Lake Beach Families Belong Together rally Sunday afternoon. The rally at Round Lake Beach was part of a larger event held in all 50 states over the weekend, including Saturday’s rally in Highland Park, that centered on denouncing President Donald Trump and his administration's controversial immigration policy that has separated children from their parents. “He definitely needs to be held accountable for what he’s done,” said Round Lake Beach Families Belong Together organizer Jill Birdwell. Trump has since signed an executive order to block the separation of undocumented families attempting to enter the country, but Birdwell believes that’s not enough to undo damage the policy has caused. “There’s no guarantee that they'll go back with their parents again, and beside all the torture they've gone though, they are going to need a lot of help and support and psychological help and emotional help through all this,” Birdwell said.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

But after maintaining months of silence as to what it has endured, or what exactly the military's complaints are, Dawn recently published a frank and stinging editorial. The editorial describes its important, factual reporting about the serious rift between civil and military authorities during the Nawaz Sharif government, which had infuriated the military, and Dawn's insistence on protecting the sources for its stories - a basic element of media ethics worldwide. The editorial states that "a campaign of disinformation, libel and slander, hate and virtual incitement to violence against Dawn and its staff has necessitated placing certain matters on record". It added that elements "within or sections of the state" are not upholding constitutional freedoms.
Practice is only one of Deborah Glass’s 125 recommendations not accepted by Victorian government
Female prisoners in Victoria are still subject to “abusive” routine strip searches, a state government watchdog says. The Victorian ombudsman, Deborah Glass, said the government has failed to adopt a recommendation from her 2015 report into the prison system that called for an end to the searches. “Why has the government not accepted my recommendation to stop the abusive practice of routinely strip-searching women prisoners – in fact, the only recommendation out of 125 not accepted?” she asked on Wednesday. The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year.
Federal Reserve officials last month said they expect to keep raising interest rates and suggested that by the next year, they could be high enough that they could start slowing growth, according to minutes of their discussion released Thursday. While noting a strong economy, Fed officials appeared vigilant about emerging risks, especially trade tensions, and the dangers of an economy that might overheat. The officials noted heightened concerns from businesses about President Donald Trump's get-tough trade policies and that some executives had already scaled back future spending plans because of the uncertainty. They also said they were monitoring changes in market-set interest rates. A narrowing in the gap between short-term and long-term rates has been an accurate predictor of downturns in the past.

Trade ministers and officials from 16 Asian countries agreed Sunday to speed up negotiations on outstanding issues and reach a basic agreement on a regional trade pact by the end of this year. During weekend meetings, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe urged fellow leaders to work for an early conclusion of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership in the face of an increasingly protectionist U.S.
Japan has sought to take leadership in shaping the pact as an alternative to a Pacific Rim free-trade grouping that Trump abandoned early this year, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. At a joint news conference Sunday after the talks, Japanese Economy, Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshige Seko and his Singaporean counterpart, Chan Chun Sing, noted there are differences that still need to be resolved, but the participants see reaching an accord as evidence of Asia's commitment to defending free trade. "This is indeed a moment for us to seize the opportunity against a global backdrop where we are facing headwinds in the trade relationships and the trade regimes," Chan said. Achieving a pact would be a powerful statement to show what RCEP countries stand for, he said.

Avenatti's former law firm, Eagan Avenatti LLP, agreed to make the roughly $452,000 tax payment last month in order to resolve a bankruptcy case, but the funds never arrived at the IRS, according to a filing Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, Calif.

He oversaw the delay or destruction of dozens of clean air and water rules, sparking legal battles with states and environmental groups. The EPA’s record in court under Pruitt was patchy but his deregulatory zeal was enough to impress Trump, who said Pruitt was doing a “fantastic job” even as scandals that sparked more than a dozen different investigations swirled around him. Pruitt became a trusted advisor to Trump, helping convince the president the US should withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.

David Shulkin, Veterans Affairs Secretary - 28 March 2018
A doctor, he had served as undersecretary of veterans affairs for health under Barack Obama. President Trump had hailed him as "fantastic" when appointing him, and the Senate gave him the only 100-0 confirmation of the Trump team.
Bishop John Bauerschmidt, who oversees the Middle Tennessee region of the church, stands firmly by his decision not to authorize their use, nor allow clergy within his diocese to officiate the religious ceremonies or permit the weddings on church property. In doing so, the bishop says he is being faithful to his job of guarding the discipline, faith and unity of the church.

"The teaching that Christian marriage is between a man and a woman is reasonable, traditional, and scriptural," Bauerschmidt said in an email. "There really is nothing remarkable about a Christian bishop who holds to this teaching." While Bishops can place limitations on the use of the marriage liturgies, they must refer couples to a willing diocese if they do not authorize them.
Scott Pruitt has resigned as head of the Environmental Protection Agency after a string of controversies involving his leadership, President Trump announced Thursday on Twitter. "Within the Agency Scott has done an outstanding job, and I will always be thankful to him for this," tweeted Trump, who added that EPA Deputy Administrator Andrew Wheeler would take over as acting administrator effective Monday. "I have no doubt that Andy will continue on with our great and lasting EPA agenda," Trump concluded. "We have made tremendous progress and the future of the EPA is very bright!" In his resignation letter to Trump, Pruitt said: "It is extremely difficult for me to cease serving you in this role first because I count it a blessing to be serving you in any capacity, but also, because of the transformative work that is occurring.
Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.

Another one of Zittlau’s asylum clients was repeatedly raped and beaten by her husband in Guatemala. She went to the police for help, but they dismissed her claims and told her to apologize to her husband, Zittlau said. She continued to endure the abuse until she learned that her husband was molesting one of her children. She came to the U.S. last February with two of her daughters. Part of the struggle, Zittlau said, is conveying to her clients that assault shouldn’t be a part of everyday life.

Referendum to remove ‘outdated’ clause encouraging mothers to choose domestic duties over paid employment to be held by November
Ireland to vote over constitution clause on women's role in the home
Ireland will hold a referendum to remove a clause in the constitution marking the importance of a woman’s “life within the home” and encouraging mothers to shun paid employment to fulfil domestic duties, the government has announced. The move unveiled on Thursday is the latest to update Ireland’s socially conservative 1937 constitution to reflect a more secular and socially liberal population. Ireland was long one of Europe’s most socially conservative countries, but opinions have changed rapidly in recent decades as the power of the Roman Catholic church has waned. A 2015 referendum introduced gay marriage into the constitution and a vote earlier this year allowed access to abortion. The constitution, which includes a number of references to the country’s traditional Christian ethos, currently contains a clause that “recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the state a support without which the common good cannot be achieved”.
Even Pruitt’s own staff had begun to sour on him, with many worrying that their future career prospects would be damaged by their association with Pruitt’s tenure. Each scandal seemed more damning than the last. Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.
In their statement, Mr Netanyahu and Mr Morawiecki praised the Polish wartime government-in-exile, saying it tried to "raise awareness among Western allies of the systematic murder" of Polish Jews. They also said structures of the Polish underground state supervised by the Polish government-in-exile "created a mechanism of systematic help and support to Jewish people". However Yad Vashem said this contradicted decades of historical research and contained "grave errors and deceptions". It said much of the Polish resistance in its various movements "not only failed to help Jews, but was also not infrequently actively involved in persecuting them". Polish assistance to Jews during the Holocaust was "relatively rare", Yad Vashem said, and "attacks against and even the murder of Jews were widespread".
Straight-A students are being turned away from British medical schools and forced to pay for training in Eastern Europe, while the National Health Service (NHS) plunders the Third World for already-trained doctors instead. The Daily Mail spoke to a number of star students who earned top A-levels and supplemented their CVs with spells volunteering at local GP surgeries, overseas clinics, hospices, and pharmacies — and even earned degrees in related fields such as Biomedical Science — who were turned away from British medical schools, despite the NHS facing a shortfall of some 10,000 doctors. Department of Health and Social Care figures show that only 6,000 of 18,000 medical school applicants were awarded places last year — with many of the 6,000 likely going to foreign applicants, who have often been favoured over British applicants. In fact, the Mail found that so many talented would-be medical students were being rejected that a cottage industry of English-language medical schools in countries such as Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Armenia, and Georgia have sprung up to cater to them — but even this option is not available to youngsters who cannot afford the fees.

HTC is laying off 1,500 people after years of losing money and market share. The struggling Taiwanese smartphone manufacturer confirmed Monday that it is downsizing as part of a broader "realignment of resources across the organization." It expects to complete the layoffs by September. "HTC continues to review its operations to ensure production resources align with key strategic initiatives, so that the company can more effectively compete in its target markets while maintaining its innovative edge," an HTC spokesperson said in a statement provided to CNNMoney. Despite critical acclaim for phones like the HTC One, the company has seen its share of the market decline steadily amid stiff competition from Apple and Samsung.
Nebraska May Join Utah, Idaho in Putting Medicaid Expansion Before Voters
Enlarge this image toggle caption Fred Knapp/NET News Fred Knapp/NET News
Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.
Michael Avenatti told POLITICO that he's being targeted over his political views. | Seth Wenig/AP Photo Feds target Avenatti over old firm's unpaid taxes U.S. Attorney accuses Trump critic of 'misrepresentations' and 'misconduct.' U.S. Government lawyers are slamming one of President Donald Trump's most prominent critics, attorney Michael Avenatti, over nearly half a million dollars in unpaid federal taxes owed by his former firm. Avenatti's former law firm, Eagan Avenatti LLP, agreed to make the roughly $452,000 tax payment last month in order to resolve a bankruptcy case, but the funds never arrived at the IRS, according to a filing Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, Calif.

His stance put Mrs Merkel's coalition and her political future in question. Late on Sunday, Mrs Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) passed a resolution supporting her position on migration. CDU General Secretary Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said the party believed a European solution was necessary. But separate reports from sources within the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the CSU, indicated Mr Seehofer had offered to resign both as leader of the CSU and as interior minister. Both parties spent Sunday discussing the deal on immigration Mrs Merkel fought hard to reach at last week's European Union summit.

"I really have been pleasantly surprised how willing he is to tell Chuck Schumer to go fly a kite," she added, referring to the Senate minority leader. At other times, however, Jones has taken up liberal positions seen as risky for a Democratic senator from a GOP state. He aligned himself with most of his Democratic colleagues against Gina Haspel, Trump's pick for CIA director, arguing that her record on enhanced interrogation techniques was unacceptable. And instead of focusing on a politically safe issue in his maiden Senate floor speech, Jones struck a nerve by calling for a dialogue on gun violence after the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida.
'We’re going to run different'
His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
POLITICO Playbook: Michael Cohen speaks
NEW YORK, NY - MAY 30: Michael Cohen, (C) former personal lawyer and confidante for President Donald Trump, exits the United States District Court Southern District of New York on May 30, 2018 in New York City. According to a filing submitted to the court Tuesday night by special master Barbara Jones, federal prosecutors investigating Michael Cohen, a longtime personal lawyer and confidante for President Donald Trump, are set to receive 1 million files from three of his cellphones that were seized last month.

"But when I pointed out to Cohen that he wasn’t repeating past vows to 'take a bullet' and 'do anything' to protect the president, the longtime Trump loyalist left little doubt about where he stands now, saying simply: 'To be crystal clear, my wife, my daughter and my son, and this country have my first loyalty.'

— MINING: The EPA said last year that it won't require mining companies to prove they have the financial resources to clean up pollution, an Obama-era rule stemming from a long history of pollution spilling from abandoned mines into streams. Pruitt said modern mining practices and existing regulations made the financial requirement unnecessary and a burden on mining. — AUTOS: Pruitt's EPA has proposed freezing vehicle fuel-efficiency standards at 2020 levels for the next five years, according to a draft of the proposal obtained by Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del. For new vehicles, that means an average of about 30 miles per gallon instead of rising to 36 mpg by 2025 as Obama's EPA proposed. — OIL AND GAS: More than a dozen states are suing the EPA for failing to take action against leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, from oil and natural gas wells.
Sweeney formed a tax study group earlier this year that recommended several ways to pare down public workers' health and pension benefits, including putting new employees in a 401(k)-style system instead of a traditional pension system. The Senate president, during the budget negotiations, attempted to get Murphy to commit to overhauling public employee benefits within the year, according to a source familiar with the talks, and at one point handed out the report from the tax study group to those in the room. The roots of the conflict date to the fall of 2016. What was shaping up to be a three-man race for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination between Murphy, Sweeney and Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop ended unexpectedly when Fulop announced he would not run and would instead back Murphy. North Jersey’s Democratic elected officials and party leaders, eager to erode the ever-increasing influence of South Jersey Democrats led by Sweeney and his close friend, power broker George Norcross, immediately threw their support behind Murphy.

While the US tariffs aim to cut down the trade deficit, there are worries about how China's retaliatory tariffs will hit the US economy. The US Chamber of Commerce says some states will have billions of dollars worth of exports at risk. States such as Louisiana export about $5.7bn of goods to China. Several southern states, many of which also backed Trump in the election, also risk being hit.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”

Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups. According to the New York Times, the Supreme court’s decision will affect these left-wing groups and causes. “If the progressive movement is a navy, they’re trying to take out our aircraft carriers,” said Ben Wikler, of MoveOn.org, the Times reported. However, progressive groups are optimistic that the loss of union funds will be compensated for with grass-roots activism.

"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.

That has not been true of all past presidents. Andrew Jackson famously dismissed a court decision against his forced removal of the Cherokees from Georgia by saying: “The chief justice has made his ruling. Now let him enforce it.” As for today’s controversial immigration policies separating children from parents, they are, sadly, legal - a reminder that something may be immoral but not also illegal, and also a reminder that laws must be continually revised to reflect our highest societal moral standards. The Trump administration has also become adept at finding obscure, long dormant “national security” clauses in the federal codex to invoke as justification for steel and aluminum tariffs as well as punitive tariffs on Chinese goods (the latter has been announced but not yet enacted). These may be stupid policy, but they are not illegal - yet.

Of the challenge, Freeman says: “I have a personal and family background in the health service, and I have nothing but admiration for every person who works in our NHS whatever their job is. There have always been challenges and demands on the NHS and that will continue. I will continue and build on the commitment and excellent work of Shona Robison, my predecessor. One of the successes of our health service is that people are living longer, and that puts different demands on it. So it is critical that we are, together, able to adapt and change to meet those demands.”

At least 12 people have reportedly been taken into custody in connection with a lynching of five people in Dhule, India. An incited crowd killed the five villagers after a rumor circulating on Whatsapp fueled speculation that they were child kidnappers, according to The Associated Press and local media reports. The group of men were cornered by dozens of people as they were passing through a village, the AP said. The men were all members of a nomadic community who pass through villages in order to beg, local newspaper The Hindu reported. One of the men was seen talking to a girl, which prompted questions from villagers that escalated into violence as more people gathered around, according to the newspaper.
There never was a rational reason for creating a “buffer zone.” This attendance status allowed enrollment at either Central or South high schools.

"The president of the republic and his government will be absolutely respectful and support the authorities that are elected," Pena Nieto told reporters. Hovering over the election is the specter of vote fraud, though electoral officials deny it is a possibility with the modern balloting technology and institutions now in place. In both of Lopez Obrador's previous two presidential losses he alleged fraud. In his first loss — by a mere 0.56 percent to conservative Felipe Calderon in 2006 — his supporters held months-long protests in Mexico City and he referred to himself as "the legitimate president." His allies are warning even before Sunday's presidential vote that there better not be any funny business.
“We are not going to fight. We are always going to seek for there to be an agreement. … We are going to extend our frank hand to seek a relation of friendship, I repeat, of cooperation with the United States.”
Trump was equally tactful, telling reporters: “I think he’s going to try and help us with the border. “I think the relationship will be a very good one,” the US president said of the Mexican politician, whose swearing-in will be in December. “We talked about trade, we talked about Nafta, we talked about a separate deal, just Mexico and the United States.”
Such restraint contrasted with Trump’s call to López Obrador’s predecessor, weeks after his inauguration last year.

The strategy reprises last year's successful approach to confirming Justice Neil Gorsuch in the early spring of 2017. Gorsuch was named to fill the vacancy left by the death of Antonin Scalia and then kept open by the refusal of the Senate's Republican majority to consider Merrick Garland, the replacement named by President Barack Obama in 2016. Gorsuch was greeted with delight by abortion opponents, even though he had not ruled directly on Roe in his judicial career. But his confirmation was far from a sure thing because two Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, were seen as defenders of abortion rights.

PORTLAND, Ore. -- Two opposing protest groups -- Patriot Prayer and antifa -- clashed in downtown Portland Saturday, CBS Portland affiliate KOIN reports. Portland police said failure to leave the area could leave to arrests, calling the demonstration a riot. More than 100 members of Patriot Prayer group gathered at Terry Schrunk Plaza for a "freedom rally," while more than 100 counter protesters with an antifa group gathered across the street at Chapman Square for rallies before a march. Police revoked Patriot Prayer's permit for the rally after the two groups began to clash. People were lighting firecrackers and smoke bombs in the crowd while police used flash bangs in an effort to disperse the clashing protesters.
The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said. Carney said the impact from the president’s use of import tariffs against major trading partners including the EU and China, alongside their retaliatory measures, was already being seen through measures of global exports and manufacturing in recent weeks. “There are some tentative signs that this more hostile and uncertain trading environment may be dampening activity,” he said. Surveys of factory output in the US and the eurozone earlier this week showed firms were facing higher prices as a consequence of the import tariffs, as well as American manufacturers having the longest delivery delays on record.
As motorists pay more to fill their tanks this Independence Day -- with gas prices at a four-year high for the holiday -- safety advocates are urging caution during celebrations that turn deadly on U.S. roadways. The national average for a gallon of gas on Tuesday stood at $2.86, making it the costliest for an Independence Day holiday in four years, according to AAA. That said, the nearly 40 million motorists expected to travel this week will pay 11 cents less per gallon at the pump than they did this past Memorial Day holiday, the motorist club noted. "The national gas price average has held fairly steady for the past 10 days, suggesting that U.S. demand is keeping pace with supply and stabilizing summer gas prices," a spokesperson for the motorist group said in a statement. "However, elevated crude oil prices and other geopolitical concerns could tilt gas prices more expensive in the early fall despite an expected increase in global crude production from OPEC and its partners."
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., all floated as possible 2020 presidential candidates, have backed the call to abolish the agency. "The president's deeply immoral actions have made it obvious we need to rebuild our immigration system from top to bottom starting by replacing ICE with something that reflects our morality and that works," Warren said on Saturday. Pence, in his speech Friday, blasted those Democrats and said it was a sign that "opposition of ICE has moved to the center of the Democratic Party." "Just when you thought the Democrats couldn’t move any farther to the left, leading members of the Democratic Party, including candidates for higher officer, are actually openly advocating the abolition of ICE – an agency that protects the American people and our communities every single day."

Authorities in Oregon are urging hikers and other outdoors enthusiasts to avoid forested areas near the Oregon-California border, where a blaze has killed one person. The Jackson County Sheriff's Office said Friday that although the blaze has not crossed into Oregon, officials are concerned people in remote areas could be unreachable in case they need to quickly evacuate. It says the areas of concern include the Pacific Crest Trail, Mount Ashland and the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument.
While Blackstone Vice President Tony James offered some useful common-sense economic and political advice for Democrats, it was a bit of a head-scratcher to read his unsubstantiated declaration that “some of the current expansion is built on the foundation laid by the Obama administration.” Mr. James’s praise for the previous administration sounds a lot like the laughable claim by President Obama himself that America’s current economic vitality and growth are really due to the fact that he had the economy “set up well” for Mr. Trump. If by “set up well,” President Obama meant that the economy had been driven so far into the ground and smothered by excessive regulation and high taxes that almost anything that followed his antibusiness policies would be a success, then there would have been some merit in his claim. But does anyone think that’s what he’s saying?While Blackstone Vice President Tony James offered some useful common-sense economic and political advice for Democrats, it was a bit of a head-scratcher to read his unsubstantiated declaration that “some of the current expansion is built on the foundation laid by the Obama administration.” Mr. James’s praise for the previous administration sounds a lot like the laughable claim by President Obama himself that America’s current economic vitality and growth are really due to the fact that he had the economy “set up well” for Mr. Trump.While Blackstone Vice President Tony James offered some useful common-sense economic and political advice for Democrats, it was a bit of a head-scratcher to read his unsubstantiated declaration that “some of the current expansion is built on the foundation laid by the Obama administration.” Mr. James’s praise for the previous administration sounds a lot like the laughable claim by President Obama himself that America’s current economic vitality and growth are really due to the fact that he had the economy “set up well” for Mr. Trump.
Findings by the intelligence community that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election to help Donald Trump win were "accurate and on point," said an unclassified report by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released Tuesday. The committee's findings came after a lengthy review of the "sources, tradecraft and analytic work underpinning" a January 2017 intelligence community assessment. The FBI's and CIA's "analytical disagreement" with the NSA over whether Russia sought to bolster the Trump presidential campaign was "reasonable," the report also said. While the FBI and CIA had "high confidence" that Russian President Vladimir Putin aspired to help Trump's election chances by denigrating opponent Hillary Clinton, the NSA had only "moderate confidence" in that assessment, according to the January 2017 analysis. The disagreement among agencies "was reasonable, transparent, and openly debated among the agencies and analysts, with analysts, managers and agency heads on both sides of the confidence level articulately justifying their positions," the Senate intelligence committee's findings said.

In its statement, Delancey said it remained committed to ensuring the continued maintenance of the centre but added that it was over 50 years old, “and as is often the way with older buildings, some elements do unfortunately fail”. The delay in repairing the escalator was because it was so old, spare parts were no longer made and had to be specially manufactured, the spokeswoman said. The shopping centre has long attracted scorn and been dismissed as an eyesore – not least because of its “manky, hot-pink” exterior, as Time Out once put it – but some see that as part of its charm, with the Guardian’s property section once describing it approvingly as the “anti-Westfield”.

3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.
PORTLAND, Ore. -- Two opposing protest groups -- Patriot Prayer and antifa -- clashed in downtown Portland Saturday, CBS Portland affiliate KOIN reports. Portland police said failure to leave the area could leave to arrests, calling the demonstration a riot. More than 100 members of Patriot Prayer group gathered at Terry Schrunk Plaza for a "freedom rally," while more than 100 counter protesters with an antifa group gathered across the street at Chapman Square for rallies before a march. Police revoked Patriot Prayer's permit for the rally after the two groups began to clash. People were lighting firecrackers and smoke bombs in the crowd while police used flash bangs in an effort to disperse the clashing protesters.
Most of the incidents involved the amputation of fingers or fingertips, but there were recordings of lost hands, arms or toes. During the period there were a total of 550 serious injuries which cover 22 of the 50 states so the true total for the USA would be substantially higher. Recorded injuries include:
An employee’s left arm had to be surgically amputated at the shoulder after it was pulled into the cubing machine during sanitation
A worker was reaching down to pick up a box to clear a jam when his jacket became caught in a roller. As he tried to pull it out, his hand got pulled in as well. His hand and lower arm were crushed
While an employee was attempting to remove the ribs from the spine of a cattle rib set, his hand made contact with a running vertical band saw and two of his fingers were amputated
An employee working on a sanitation crew pushed the stop button after removing parts from the upper portion of a machine.
Elections frenzy continues in emerging markets and after Turkey last week, it’s Mexico’s turn on Sunday. Polls predict that former Mexico City mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will be the next president, possibly garnering over half of the votes. This is the third bid for the key job by AMLO as the leftist Lopez Obrador is commonly known; his popularity has grown hand in hand with Mexicans’ anger at the failure of traditional parties to end record levels of violence and corruption. His history of protest politics has unnerved investors though and while throughout this campaign AMLO has courted Wall Street, he has still pledged to review a 2013 opening of the oil industry to private producers. The vote comes at a delicate point for Mexico, which is at odds with the United States over migration and trade, while talks on reworking the NAFTA trade agreement are deadlocked.

Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
ZTE is far from alone. China assembles some 90 percent of the world's smartphones, computers and other electronics. But most of the revenue flows to American companies that supply computer chips and other technology. In the broader economy, Chinese banks, airlines, farms and other industries need U.S. technology from jetliners to drugs to software. What Washington welcomes as a source of well-paid jobs, Chinese leaders consider a dangerous dependence.
However, they admit it will produce power only about 11 per cent of the time. The output of the nearby Medway gas-fired power station is 735MW, but this is continuous. If the British government has any sense it will give this green vanity project the same treatment it did to the similarly stupid Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon Project and pull the plug before any more taxpayers’ money is poured down the drain. Unfortunately, though, the decision is in the hands of Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Greg Clark. Clark, a passionate Europhile, also happens to be the dreariest and most drippingly wet Conservative in Theresa May’s cabinet.

Our Founding Fathers resolved that without freedom Americans could not enjoy life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. To secure it, they fought a war to break free from the bonds of tyranny. It isn’t a faraway tyrant that oppresses us today. Rather, we are in the grip of a new kind of tyranny — that of mistrust. This tyrant sits on a throne in our minds and is just as cruel as King George was during the time of the Founders.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.
This account of the previously undisclosed conversation comes from a senior administration official familiar with what was said. In an exchange that lasted around five minutes, McMaster and others took turns explaining to Trump how military action could backfire and risk losing hard-won support among Latin American governments to punish President Nicolas Maduro for taking Venezuela down the path of dictatorship, according to the official. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the discussions. Although he gave no indication he was about to order up military plans, he pointed to what he considered past cases of successful gunboat diplomacy in the region, according to the official, like the invasions of Panama and Grenada in the 1980s.

A major North Sea wind power development off Aberdeen which was opposed by Donald Trump has generated its first power. A total of 11 turbines make up the European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre (EOWDC). Power from the wind farm, developed by Swedish energy group Vattenfall, is being exported to the National Grid. Mr Trump battled unsuccessfully in the courts to halt the project before he became US president. He said they would spoil the view from his Aberdeenshire golf course at Menie.

California is dismantling its protective custody program for vulnerable inmates after the population boomed and spawned problems of its own with gangs, drugs and assaults. WHEN DID THE PROGRAM START? The state began identifying certain vulnerable inmates as needing special protective housing in the late 1990s, and created so-called Sensitive Needs Yards for them starting in early 2002. More than 40 of the yards are now scattered within 20 of California's 34 prisons. WHAT ARE SENSITIVE NEEDS YARDS?

Hope Life Center in western Illinois provides unplanned pregnancy counseling and ultrasounds for about five to 10 women a week, with a mission to “erase abortion from Illinois one woman and one child at time,” according to its website. So Executive Director Debbie Case was alarmed by a change last year in the state's so-called right-of-conscience law, requiring health care providers to inform pregnant patients of all available medical options, including abortion. She said the pregnancy center even shut down for part of 2017 because its physician feared potential repercussions of violating the law, which is now temporarily blocked by the courts. Case and other anti-abortion advocates across the state hailed Tuesday’s ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court against a similar law in California on First Amendment grounds, hoping the decision will strengthen their legal battle in Illinois. “We’re definitely encouraged,” said Case, whose center is in Sterling, about two hours west of Chicago.
Among those reported to be among the top of President Donald Trump’s short list is Judge Brett Kavanaugh on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The prospect of a Justice Kavanaugh worries some consumer advocates, who say he has taken an activist position against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the regulator implemented in the wake of the Great Recession in the hopes of thwarting future financial meltdowns. “Kavanaugh’s track record has shown tremendous sympathy to political rhetoric, more so than to established precedent as it relates to the Bureau,” said Aaron Klein, director of the Center on Regulation and Markets at the Brookings Institution. “His ruling was closer to congressional talking points than legal precedent.”
Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center, said that the center doesn’t weigh in on potential judicial appointees, but that open hostility to the agency’s mission would be cause for concern. “Obviously, it would be concerning if there was a justice that was inclined to invalidate the CFPB,” she said.

On the Fourth of July, 1852, America celebrated its freedom, as it does every Independence Day. Frederick Douglass, America’s most famous anti-slavery activist and fugitive slave, saw no ground to celebrate: he saw the octopus arms of slavery stretched everywhere, exposing the hollowness of America’s freedom values. That holiday, he delivered the greatest antislavery speech in American history. Not least since the racism that made slavery endures.

The report also said that Strzok repeatedly pushed for more aggressive action in the Clinton probe. "The conduct by these employees cast a cloud over the entire FBI investigation and sowed doubt about the FBI’s work," the report concluded. "The damage caused by these employees’ actions extends far beyond the scope of the (Clinton) investigation and goes to the heart of the FBI’s reputation for neutral fact finding and political independence." Goelman, in an op-ed in USA TODAY last month, said Strzok has become the victim of "political gamesmanship" by Congress and President Trump, who has repeatedly tweeted about Strzok as evidence of bias by the FBI and Justice Department. "They have spent months cynically taking these texts out of context and saying that one- or two-word snippets somehow prove that the FBI investigations of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the Russia probe itself, were biased," Goelman wrote.

A recurring insult being used is "Natashas" - a derogatory term used to describe girls and young women who end up being sold as sex slaves after having been lured by the promises of legitimate employment. But the disrespectful treatment of women isn't contained online - some traditional media outlets have also joined in. The daily Moskovsky Komsomolets published an article with the headline "The time of whores: Russians in the World Cup disgrace themselves and the country". On TV, the topic was discussed on Channel One's programme Time Will Show, where potentially gullible women should be reminded "these men are just here for a holiday".

It has been 536 days since power-sharing in Northern Ireland collapsed - 536 days without ministers to oversee the running of Stormont's nine departments. In the absence of an executive, civil servants were left uncertain about what decisions to take, and who should take them. The long-running court case over the proposed Arc21 waste incinerator in County Antrim raised questions about exactly that conundrum. The judgement upholding a ruling that a senior civil servant did not have the power to act without ministerial approval in the case of the incinerator could have massive implications for future governance in Northern Ireland. Here are some of the key parts of the judgement and what they mean.

STAT OF THE DAY, via WaPo’s Abigail Hauslohner and Andrew Ba Tran: “The number of people receiving visas to move permanently to the United States is on pace to drop 12 percent in President Trump’s first two years in office, according to a Washington Post analysis of State Department data. “Among the most affected are the Muslim-majority countries on the president’s travel ban list -- Yemen, Syria, Iran, Libya and Somalia -- where the number of new arrivals to the United States is heading toward an 81 percent drop by Sept. 30, the end of the second fiscal year under Trump.” https://wapo.st/2tODvE0

LOUIE! Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, says it’s possible that staff for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein are monitoring his actions. ‘I’ve been told in the past there’s been great concern about who I saw, what I did and that I was being monitored and was even told they know everybody that walks in your office,’ Gohmert said Monday in an interview on Fox Business’s ‘Lou Dobbs Tonight.’” (via Washington Examiner).
Just hours after his historic election victory sent thousands of supporters pouring on to the streets, the 64-year-old leftist tweeted that he had received a call from Donald Trump. “I proposed that we explore an integral agreement of development projects, which generate jobs in Mexico and with that reduce migration and improve security. There was respectful treatment and our representatives will speak more.”
In an interview with the Televisa news network, López Obrador emphasized the need for mutual respect and cooperation between the two neighbors. “We are conscious of the need to maintain good relations with the United States. We have a border of more than 3,000 kilometers, more than 12 million Mexicans live in the United States.

“I think the relationship will be a very good one,” he said – qualifying the comment as he often does by saying, “We’ll see what happens.”
“He had a very excellent election that, I would say, even better than anticipated,” said President Trump, who told a story about years ago predicting Obrador’s election to the office of President in Mexico. “I told him a number of years ago when I saw him campaigning for a different race, frankly, a different year, a different race, I said he’ll be someday he’s going to be the President of Mexico. So he remembered that and it turned out to be correct.”
Trump tweeted congratulations to the Mexican President-elect late Sunday:
Congratulations to Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on becoming the next President of Mexico. I look very much forward to working with him. There is much to be done that will benefit both the United States and Mexico!
The use of robots to commune with people with Alzheimer’s opens up a whole box of moral quandaries, not least the prospect of some cognitive threshold beneath which patients will be pushed into the arms of machines, rather than humans. It is worth remembering too that like the digital “assistants” now entering people’s homes, Pepper and the current robo-carers do not offer anything approaching the nuances and complexities of genuine human interchange, rather an app store version that most people would consider a matter of erratic entertainment rather than a day-do-day necessity. But as and when robots manage to convincingly perform as make-believe humans, what then? Paradoxically, key voices in the tech world have long believed that as automation sweeps through large swathes of the economy, with the right fiscal adjustments, it will increase the numbers of human caregivers, and elevate them above the low-paid parts of the labour market where such roles are currently concentrated. Last year, for example, a writer in Wired magazine said that such roles as “companions to the elderly, home health aides, babysitters, special-needs aides, and more” demanded to be taken more seriously, and that “the riches resulting from increased automation … could be used to help fund caregiving programs”.
"The president of the republic and his government will be absolutely respectful and support the authorities that are elected," Pena Nieto told reporters. Hovering over the election is the specter of vote fraud, though electoral officials deny it is a possibility with the modern balloting technology and institutions now in place. In both of Lopez Obrador's previous two presidential losses he alleged fraud. In his first loss — by a mere 0.56 percent to conservative Felipe Calderon in 2006 — his supporters held months-long protests in Mexico City and he referred to himself as "the legitimate president." His allies are warning even before Sunday's presidential vote that there better not be any funny business.

Extreme partisanship in Congress has led the legislature to relinquish its power to the presidency and the court, Edwards said. People say the founders would roll over in their graves – I think the founders would hang themselves Mickey Edwards, Aspen Institute
“We now have become so accustomed to thinking of things – whether it’s foreign policy or trade policy or other things that the Congress has constitutional authority over – we now look at them all as presidential powers,” Edwards said. “So the presidency has grown much stronger. “I would also say that the supreme court has grown stronger and it’s become more partisan, which is very disturbing.”
Not only has the court become more powerful, analysts say, but it also appears to have become increasingly insulated from the concerns of Main Street. While Trump’s short list of potential nominees to replace Kennedy is long on academic pedigrees, advocates question whether the next justice will have practical sympathies commensurate with the power he or she will have over average American lives.
Those factories are the core of an American operation that employs about 136,000 people, but they're also dependent on components sourced overseas for reasons of cost or availability. About 70 percent of the parts in a U.S.-built Camry, the country's best-selling car, come from domestic suppliers. Toyota on June 27 said that Trump's threatened 25 percent tariff on automotive imports would add $1,800 to the price of each sedan. The carmaker's warning of the dangers of tit-for-tat tariffs was just one of many. German lighting manufacturer Osram Licht's shares plunged 22 percent Thursday after it announced a weaker outlook due to trade tensions.
Four of the victims had life-threatening injuries, and the victims included people from Syria, Iraq and Ethiopia, Bones said. The attacker, who has an extensive criminal past, did not know the victims, he said. The Idaho Statesman newspaper said the apartment complex catered to low-income families and was run by a Boise nonprofit. Kinner was due to appear in court on Monday. Boise Mayor Dave Bieter said the “horrific attack” did not represent the state capital, which is the largest city in Idaho and has some 225,000 residents.
“If Trump goes ahead and institutes the first wave of tariffs, the Chinese are certainly quite prepared to strike back,” he said. “But Hollywood is not going to be in the frontline in the early period. … [Trump] is extremely unpopular in Hollywood.”
Hollywood and China have seen their relationship shift to a new model, analysts said, with major players such as Joe and Anthony Russo — the brother duo known for directing "Captain America" — setting up shop in China. The pair have backed production company Anthem & Song, based jointly in Los Angeles and Beijing, to produce Chinese-language films. Within China, the state-backed film industry has clear markings of Hollywood influence.
About four years ago, Dais had lined up a Chinese company to help develop its business in nanotechnology that helps produce clean water. Tangredi said the Chinese company persuaded a long-time Dais employee to defect with trade secrets. "They just stole it, and they are using it against us," he said. Tangredi said he hopes the threat of a trade war will force China to rethink its practices: "You've got to do something to get their attention."
The Republican Party is rotting away. The problem is that GOP policies just aren’t popular. Most Americans unsurprisingly oppose climate denial, tax cuts for the wealthy, and putting children (including toddlers) in concentration camps, for example. The Republican Party has thus far managed to continue winning elections by creating “a coalition between racists and plutocrats,” as Paul Krugman put it. The party’s economic policies are aimed at benefitting wealthy individuals and corporations, but that’s a slim segment of the American electorate.
We look at other parts of the world, where women are not allowed to vote, or dance, and we see ourselves as modern and liberated. But all our “freedoms” are fairly recent, from being able to get a mortgage to being protected from rape in marriage. The narrative of progress is one that too many liberals imbibe, but it is untrue. In many of the areas to which we turn when we measure gender equality, we have not moved forward for the past 10 years – income, political engagement, education.
Nebraska May Join Utah, Idaho in Putting Medicaid Expansion Before Voters

Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.
As motorists pay more to fill their tanks this Independence Day -- with gas prices at a four-year high for the holiday -- safety advocates are urging caution during celebrations that turn deadly on U.S. roadways. The national average for a gallon of gas on Tuesday stood at $2.86, making it the costliest for an Independence Day holiday in four years, according to AAA. That said, the nearly 40 million motorists expected to travel this week will pay 11 cents less per gallon at the pump than they did this past Memorial Day holiday, the motorist club noted. "The national gas price average has held fairly steady for the past 10 days, suggesting that U.S. demand is keeping pace with supply and stabilizing summer gas prices," a spokesperson for the motorist group said in a statement. "However, elevated crude oil prices and other geopolitical concerns could tilt gas prices more expensive in the early fall despite an expected increase in global crude production from OPEC and its partners."

Just hours after his historic election victory sent thousands of supporters pouring on to the streets, the 64-year-old leftist tweeted that he had received a call from Donald Trump. “I proposed that we explore an integral agreement of development projects, which generate jobs in Mexico and with that reduce migration and improve security. There was respectful treatment and our representatives will speak more.”
In an interview with the Televisa news network, López Obrador emphasized the need for mutual respect and cooperation between the two neighbors. “We are conscious of the need to maintain good relations with the United States. We have a border of more than 3,000 kilometers, more than 12 million Mexicans live in the United States.
Full-service restaurants with more elaborate menus and more complex processes, like the Red Hen and those in The Trump Organization properties, are more vulnerable to violations than fast-food eateries with limited food offerings and a streamlined kitchen production line, said Craig Hedberg, a professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Minnesota. And those with repeated violations can get into even more trouble with their local health departments, said Hedberg. Those eateries will be flagged by inspectors, who bring copies of previous reports on their visits and can spot patterns of regulation flouting. How repeat offenses are handled differs by jurisdiction. “It’s very rare to see a perfect score,” he said.
And-- they would leave the jail. And a couple days later they'd-- overdose and-- and die.”
Seeking a solution, Carl recruited Jason Merrick, a social worker and certified drug and alcohol counselor to run this new “therapeutic community.”
Though some are ordered by the court to enroll in the program, the vast majority of men sign themselves up, and the program is so successful that it has a running waitlist. Why not plug in a relatively low-cost social service program that would give someone a chance at life instead of just doing time and going back out and doing the same things over and over again. - Jason Merrick
Merrick told Fox News that about 83 percent of the men and women booked into the Kenton County Detention Center find themselves in jail “indirectly or directly related to their substance abuse.”
“Why not plug in a relatively low-cost social service program that would give someone a chance at life instead of just doing time and going back out and doing the same things over and over again,” Merrick lamented. That rehab program, called Unit 104, houses 70 men just like Hall.

Durbin’s advocacy for mass-migration and for younger ‘dreamer’ illegals has caused the Democrats much political pain. He pushed for the abortive budget-shutdown in January 2018, and for the “Gang of Eight” amnesty bill in 2013 which helped the Democrats lose nine seats in 2014. The Democrats’ top leader in the Senate, Sen. Chuck Schumer, is keeping his distance from the “Abolish ICE” campaign. He is instead using his Twitter account to tout Democrats’ promises on healthcare, guns, gay status, and claims that President Donald Trump is tied to Russian President Vladimir Putin. On the Abolish ICE campaign, Schumer is instead calling for a “czar” to focus media attention on “reunifying families.” That topic polls better for Democrats than ending immigration enforcement.
"The president of the republic and his government will be absolutely respectful and support the authorities that are elected," Pena Nieto told reporters. Hovering over the election is the specter of vote fraud, though electoral officials deny it is a possibility with the modern balloting technology and institutions now in place. In both of Lopez Obrador's previous two presidential losses he alleged fraud. In his first loss — by a mere 0.56 percent to conservative Felipe Calderon in 2006 — his supporters held months-long protests in Mexico City and he referred to himself as "the legitimate president."

Hamilton, the Republican state lawmaker who beat the incumbent Karnes, won with a mix of support from teachers and other unions. While Karnes sparred with teachers during the strike, Hamilton took a moderate position. He aligned with teachers unions by opposing state right-to-work legislation and the proposed repeal of prevailing wage laws for public construction projects. The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.
The major U.S. stock indexes were mostly higher in early trading Friday following a solid jobs report, keeping the market on track for a weekly gain after two weeks of losses. The modest gains came despite an escalation in global trade tensions as the U.S. imposed tariffs on billions in Chinese goods and China responded in kind. Health care stocks posted the biggest gains, led by Biogen. The drugmaker's stock soared 18 percent to $353.28 on encouraging results from an Alzheimer's therapy. Industrials companies took some of the biggest losses.

In its statement, Delancey said it remained committed to ensuring the continued maintenance of the centre but added that it was over 50 years old, “and as is often the way with older buildings, some elements do unfortunately fail”. The delay in repairing the escalator was because it was so old, spare parts were no longer made and had to be specially manufactured, the spokeswoman said. The shopping centre has long attracted scorn and been dismissed as an eyesore – not least because of its “manky, hot-pink” exterior, as Time Out once put it – but some see that as part of its charm, with the Guardian’s property section once describing it approvingly as the “anti-Westfield”.

In the trench war between congressional Republicans and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, we have arrived at a crucial battle. A House resolution sets Friday as the deadline for the Justice Department to come clean on the beginning of its investigation into the Trump campaign. We’ll find out if the FBI has been lying to the public. That is, if the department complies. It has flouted so many subpoenas, and played so many games with redactions and deadlines, that the entire House GOP united last week to vote for the resolution demanding submission to Congress’s requests for documents.
On this much police and activist South Side priest Michael Pfleger can agree: Saturday morning’s anti-violence march on the Dan Ryan Expressway is all about danger. Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.

Delivering a speech in Newcastle on Thursday, he said: “At the moment, protectionism is largely just talk (and tweets). But what if rhetoric becomes reality?”
Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.
“[Bannon] can help us with his experience, with his knowledge—advising us on how to campaign and make our message reach more people.”
Ortega expects the Darth Vader of international politics to visit Spain “soon.” Bannon was meant to meet with Vox in May, but Bannon is busier than ever, Ortega says, after going back to being an adviser to Trump. The Vox general secretary seems to have gotten his wires crossed on that count, unless there’s something Trump and Bannon aren’t telling us. Steve Bannon’s press office declined multiple requests for comment. “There’s never been a party like Vox. Since the birth of the Spanish Constitution a party that defends what Vox defends has never existed,” Ortega says.
The new law - approved by 87 votes to 15 in the 120-seat Knesset late on Monday - requires the Israeli government to withhold an amount of tax revenue equal to what is paid by the PA to "individuals who were involved in terror activity against Israelis and their families". If the defence ministry determines that such payments are no longer being made, the frozen funds will be returned to the PA.
Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman hailed the legislation, saying: "An effective war on terrorism also passes through the pocket - of the terrorists, of their families and of [Palestinian Authority President] Mahmoud Abbas." Image copyright AFP Image caption The law's sponsors said the PA's payments were "an expression of support for acts of terror"
But chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat condemned what he called a "very dangerous decision that amounts to the cancellation of the Palestinian Authority and is piracy and theft". The PA's Minister of Prisoner Affairs, Issa Qaraqeh, meanwhile insisted the payments would continue. "When we signed Oslo Agreement, it was clear to Israel that the Palestinian Authority pays these families, and they never objected," he was quoted as saying by the Associated Press.

President Trump’s reshaping of the GOP from being aligned to the Chamber of Commerce to a party serving the interests of America’s working and middle class is winning over young white American men en masse. Ahead of Trump’s election to the presidency in 2016, nearly 50 percent of young white men favored Democrats, and 36 percent favored the GOP. That 14-point gain has flipped, and young white men now favor the GOP over the Democrats by 46 percent to 37 percent. At the time, the GOP was aligned with the big business lobby and Wall Street in promoting endless multinational free trade that readily outsourced American jobs to foreign countries. The Republican establishment, in 2016, was pushing the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which would have eliminated millions of working and middle-class jobs while also driving down wages for remaining American workers.
It's difficult to imagine Old Hickory, as he was known, excusing himself from military duty on the grounds that he could not march long distances, as Mr Trump did during the Vietnam War, citing bone spurs. The parallels between the 45th president and the 13th - unlucky for some - are arguably more compelling. Fillmore launched his career in the 1820s with the Anti-Masonic Party, hawking a paranoid rumour that ruling Freemasons were murdering whistleblowers. Mr Trump paved the way for his White House bid by peddling a conspiracy theory, too - that President Barack Obama was not a US citizen.

Fillmore later joined the Whig Party at a time of mounting hostility to refugees from famine, rebellion and tyranny who were arriving by the shipload at the gates of the New World.
In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners. Alas, he is wasting his time trying to shift the views of the Democratic Party, which has become ever more left-wing, if not outright socialist. I think it is time for Mr. James to become a Republican. Guy Randolph

It’s shocking that Mr. James is surprised by the positive economic results of less regulation and lower taxes.

"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.

Analysts say tariffs are not the most effective way of putting pressure on China, which the US accuses of unfair trade practices and stealing intellectual property from US companies. Syracuse University economics professor Mary Lovely and researcher Yang Liang found 87% of electronics products to be levied by US tariffs came from multinationals and joint ventures rather than Chinese firms. China’s economy is no longer as dependent on exports. Domestic consumption now accounts for more than half of the country’s GDP. Exports to the US account for only 19% of all of China’s exports.

They include the United States withdrawing its 28,500 troops in South Korea, ending its military drills with South Korea and stop bringing in strategic assets such as aircraft carriers and nuclear-capable bombers. North Korea hasn't repeated such specific demands since entering disarmament talks earlier this year, raising optimism that the country truly appeared to seek to improve ties with the United States. After the summit, Trump suspended annual military training with South Korea that the North has called an invasion rehearsal. But North Korea still prefers a step-by-step disarmament process with reciprocal concessions and benefits from the United States for each of the North's denuclearization steps. The ultimate rewards North Korea wants range from the easing or lifting of American-led international sanctions, the signing of a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, the establishment of diplomatic ties and the pulling out of U.S. troops in South Korea, experts say.
The federal government provides about 80 percent of the state's Medicaid funds. The cuts to dental and vision benefits were supposed to affect only able-bodied adults, mostly those added to Medicaid under an expansion authorized through the Affordable Care Act. Advocates say the cutoff of vision and dental benefits is unnecessary and possibly illegal. Bevin's administration announced the cuts after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Friday rejected Bevin's sweeping plan to overhaul the state's Medicaid program. The plan would have eliminated dental and vision benefits for such individuals, although they could earn points toward purchasing such services with a "My Rewards" account through activities such as volunteering or taking online classes.
Crimes such as robbery remain rampant across Venezuela amid the country’s dire economic and humanitarian crisis, leading growing numbers of people to turn to violence merely to ensure survival. Kidnappings, armed robberies, and violent attacks are now commonplace. Venezuela is widely considered one of the most dangerous destinations in the world. As noted by El Nacional, “There are many travelers who have been stripped of money, luggage, and vehicles on the Caracas-La Guaira highway, especially at night and early morning when the road is little traveled and lacks surveillance.”
The doctors were present in Venezuela as part of an agreement between the two countries. Venezuela typically pays for the doctors in vast quantities of oil, an initiative that started under Hugo Chávez and Fidel Castro.

XI ASSERTS TERRITORIAL CLAIMS IN MEETING WITH US DEFENSE SECRETARY
Chinese President Xi Jinping strongly asserted China's determination to defend territory it claims, including in the South China Sea, in a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. While the tone of Mattis' visit to Beijing was largely upbeat, Xi made sure to reinforce his reputation as a fervent nationalist when it comes to issues of sovereignty. Though Xi gave no specifics in his statement, he was largely seen as indicating the South China Sea as well as self-governing Taiwan. China also claims territory held by India and uninhabited East China Sea islands controlled by Japan.

Eric Young, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees’ Council of Prison Locals, now prays before he looks at his phone every morning, worried he’ll receive a message from BOP’s director notifying him of a staff death. Young estimates that around two-thirds of his union members were Trump supporters. That makes sense: It’s a law enforcement agency that leans white and male (72 percent male, 62 percent white), and many federal prisons are in rural parts of the country, which Trump dominated. But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau. BOP has long suffered the kind of problems you’d expect for a massive bureaucracy centered on caging tens of thousands of people.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
"We have made tremendous progress and the future of the EPA is very bright!" In his resignation letter to Trump, Pruitt said: "It is extremely difficult for me to cease serving you in this role first because I count it a blessing to be serving you in any capacity, but also, because of the transformative work that is occurring. "However, the unrelenting attacks on me personally [and] my family, are unprecedented and have taken a sizable toll on all of us," Pruitt added. Pruitt resigned less than a week after The New York Times reported that the EPA's chief ethics official, Kevin Minoli, had been pushing for a series of independent investigation into several aspects of Pruitt's tenure. Those include Pruitt's rental of a Washington D.C. condominium for $50 per day from the spouse of a prominent fossil fuel lobbyist and his alleged use of staff to handle personal matters.
Lopez Obrador has promised a "transformation" of Mexico and pledged to give scholarships or paid apprenticeships to youth, and increase support payments for the elderly. But rivals warn that a Lopez Obrador could set the country back decades with an interventionist economic policy. All the candidates are lambasting President Donald Trump's policies against migrants and Mexico, but voters were wondering who could best deal with Trump. Sunday's elections for posts at every level of government are Mexico's largest ever and have become a referendum on corruption, graft and other tricks used to divert taxpayer money to officials' pockets and empty those of the country's poor. This is Lopez Obrador's third bid for the presidency and some see it as his best shot after 12 years of near-permanent campaigning.
The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks picked up 1.1 percent to 1,679.48. Benchmark U.S. crude added 9 cents to $73.03 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract plunged $1.20, or 1.6 percent, to settle at $72.94 per barrel Thursday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 14 cents to $77.25 per barrel in London. It slid 85 cents, or 1.1 percent, to close at $77.39 per barrel on Thursday.
These numbers are similar to those from a February Quinnipiac poll, where 49 percent of voters said Trump was racist and 46 percent said he was not. Forty-four percent of voters said they think “racist beliefs” were a motive in Trump’s immigration policy, while 50 percent said Trump has “a sincere interest in controlling our borders.” Sixty percent said the policy of separating children from their parents at the border was a violation of human rights. Since enacting the policy, Trump and his associates have repeatedly pushed false, racist narratives to garner support, often associating immigration with high crime rates despite no evidence to support claims that immigrants commit more crime than U.S. citizens. While only 11 percent of Republican voters in the Quinnipiac poll said they think Trump is a racist, 22 percent said they believe Trump has emboldened racist people to express their beliefs publicly. The number of hate crimes rose the year Trump was elected ― the first increase in over a decade.
While most of these foreign doctors are perfectly capable, a disproportionate number turn out to be incompetent, with more than half of doctors subject to ‘fitness to practice’ investigation by the General Medical Council (GMC) being non-British. Critics suggest that plundering the Third World of clinicians rather than training British talent will disincentivise poor countries from investing in medical training, as the investment is a waste of limited resources if doctors simply leave for Western countries once qualified. However, new Home Secretary Sajid Javid does not appear to be changing course and is actually relaxing immigration controls to recruit more foreign medical personnel. At the same time, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is making it harder to remove doctors who kill their patients from the medical register at the same time, leading to concerns that the Government is facilitating a massive fall in standards.

ZTE is far from alone. China assembles some 90 percent of the world's smartphones, computers and other electronics. But most of the revenue flows to American companies that supply computer chips and other technology. In the broader economy, Chinese banks, airlines, farms and other industries need U.S. technology from jetliners to drugs to software. What Washington welcomes as a source of well-paid jobs, Chinese leaders consider a dangerous dependence.
“They’ve twisted American values,” she said in a follow-up phone interview. “A lot of them are anti-God, anti-religion and anti-military.”
In the survey, most say they are proud to be Americans, although Republicans feel that way more strongly (90 percent) than Democrats (61 percent). There is no consensus when asked about the country’s current course, though: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. “Overwhelming majorities of those in both parties and independents agree that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.”” USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll

There obviously must be judicial oversight of any more separations as required by law. We suggest two additional solutions: blocking deportations and a combination of personal tort suits and state criminal charges for officials who take part in “indiscriminately” separating families after Judge Sabraw’s categorical ruling against it. As we previously argued in Slate, the administration’s family separations were plainly unconstitutional. The district court agreed, at least for the purposes of a preliminary injunction.
Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon declined to comment. The village is located in the 60 percent of the West Bank known as Area C, which remains under exclusive Israeli control and is home to dozens of Israeli settlements. Israel places severe restrictions on Palestinian development in Area C, and home demolitions there are not unusual. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. As part of interim peace deals in the 1990s, the West Bank was carved up into autonomous and semi-autonomous Palestinian areas, known as Areas A and B, and Area C, which is home to some 400,000 Israeli settlers.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
If that happens there would be plenty of credit to go around. Certainly President Moon would deserve great credit for his unprecedented initiative in engaging the North. Certainly Kim Jong Un would deserve great credit for seeing that he could achieve his country’s security without nuclear weapons. And certainly Trump would deserve great credit for seeing the possibility of a peaceful solution where many of his advisers saw military action as the only option. In the meantime, we have much hard work ahead.
Appearing in a state he dominated in 2016, Trump cast Tester as a "liberal Democrat," railing against his voting record on issues like abortion, immigration and taxes. While Tester opposed Trump's first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, and the Republican tax bill, he also took flak from the left for a bill easing the rules on banks. Tester tried to counter Trump's visit by taking out a full-page ad Thursday in more than a dozen newspapers across the state thanking him for signing 16 bills the Democrat sponsored or co-sponsored. Trump rallied in Great Falls to boost the candidacy of Tester's Republican challenger, state Auditor Matt Rosendale, who is seeking to deny Tester a third term and give Montana an all-Republican congressional delegation. The president has made the Montana race a priority as he hopes to help Republicans tighten the party's hold on the Senate.

As for “compassion,” what compassion are you showing for someone who, for all you know, may struggle with certain elements of her job herself? What compassion are you showing in a country where the Supreme Court just ruled on gay customers being denied services in a cake shop, yet your gay staff members want you to refuse service to someone they don’t like? Nor is this about “cooperation.” It’s the opposite of cooperation. It’s about your feelings trumping everything else, include decorum, manners or common decency.
Michigan lawmakers axed a requirement that would make prospective teachers take a basic skills test before earning their certification in Michigan. Rick Snyder signed legislation last week to get rid of the law requiring all prospective teachers to take the SAT to become certified in the state of Michigan, the Detroit Free Press reported. “The basic skills test … is not a strong indicator of how successful a teacher will be,” said Sen. Marty Knollenberg (R-Troy), one of the sponsors of the bipartisan-supported legislation. Knollenberg, who serves as the state Senate Education Committee chair, said the panel made its decision to make it easier for people to become teachers.
The list of Democrats expressing frustration with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has been growing longer in recent weeks, but don’t expect to see former President Barack Obama’s name on it. At a party fundraising event Friday afternoon in Northern California, Obama spoke highly of Pelosi – and even predicted that she will return to the job of House speaker after November’s midterm elections. “I think everybody knows how much I love Nancy Pelosi,” Obama told the gathering at a home in affluent Atherton, Politico reported. "Nancy, I believe, is one of the greatest speakers we ever had, and will once again be one of the greatest speakers we ever have after we get through this cycle," he continued. “And there's not much I could have gotten done without having Nancy there alongside of me every step of the way.”

The federal government provides about 80 percent of the state's Medicaid funds. The cuts to dental and vision benefits were supposed to affect only able-bodied adults, mostly those added to Medicaid under an expansion authorized through the Affordable Care Act. Advocates say the cutoff of vision and dental benefits is unnecessary and possibly illegal. Bevin's administration announced the cuts after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Friday rejected Bevin's sweeping plan to overhaul the state's Medicaid program. The plan would have eliminated dental and vision benefits for such individuals, although they could earn points toward purchasing such services with a "My Rewards" account through activities such as volunteering or taking online classes.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Police officer Jon Owen recalls how a road traffic incident affected his mental health. The number of police officers in Avon and Somerset taking time off for mental health reasons has risen by 450% in less than a decade, the BBC has found. Nearly 15,000 days were lost in 2017-18, compared to about 2,700 in 2009-10, mostly due to stress and depression. Jon Owen from the Police Federation said being a officer was now "highly likely to hurt you". The force's deputy chief constable blamed staff cutbacks and "more complex" challenges for the increase.
Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.
The illegal immigrants were accompanied by their “trail guide” who allegedly helped them march around the Falfurrias Border Patrol Checkpoint located about 80 miles from the Texas/Mexico border. Agents said another person in the vehicle is another illegal immigrant who joined the group during their march through the brush in Brooks County. Cartel connected human smugglers frequently force their human cargo to march through the very dangerous terrain in Brooks County. More than twenty percent of the deaths of illegal immigrants along the U.S. southwest border with Mexico occur in Brooks County, 80 miles from the border. Agents arrested the couple who were in the U.S. to allegedly seek asylum.

It introduced tariff changes in 2017 which are the subject of a legal challenge by boiler owners. Image caption The RHI inquiry was set up to investigate the circumstances surrounding the scheme after its costs spiralled
The cost-cutting measures included the introduction of a much less generous tiered-tariff and a cap on the number of hours eligible for subsidy. The cap was fixed at 400,000kwh - equivalent to a 99kw boiler running 11 hours a day, 365 days a year. Prior to the cap, 659 RHI boilers ran for longer than this. Since its introduction, that number has fallen to 118.
Public support for abortion rights “remains as high as it has been in two decades of polling”, according to Pew Research, with 57% “saying abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 40% say it should be illegal in all or most cases”. “It’s clear that Donald Trump seeks to put forward a narrow-minded elitist who will protect corporations, the wealthy and the powerful, and individuals who will dismantle Roe, take away critical rights of LGBT Americans and eliminate healthcare for millions of people,” said Goldberg, referring to Roe v Wade, the 1973 decision protecting abortion rights. “All of these rights have been hard-won over decades, and it’s no exaggeration to say the right wants to put on the bench an individual that will turn the clock back.”

In rulings on issues such as workplace arbitration, sexual harassment, voting rights, consumer rights and civil rights, the court could have a particuilar impact on society’s most vulnerable. “I think the reality is that the court’s influence on everyday lives is felt most directly by those who tend to depend upon government, those who may not be in a socio-economic position to adequately vindicate their own rights without some government assistance,” said Vladeck.

WASHINGTON – If it's a holiday, it must be time for President Donald Trump to hit the golf course. Right on schedule, the presidential motorcade arrived at the Trump National Golf Club in suburban Virginia in the late morning, the middle of a day that also has the president tweeting and hosting a military-themed picnic later at the White House. As he departed the presidential mansion in the morning, Trump took to Twitter. In addition to a general salutation – "Happy Fourth of July....Our Country is doing GREAT!"
"Jon's record is clear—if it's good for Montana, Jon works with anyone from either party to get things done. If it's bad for Montana, he'll stand up to anyone," Tester spokesman Chris Meagher said. "East Coast developer Matt Rosendale is only looking out for himself and whatever out-of-state special interest group that is propping up his campaign with cash. We can't trust him to defend Montana." But before Trump arrived in Montana, Tester's campaign took out full-page ads in newspapers across the state, highlighting bills the senator sponsored that Trump has signed into law.
He aligned himself with most of his Democratic colleagues against Gina Haspel, Trump's pick for CIA director, arguing that her record on enhanced interrogation techniques was unacceptable. And instead of focusing on a politically safe issue in his maiden Senate floor speech, Jones struck a nerve by calling for a dialogue on gun violence after the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida. In addition, during the campaign, Jones made no secret of his desire to protect LGBTQ rights and to support a woman's right to abortion. It's those kinds of positions that have made him a darling of Alabama's progressive minority — and somewhat of a public enemy among the state's conservative majority. Jones has introduced four pieces of legislation — none of any huge significance — since he arrived on Capitol Hill, including two agriculture bills, one that would expand access to capital for rural job creators and the last seeking to mandate an annual Medicaid expansion review.
Calls for an Iran without its current “dictatorial regime” were met with strengthened hope during the annual “free Iran” rally held in Paris this past weekend by the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), an exiled Paris-based Iranian opposition group allied with the Mujaheddin-e-Khalq (MEK). The rally, which event organizers said saw more than 100,000 attendees, took place at the Villepinte Congress Center, outside of Paris on Saturday. A series of panel discussions ranging in topic from women’s rights to denuclearization took place on Friday. The Guardian reported there was “a crowd of about 4,000, many of them refugees and young eastern Europeans who had been bussed in to attend the rally in return for a weekend trip to Paris.”
Distinguished speakers at Saturday’s event included former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal attorney; New Mexico’s former Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson; former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich; former Sen. Robert Torricelli (D-NJ); former FBI Director Louis Freeh; former Homeland Security Adviser Frances Townsend; and former U.S. Army chief of staff Gen. George Casey.
Tweeting Saturday from New Jersey, Trump urged ICE agents to "not worry or lose your spirit" and wrote that "the radical left Dems want you out. Next it will be all police." A number of prominent Democrats have called for the outright elimination of ICE. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York said ICE has "become a deportation force," telling CNN late Thursday "you should get rid of it, start over, reimagine it and build something that actually works." Rep. Mark Pocan, a Democrat from Wisconsin, stated last week that he plans to introduce legislation to eliminate ICE.
“Sea levels have hardly risen and temperatures are still below those of the medieval warm period. Over time, temperature change seems to correlate rather more with sun spot activity than with carbon dioxide levels. “And even if carbon dioxide, a naturally occurring trace gas that’s necessary for life, really is the main climate change villain, Australia’s contribution to mankind’s emissions is scarcely more than 1%.”
Abbott framed his contribution not as a deliberate wrecking exercise but as an effort to “save” the government. “Far from wrecking the government, MPs worried about energy policy are trying to save it, with a policy that would be different from Labor’s and would give voters the affordable and reliable power they want.”
"This document that has been so controversial and in many places reviled," Eberstadt says, "actually called the shots on what the future would look like better than any other single source I could think of." Revisionist views of the 1968 encyclical have even taken hold among some Catholics who have not abided by its teaching. "I eventually did read Humanae Vitae," says Jerry DeMers, "and actually I get the [pope's] point, the prediction he makes that if we practice contraception as a society, we will have a breakdown of the family. Because we have separated sex from marriage." U.S. Catholics however, show in their daily lives that the church's official prohibition of artificial birth control means little in practice, even if it has some value in theory.
That has not been true of all past presidents. Andrew Jackson famously dismissed a court decision against his forced removal of the Cherokees from Georgia by saying: “The chief justice has made his ruling. Now let him enforce it.” As for today’s controversial immigration policies separating children from parents, they are, sadly, legal - a reminder that something may be immoral but not also illegal, and also a reminder that laws must be continually revised to reflect our highest societal moral standards. The Trump administration has also become adept at finding obscure, long dormant “national security” clauses in the federal codex to invoke as justification for steel and aluminum tariffs as well as punitive tariffs on Chinese goods (the latter has been announced but not yet enacted). These may be stupid policy, but they are not illegal - yet.
Even those who were fully clothed – many looking flamboyant – seemed to be in urgent need of help, aching to achieve a certain dream.

A few days before the trip, I had spoken to a group of young students enrolled in a mentorship programme at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

Freshman Rep. Moira Jayne Walsh, 27, who has been outspoken about what she sees as a culture of corruption in the State House, lost her party's endorsement to Michael Earnheart, who voted for President Donald Trump. As a safe blue state, Rhode Island rarely gets any national political attention. But Walsh woke up Tuesday to donations from as far away as Texas and California. Party officials describe Earnheart as a "lifelong Democrat" who voted for Trump because he didn’t like Hillary Clinton.
Bishop John Bauerschmidt, who oversees the Middle Tennessee region of the church, stands firmly by his decision not to authorize their use, nor allow clergy within his diocese to officiate the religious ceremonies or permit the weddings on church property. In doing so, the bishop says he is being faithful to his job of guarding the discipline, faith and unity of the church.

"The teaching that Christian marriage is between a man and a woman is reasonable, traditional, and scriptural," Bauerschmidt said in an email. "There really is nothing remarkable about a Christian bishop who holds to this teaching." While Bishops can place limitations on the use of the marriage liturgies, they must refer couples to a willing diocese if they do not authorize them.
The economy has added an average 207,000 jobs a month this year after a blowout number of 223,000 in May. Economists predict that 195,000 jobs were added in June. Unemployment stands at 3.8%, the lowest rate since 2000. If it dips to 3.7%, it will be the lowest since 1969.
We look at other parts of the world, where women are not allowed to vote, or dance, and we see ourselves as modern and liberated. But all our “freedoms” are fairly recent, from being able to get a mortgage to being protected from rape in marriage. The narrative of progress is one that too many liberals imbibe, but it is untrue. In many of the areas to which we turn when we measure gender equality, we have not moved forward for the past 10 years – income, political engagement, education.

Such challenges are a shot across the bow at the administration and DeVos, who is working to redefine a department conceived to advocate for students — not schools or lobbyists seeking financial profits. The debate carries huge significance for U.S. taxpayers, who fund the billions of dollars in student loans and grants DeVos oversees each year. “With Navient bulldozing students on their loans and the Department of Education gone missing in action, California is moving to stop the abuse,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra told NBC News in a statement. The California suit argues that Navient improperly steered financially distressed borrowers — such as single moms and new graduates — into forbearance, costing them thousands of dollars. It specifically targets federal loans that DeVos and Mick Mulvaney, acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, are tasked with policing.
According to a Russian state media report related by Turkey’s Hurriyet Daily News , the United States is planning to send next-generation B61 nuclear gravity bombs to NATO bases in several European countries, including Turkey. The bomb is said to be compatible with F-35 joint strike fighters, which Turkey is also due to receive amid some controversy. Hurriyet describes the B61 nuclear bomb and Russia’s sour reaction to the prospect of NATO bases receiving them:
The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) and the U.S. Air Force completed two non-nuclear system qualification flight tests of the B61-12 gravity bomb on June 9 at Tonopah Test Range in Nevada, according to a June 29 statement by DOE/NNSA. The test, which was reportedly the first of its kind, was aimed at extending the B61 bomb’s service life by adapting it to next generation aircraft, including B-2A Spirit Bomber. “The B61-12 LEP will consolidate and replace the existing B61 bomb variants in the [U.S.] nuclear stockpile.
In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners.

Most were in their twenties, and some were couples, but otherwise, they fit no single profile. Only a little information about their fate has trickled out from the secretive North Korean regime. The full explanation of why they were taken remains a mystery. The unexplained state-sponsored crime has shaped Japanese politics, with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe using the abductions to capitalize on anti-North Korean sentiment and advance his political career. Today, Megumi’s image is plastered on posters as the face of the issue, and her story has become a potent source of nationalism, frequently told in government-produced anime films and comic books.

The University of Missouri is still facing enrollment and budgetary problems, including a $49 million budget shortfall, as a result of the 2015 social justice protests that caught national media attention. Many people remember the high-pitched yell of former University of Missouri professor Melissa Click. Click found herself at the center of weeks of unrest at the University of Missouri in 2015 and 2016. Click rose to infamy after a video of her calling for a student photojournalist to be physically removed from campus simply because he was documenting the protests. The protests involved accusations by students that the administration had mishandled several alleged racial issues on campus.

No written authorisation was given for warrant officer’s ride in armed vehicle at Castlemartin range in Wales
Two soldiers were killed in an explosion in a tank on a British firing range after a warrant officer was given a “guest experience” ride in the armed vehicle, an inquest was told. No written authorisation had been given for the guest experience, a vital piece of equipment was not in place in the tank and charges were apparently not stowed correctly away, the inquest was told. Cpls Matthew Hatfield and Darren Neilson of the Royal Tank Regiment (RTR) died in the incident at Castlemartin range in Pembrokeshire in June last year. Their inquest was told that witnesses heard a hiss and saw smoke and flames coming from the turret of the Challenger 2 tank. Neilson, the tank commander, was seen climbing out from the turret and was thrown some distance by the force of the explosion.
Kinner was being held without bail at the Ada County jail on 15 charges, including six of injury to a child and nine of aggravated battery, jail records showed. There was no lawyer listed for Kinner in the records. Kinner may have wanted to “extract vengeance” for being kicked out by a tenant who took him in, Police Chief Bill Bones said at a press conference on Sunday. The woman who took Kinner in was not harmed and was not at the residence at the time of the attack. Kinner assaulted the children at the party after he was unable to find the woman, police said, adding his motive was still under investigation.

Federal prosecutors on Tuesday publicly debunked conspiracy theories pushed by President Donald Trump and right-wing media that a former Democratic aide charged with bank fraud was actually a foreign spy trying to steal government secrets. In a plea deal with Imran Awan, who worked as an information technology aide for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., and other Democratic lawmakers, prosecutors said they had conducted "a thorough investigation" into claims that Awan stole information from government servers on behalf of another country while working for House Democrats, but reported that they found no evidence to support the conspiracy theories. "The Government agrees that the public allegations that (Awan) stole U.S. House of Representatives equipment and engaged in unauthorized or illegal conduct involving House computer systems do not form the basis of any conduct relevant to the determination of the sentence in this case," prosecutors said.In a plea deal with Imran Awan, who worked as an information technology aide for Rep.

The program, also known as a white hat operation, was part of a broader plan to get the company to treat disinformation campaigns by governments differently than it did more traditional problems such as spam, which is aimed at tricking individual users as opposed to shaping the political climate in an entire country, according to these people.

That came on the heels of 0.9 percent drop in March, the first monthly drop since July of 2017. Total private construction rose 0.3 percent, with residential projects up 0.8 percent in May. New single-family home construction rose 0.6 percent and the volatile apartment building sector jumped 1.6 percent. Private, non-residential building fell 0.3 percent. Economists are forecasting that construction spending will contribute to overall growth this year even though interest rates are rising.
Nonfarm payrolls surged by 223,000 jobs during that month as warm weather bolstered hiring at construction sites. June’s data is expected to show a 200,000 increase, according to a Reuters poll. The closely-watched hourly wages in May rose 0.3 percent, topping economists’ estimates. The same figure is expected in June.

But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said. Tackett said he's concerned about children, especially in Eastern Kentucky, which has a higher rate of Medicaid patients and some of the state's worst oral health. "I have no problem with them regulating the adults that are on Medicaid," Tackett said. "If they are young and healthy, they should be out working or doing something.

Gun violence in Canada's largest city appears to be taking place at a higher rate than normal. So far this year, 29 people have been killed in 208 separate shootings. Gun deaths are up 50% from the same time as last year, according to police statistics. The two men killed on Saturday were identified as Jahvante Smart, 21, and Ernest Modekwe, 28, both of whom were from Toronto. Earlier on Saturday, a teenage boy was injured by gunfire around 4:30pm north of the city's downtown area.
Emergency officials found a man and a woman — both aged in their 40s — unconscious at a property in Amesbury, England, on Saturday. “It was initially believed that the two patients fell ill after using possibly heroin or crack cocaine from a contaminated batch of drugs,” Wiltshire Police said in a statement. “However, further testing is now ongoing to establish the substance which led to these patients becoming ill and we are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances surrounding this incident.”
Public Health England's @PHE_uk advice is currently: "Based upon the number of casualties affected, is that it is not believed that there is a significant health risk to the wider public. This will be continually assessed as further information becomes known." — Wiltshire Police (@wiltshirepolice) July 4, 2018

Freshman Rep. Moira Jayne Walsh, 27, who has been outspoken about what she sees as a culture of corruption in the State House, lost her party's endorsement to Michael Earnheart, who voted for President Donald Trump. As a safe blue state, Rhode Island rarely gets any national political attention. But Walsh woke up Tuesday to donations from as far away as Texas and California. Party officials describe Earnheart as a "lifelong Democrat" who voted for Trump because he didn’t like Hillary Clinton.
"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.

Agents in the field contacted the Tucson Sector’s Tactical Operation Center and reported that a K-9 agent became overheated.

As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.

Small businesses hired workers at a slower pace in June, the second straight month of weakening job gains despite an overall healthy economy. Payroll company ADP said Thursday it counted 29,000 new jobs at its customers with 49 or fewer employees. This marks a decline from small business job gains of 46,000 in May and 50,000 in April. So far this year, small businesses have been creating on average 46,000 jobs a month. ADP reported that overall private employers added 177,00 jobs last month, a slight drop-off from the average this year of 202,667 a month as companies say they're having a tougher time finding skilled workers.
President Trump has just said in the past week he's going to raise things like Syria, like Ukraine, like the election meddling issue, really the whole range of issues between us. And I think that, in the president's mind, this is very important, because it gives him an opportunity to size up Vladimir Putin, to see where there are areas where we might make progress together and where there are areas where we may not. BRENNAN: Well, right now, Russia is blanket-bombing Southern Syria. That violates the last agreement Vladimir Putin made with President Trump. Why would he believe that he's in any way trustworthy?

Meanwhile, other media personalities have faced kidnappings, arrests and physical abuse by mysterious hooded men who no journalist dare name - but every journalist in the country is convinced belong to the military intelligence agencies. But after maintaining months of silence as to what it has endured, or what exactly the military's complaints are, Dawn recently published a frank and stinging editorial. The editorial describes its important, factual reporting about the serious rift between civil and military authorities during the Nawaz Sharif government, which had infuriated the military, and Dawn's insistence on protecting the sources for its stories - a basic element of media ethics worldwide. The editorial states that "a campaign of disinformation, libel and slander, hate and virtual incitement to violence against Dawn and its staff has necessitated placing certain matters on record". It added that elements "within or sections of the state" are not upholding constitutional freedoms.

Practice is only one of Deborah Glass’s 125 recommendations not accepted by Victorian government
Female prisoners in Victoria are still subject to “abusive” routine strip searches, a state government watchdog says. The Victorian ombudsman, Deborah Glass, said the government has failed to adopt a recommendation from her 2015 report into the prison system that called for an end to the searches. “Why has the government not accepted my recommendation to stop the abusive practice of routinely strip-searching women prisoners – in fact, the only recommendation out of 125 not accepted?” she asked on Wednesday. The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year.
We don't think carefully and respectfully about each other's needs. We struggle to communicate, and sometimes fail. So if we're trying to communicate with someone and we don't even know who that someone is, I think it's reasonable to expect to be profoundly misunderstood. Honestly, the only thing I would say is "One, three, five, seven, eleven, thirteen" [listing prime numbers]. I would like to send a message that indicates that we're here.
The proposal would:
Legalize the possession and sale of up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana for personal, recreational use for people over the age of 21. A person could keep up to 10 ounces of marijuana at home. Tax marijuana sales with a 10 percent excise tax at the retail level as well as the state's 6 percent sales tax. Split those revenues, with 35 percent going to K-12 education, 35 percent to roads, 15 percent to the communities that allow marijuana businesses in their communities and 15 percent to counties where marijuana business are located. Allow communities to decide whether they’ll allow marijuana businesses in their towns.

Trump suggested that Mexico can help the United States “until we straighten out our immigration laws, which have been bad for many, many years, decades.” He further assured, “We’re gonna have them taken care of.”

Corporate America couldn’t hire Republican lobbyists fast enough after President Donald Trump’s election gave the GOP unified control of Washington. Now there are signs that Democrats are back in demand. Companies and trade groups are trying to hire congressional staffers with ties to influential House Democrats four months ahead of the midterm elections, in which Democrats are expected to pick up seats and potentially retake control of the House. Lobbyists are helping their clients meet with the Democrats who would become committee chairs if the party does win back the chamber. And trade groups are talking to members about what to expect from a Democratic takeover.

U.S. Government lawyers are slamming one of President Donald Trump's most prominent critics, attorney Michael Avenatti, over nearly half a million dollars in unpaid federal taxes owed by his former firm. Avenatti's former law firm, Eagan Avenatti LLP, agreed to make the roughly $452,000 tax payment last month in order to resolve a bankruptcy case, but the funds never arrived at the IRS, according to a filing Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, Calif.

Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) trashed the June jobs report — even though it showed rapid job growth, rising wages, and low unemployment. The report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that employers created 213,000 new jobs in June — 22,000 more than economists had expected. Manufacturing jobs in particular rose by 36,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.
Allow for three categories of marijuana grow operations: up to 500 plants, up to 1,000 plants or up to 2,000 plants.

Under the current medical marijuana law, a five-member board appointed by the governor, Senate majority leader and speaker of the House award licenses to medical marijuana businesses. In states that allow recreational marijuana sales and use, people still can face discipline or termination if they fail an employer's drug test. Contributing: Detroit Free Press

Teddy Roosevelt hopped on whistle stop tour after whistle stop tour where he was able to drop into rural and suburban communities alike to deliver short, pre-packaged speeches that local papers would usually print verbatim. (He left them short on purpose for that very reason.) Franklin Roosevelt revolutionized and heightened the stature of the office with his fireside chats, that brought his message over the heads of the pesky press corps and directly into the living rooms of the American people. But, though it would have been seen as a scoop, even the reporters covering Lyndon B. Johnson had the good sense not to report on every turd he dropped in their presence. While the founders envisioned a government that moved slowly and methodically, today’s Wi-Fi-enabled political discourse is demanding the opposite.

President Trump had suggested lifting the prohibition, which environmentalists charge would raise levels of ground ozone during warmer months, during his campaign for the White House. Following the news of Mr. Pruitt’s resignation, Mr. Dinneen wrote that there was a “collective sigh of relief coming from the Midwest,” calling the 2019 ethanol quotas “the straw that broke the camel’s back.”
While it is too early to say how the handling of waivers or the treatment of E15 may change under new leadership, one indicator was small losses in affected refiners in early Friday trading and gains in most ethanol producers. CVR Refining, Andeavor and Delek U.S. Holdings , all of which benefited from waivers granted by the EPA, had rallied by 136%, 40% and 92% in the year ended Thursday, respectively. Ethanol companies Pacific Ethanol and Green Plains had fallen by 60% and 14%, respectively. Agricultural lobbyists often portray any easing of the rules as a sop to “big oil,” but that isn’t accurate.

The prison population has soared by 20% since the 2015 report. Almost half of all prisoners released reoffend and return to prison within two years. “As the government tightens sentencing and bail conditions, and builds more prisons, there is no indication that these trends are likely to change,” Glass said.

The Republican Party has thus far managed to continue winning elections by creating “a coalition between racists and plutocrats,” as Paul Krugman put it. The party’s economic policies are aimed at benefitting wealthy individuals and corporations, but that’s a slim segment of the American electorate. The plutocrats can fund political campaigns, but to capture enough votes to win elections, the GOP has resorted to identity politics. Research has consistently shown that Trump won because of racial resentment among white voters. Chris Hayes (@chrislhayes) The modern GOP is basically Steve Bannon, Steve King and Stephen Miller on one side engaged in a project to preserve and enshrine dominance for its ethnic/racial base, and Paul Ryan and John Roberts on the other who pretend they have no idea what they’re up to.

On this much police and activist South Side priest Michael Pfleger can agree: Saturday morning’s anti-violence march on the Dan Ryan Expressway is all about danger. Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.

Durbin’s advocacy for mass-migration and for younger ‘dreamer’ illegals has caused the Democrats much political pain. He pushed for the abortive budget-shutdown in January 2018, and for the “Gang of Eight” amnesty bill in 2013 which helped the Democrats lose nine seats in 2014. The Democrats’ top leader in the Senate, Sen. Chuck Schumer, is keeping his distance from the “Abolish ICE” campaign. He is instead using his Twitter account to tout Democrats’ promises on healthcare, guns, gay status, and claims that President Donald Trump is tied to Russian President Vladimir Putin. On the Abolish ICE campaign, Schumer is instead calling for a “czar” to focus media attention on “reunifying families.” That topic polls better for Democrats than ending immigration enforcement.
Nebraska May Join Utah, Idaho in Putting Medicaid Expansion Before Voters
Enlarge this image toggle caption Fred Knapp/NET News Fred Knapp/NET News
Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.
— MINING: The EPA said last year that it won't require mining companies to prove they have the financial resources to clean up pollution, an Obama-era rule stemming from a long history of pollution spilling from abandoned mines into streams. Pruitt said modern mining practices and existing regulations made the financial requirement unnecessary and a burden on mining. — AUTOS: Pruitt's EPA has proposed freezing vehicle fuel-efficiency standards at 2020 levels for the next five years, according to a draft of the proposal obtained by Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del. For new vehicles, that means an average of about 30 miles per gallon instead of rising to 36 mpg by 2025 as Obama's EPA proposed. — OIL AND GAS: More than a dozen states are suing the EPA for failing to take action against leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, from oil and natural gas wells.

Ineos might also have an eye to buying, though it just announced its next vast investment plan is for more than £3bn-worth of shale gas cracker plant "on the coast of north-west Europe".
In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners. Alas, he is wasting his time trying to shift the views of the Democratic Party, which has become ever more left-wing, if not outright socialist. I think it is time for Mr. James to become a Republican. Guy Randolph

It’s shocking that Mr. James is surprised by the positive economic results of less regulation and lower taxes.
Jordan has pressured rebels to reach an agreement with Russia, rebel commanders have said. The Jordanian and Israeli governments have both refused to allow Syrians fleeing the violence to cross into their countries. Jordan said it was overwhelmed with the some 1.3 million Syrian refugees already living there. Israel’s policy of not accepting refugees remains in place, a senior Israeli military official said, adding that few Syrians would want to seek asylum there. Both countries have stepped up aid deliveries into southern Syria to meet the needs of people fleeing their homes—some in vehicles piled high with their possessions and many on foot, bringing only what they can carry.
You've got to look at every issue from all sides." "I really have been pleasantly surprised how willing he is to tell Chuck Schumer to go fly a kite," she added, referring to the Senate minority leader. At other times, however, Jones has taken up liberal positions seen as risky for a Democratic senator from a GOP state. He aligned himself with most of his Democratic colleagues against Gina Haspel, Trump's pick for CIA director, arguing that her record on enhanced interrogation techniques was unacceptable. And instead of focusing on a politically safe issue in his maiden Senate floor speech, Jones struck a nerve by calling for a dialogue on gun violence after the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

It’s not strictly true to say everyone is against the three huge plant-forested glass spheres at what Amazon calls its “campus” in the heart of the city. The Bezos balls, as the conservatories are popularly known, are modelled on the greenhouses at London’s Kew Gardens, feature walkways above fig trees, ferns and rhododendrons, and provide hot-desking for Amazon workers looking for a break from the neighbouring office tower.

Some immigrant U.S. Army reservists and recruits who enlisted in the military with a promised path to citizenship are being abruptly discharged, the Associated Press has learned. The AP was unable to quantify how many men and women who enlisted through the special recruitment program have been booted from the Army, but immigration attorneys say they know of more than 40 who have been discharged or whose status has become questionable, jeopardizing their futures. "It was my dream to serve in the military," said reservist Lucas Calixto, a Brazilian immigrant who filed a lawsuit against the Army last week. "Since this country has been so good to me, I thought it was the least I could do to give back to my adopted country and serve in the United States military." Some of the service members say they were not told why they were being discharged.
There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void. In New Jersey, this is compounded by the fact that the state is located between two big cities, New York and Philadelphia, that are in other states. The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.
The services sector, where most Americans are employed, has now expanded for 101 consecutive months, or more than eight years. The gain was better than many economists had been expecting and depicts an overall economy that appears to be regaining momentum after a slowdown in the winter.

Of the challenge, Freeman says: “I have a personal and family background in the health service, and I have nothing but admiration for every person who works in our NHS whatever their job is. There have always been challenges and demands on the NHS and that will continue. I will continue and build on the commitment and excellent work of Shona Robison, my predecessor. One of the successes of our health service is that people are living longer, and that puts different demands on it. So it is critical that we are, together, able to adapt and change to meet those demands.”

Critics have also suggested that rather than being driven by genuine humanitarian concern, the principal aim of Cuban medical internationalism is to promote the regime’s image abroad and break the economic isolation imposed by the United States and other prominent western allies. It was previously estimated that Cuba makes $8 million a year from its medical trade. Follow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.

While the US tariffs aim to cut down the trade deficit, there are worries about how China's retaliatory tariffs will hit the US economy. The US Chamber of Commerce says some states will have billions of dollars worth of exports at risk. States such as Louisiana export about $5.7bn of goods to China. Several southern states, many of which also backed Trump in the election, also risk being hit.

Tweeting Saturday from New Jersey, Trump urged ICE agents to "not worry or lose your spirit" and wrote that "the radical left Dems want you out. Next it will be all police." A number of prominent Democrats have called for the outright elimination of ICE. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York said ICE has "become a deportation force," telling CNN late Thursday "you should get rid of it, start over, reimagine it and build something that actually works." Rep. Mark Pocan, a Democrat from Wisconsin, stated last week that he plans to introduce legislation to eliminate ICE.

These numbers are similar to those from a February Quinnipiac poll, where 49 percent of voters said Trump was racist and 46 percent said he was not. Forty-four percent of voters said they think “racist beliefs” were a motive in Trump’s immigration policy, while 50 percent said Trump has “a sincere interest in controlling our borders.” Sixty percent said the policy of separating children from their parents at the border was a violation of human rights. Since enacting the policy, Trump and his associates have repeatedly pushed false, racist narratives to garner support, often associating immigration with high crime rates despite no evidence to support claims that immigrants commit more crime than U.S. citizens. While only 11 percent of Republican voters in the Quinnipiac poll said they think Trump is a racist, 22 percent said they believe Trump has emboldened racist people to express their beliefs publicly. The number of hate crimes rose the year Trump was elected ― the first increase in over a decade.
Mexico's federal attorney general's office says Friday that accused drug lord Damaso Lopez has been extradited from the border city of Ciudad Juarez to the United States. Lopez is known by his alias "El Licenciado," a title for college graduates. He is facing U.S. charges of conspiring to distribute cocaine and commit money laundering and could face life imprisonment if convicted. Lopez was the right-hand man of drug kingpin Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman and helped him escape from a Mexican prison in 2001. Later, he battled Guzman's son for control of the Sinaloa cartel after the kingpin was captured in 2016.
Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.

The number of police officers in Avon and Somerset taking time off for mental health reasons has risen by 450% in less than a decade, the BBC has found. Nearly 15,000 days were lost in 2017-18, compared to about 2,700 in 2009-10, mostly due to stress and depression. Jon Owen from the Police Federation said being a officer was now "highly likely to hurt you". The force's deputy chief constable blamed staff cutbacks and "more complex" challenges for the increase.

Speaking to the media last week, Collaery said Witness K was not a whistleblower, and had gone through the proper internal channels to raise concerns about the operation. He had made a complaint to the inspector general of intelligence and security, and was given permission to disclose the operation, Collaery said. Collaery has been charged with communicating the information to ABC journalists. He was, at the time, acting for Timor-Leste in a dispute over the bugging operation at the permanent court of arbitration in The Hague.
Nearly 600 more retail jobs are to go in the UK as the Jacques Vert, Windsmoor and Precis department store brands are wound down by administrators. Administrators said they had failed to find a buyer for Calvetron Brands, which had been restructured following a rescue deal last summer. The business entered administration in May and had already shed more than 400 jobs before Wednesday’s announcement. The latest retail job losses come as more than 30,000 jobs are at risk in the UK following mass closure announcements by major chains including House of Fraser, New Look and Marks & Spencer. Retailers are suffering from rising costs and the switch to online shopping just as hard-pressed consumers rein in spending.
On this much police and activist South Side priest Michael Pfleger can agree: Saturday morning’s anti-violence march on the Dan Ryan Expressway is all about danger. Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.

"The president of the republic and his government will be absolutely respectful and support the authorities that are elected," Pena Nieto told reporters. Hovering over the election is the specter of vote fraud, though electoral officials deny it is a possibility with the modern balloting technology and institutions now in place. In both of Lopez Obrador's previous two presidential losses he alleged fraud. In his first loss — by a mere 0.56 percent to conservative Felipe Calderon in 2006 — his supporters held months-long protests in Mexico City and he referred to himself as "the legitimate president." His allies are warning even before Sunday's presidential vote that there better not be any funny business.

Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.
Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov.

Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.

Nebraska May Join Utah, Idaho in Putting Medicaid Expansion Before Voters
Enlarge this image toggle caption Fred Knapp/NET News Fred Knapp/NET News
Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.

In the survey, most say they are proud to be Americans, although Republicans feel that way more strongly (90 percent) than Democrats (61 percent). There is no consensus when asked about the country’s current course, though: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. “Overwhelming majorities of those in both parties and independents agree that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.”” USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll

"Unlike our forerunners in 1968, those of us living today have access to something they didn't," said Mary Eberstadt, a widely published Catholic writer, "50 years of sociological, psychological, medical, and other evidence about the revolution's fallout." Some of the lines in Humanae Vitae, when stripped of mid-20th century cultural references, find echoes in contemporary concerns about nonconsensual sexual relations. "A man who grows accustomed to the use of contraceptive methods may forget the reverence due to a woman," the pope wrote, "... and reduce her to a mere instrument of his own desires." "This document that has been so controversial and in many places reviled," Eberstadt says, "actually called the shots on what the future would look like better than any other single source I could think of." Revisionist views of the 1968 encyclical have even taken hold among some Catholics who have not abided by its teaching.

For new vehicles, that means an average of about 30 miles per gallon instead of rising to 36 mpg by 2025 as Obama's EPA proposed. — OIL AND GAS: More than a dozen states are suing the EPA for failing to take action against leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, from oil and natural gas wells.
In 2014, as part of a training program initiated by the United State's Global Health Security Agenda the labs at the Manipal Center for Virus Research and the National Institute of Virology in Pune were prepared to identify outbreaks of Nipah. "That training really helped us," says Arunkumar. "I ruled out other causes of encephalitis and suspected it was Nipah right away." On the evening of May 18, less than 12 hours after he received the patient's tissue samples, his lab confirmed his suspicion. The very next day, M. Miriyam, the boy's aunt, died.
That came on the heels of 0.9 percent drop in March, the first monthly drop since July of 2017. Total private construction rose 0.3 percent, with residential projects up 0.8 percent in May. New single-family home construction rose 0.6 percent and the volatile apartment building sector jumped 1.6 percent. Private, non-residential building fell 0.3 percent. Economists are forecasting that construction spending will contribute to overall growth this year even though interest rates are rising.

Analysts say tariffs are not the most effective way of putting pressure on China, which the US accuses of unfair trade practices and stealing intellectual property from US companies. Syracuse University economics professor Mary Lovely and researcher Yang Liang found 87% of electronics products to be levied by US tariffs came from multinationals and joint ventures rather than Chinese firms. China’s economy is no longer as dependent on exports. Domestic consumption now accounts for more than half of the country’s GDP. Exports to the US account for only 19% of all of China’s exports.

A Texas mother claims her son was attacked at a Whataburger in San Antonio because he was wearing a Trump-supporting MAGA hat. The mother posted a video of the incident on Facebook. The woman claimed a man became angry at her teenage son and his group of friends because one of them wore a “Make American Great Again” hat in support of President Donald Trump, KENS5 reported. The video shows the man throwing his fountain drink at the table and shouting a racial slur. In her post on Facebook, that has since been taken down, Patricia Spittler asks for help in identifying the man she called “scum bag of the year,” the San Antonio CBS affiliate reported.
In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions.

At least 41 alleged injuries have been reported, but NHTSA has yet to publicly offer any answers. Now at the two-year anniversary of the investigation, safety advocates are expressing frustration over the limited information coming out of NHTSA, reports CBS News correspondent Kris Van Cleave.

The automaker claims it "effectively resolves" the problem. NHTSA has received almost 200 complaints about the issue.
It was President Obama who left his party in this position. His anti-business agenda was unpopular, but was never revisited. Democrats’ losses over the past decade stemmed in large part from a slow-growth economy that never gained momentum. Even though he received what he called a “shellacking” in the 2010 midterms, and even though the GOP made unprecedented political gains during his tenure, President Obama was always convinced the country was behind him. As Mara Liasson wrote for NPR in 2016: “During Obama's eight years in office, the Democrats have lost more House, Senate, state legislative and governors seats than under any other president.” She noted that the Obama legacy includes “one huge failure: a diminished Democratic Party.”
In 2013, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., invoked the so-called “nuclear option,” discarding traditional filibuster protections for the minority party in favor of requiring only a simple majority to approve judicial and executive branch nominees.
Although most women are accustomed to having pap smears to test for cervical cancer -- a disease that strikes 12,000 American women each year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- a new study found pap smear alone might not be the most effective way to catch the often-preventable cancer before it progresses. Most cervical cancers are caused by a particular strains of the Human papillomavirus, or HPV. The test for detecting HPV test is simpler than a pap smear and, the study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found, it may be better at catching the earliest cervical cancer stages. Pap smears involve scraping cells from the cervix and examining them for cancerous changes, also known as "cytology" testing. They find only 55.4 percent of suspected cancer cases, according to a study by the Canadian Cervical Cancer Screening Trial Study Group, and requires a special process using a liquid medium that takes several days.
This is just terrible timing all around." Medicaid, an $11 billion, state-federal health plan in Kentucky, covers 1.4 million people, about 600,000 of them children.

The cuts to dental and vision benefits were supposed to affect only able-bodied adults, mostly those added to Medicaid under an expansion authorized through the Affordable Care Act.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.

LONDON — Over the past century American and British troops have fought side-by-side in two World Wars, Korea and the conflicts in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan. But some lawmakers and experts in the United Kingdom are warning that the British military could soon be seen as irrelevant by the United States unless it receives a colossal funding boost. "There is a concern that the U.K. is falling ever further behind and becoming even more useless from a U.S. point of view," said Andrew Dorman, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a think tank in London.

“They’ve twisted American values,” she said in a follow-up phone interview. “A lot of them are anti-God, anti-religion and anti-military.”
In the survey, most say they are proud to be Americans, although Republicans feel that way more strongly (90 percent) than Democrats (61 percent). There is no consensus when asked about the country’s current course, though: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. “Overwhelming majorities of those in both parties and independents agree that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.”” USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll
The USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll of 1,004 adults, taken online June 26-27, has a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The survey is one of a year-long series on American values.
Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.
Ethiopia's government has fired five prison officials as it confronts allegations of torture and other abuses of inmates as part of a wave of reforms. Among those fired is the federal prison chief who until recently defended the treatment of inmates as "fair." The firings came ahead of a new Human Rights Watch report released Thursday that documents widespread arbitrary detention, torture, rape and humiliation over several years in Ethiopia's eastern Somali region. It urges new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to investigate the "horrific" situation. Abiy has admitted that security forces have tortured people but has yet to "tackle Ethiopia's culture of impunity and ensure accountability," said Felix Horne, senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch.

But she was not a consensus builder.”
Nielsen founded her own consulting firm, called Sunesis Consulting; she brought on a Bush administration colleague, Elizabeth Neumann, as managing partner, and eventually expanded the suburban Washington firm to 15 people. She continued consulting on cybersecurity issues, becoming a senior fellow at The George Washington University’s Center for Cyber & Homeland Security, and working on reports and presentations on that issue and others for the World Economic Forum—the Swiss nonprofit that puts on an annual summit for global economic heavyweights in Davos, Switzerland. ***
While still running her own consulting firm in late 2016, Nielsen volunteered to advise the Trump transition team on homeland security policy. She met John Kelly during that time, and he tapped her to assist him—also as a volunteer—in his confirmation process for DHS secretary.
Infrastructure is supposed to knit us together as a nation, increasing our personal mobility and economic connectivity, but the politics of infrastructure is increasingly exposing our divides. ***
For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
This is just terrible timing all around." Medicaid, an $11 billion, state-federal health plan in Kentucky, covers 1.4 million people, about 600,000 of them children. The federal government provides about 80 percent of the state's Medicaid funds. The cuts to dental and vision benefits were supposed to affect only able-bodied adults, mostly those added to Medicaid under an expansion authorized through the Affordable Care Act.
The report also said that Strzok repeatedly pushed for more aggressive action in the Clinton probe. "The conduct by these employees cast a cloud over the entire FBI investigation and sowed doubt about the FBI’s work," the report concluded. "The damage caused by these employees’ actions extends far beyond the scope of the (Clinton) investigation and goes to the heart of the FBI’s reputation for neutral fact finding and political independence." Goelman, in an op-ed in USA TODAY last month, said Strzok has become the victim of "political gamesmanship" by Congress and President Trump, who has repeatedly tweeted about Strzok as evidence of bias by the FBI and Justice Department. "They have spent months cynically taking these texts out of context and saying that one- or two-word snippets somehow prove that the FBI investigations of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the Russia probe itself, were biased," Goelman wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report says Democrats are "likely" to carry Montana in the Senate race. Inside Elections rates the contest as one that "tilts Democratic." After the rally, the spokesman for Tester's re-election campaign put out a statement that was critical of Rosendale but which did not mention the president. "Jon's record is clear—if it's good for Montana, Jon works with anyone from either party to get things done. If it's bad for Montana, he'll stand up to anyone," Tester spokesman Chris Meagher said.

“If Trump goes ahead and institutes the first wave of tariffs, the Chinese are certainly quite prepared to strike back,” he said. “But Hollywood is not going to be in the frontline in the early period. … [Trump] is extremely unpopular in Hollywood.”
Hollywood and China have seen their relationship shift to a new model, analysts said, with major players such as Joe and Anthony Russo — the brother duo known for directing "Captain America" — setting up shop in China. The pair have backed production company Anthem & Song, based jointly in Los Angeles and Beijing, to produce Chinese-language films. Within China, the state-backed film industry has clear markings of Hollywood influence.

General Motors is one of the latest to weigh in on the threat of new tariffs targeting foreign autos and automotive parts, warning that GM could be forced to scale back production and cut U.S. jobs. GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra, who briefly served on President Donald Trump’s economic advisory council before it was disbanded last year, is the latest to come out against tariffs that could run as high as 25 percent. Harley-Davidson has already announced plans to move some production abroad, while BMW has said it would likely cut back operations at its Spartanburg, South Carolina plant that is currently the largest exporter of American-made automobiles.
Here's a quick review: Wheeler ...
Began his career in environmental law at the EPA, as a special assistant in the agency's toxics office during President George H.W. Spent years playing various roles on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, which oversees the EPA, drafting regulations on chemical safety, air and water pollution and climate change — generally seeking to reduce government regulations on industries that generate greenhouse gases. Served as longtime aide to Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., whom you may recall from the 2015 floor speech in which he rebutted climate change science with a snowball. After leaving Congress, worked for years as a lobbyist for some of the largest coal, chemical and uranium companies in the U.S. — including the uranium mining firm that pushed for the reduction of Bears Ears National Monument, which is near one of its processing facilities.
Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
NEW YORK — House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) has referred 15 individuals, including longtime Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal, for possible “open setting” testimony in the ongoing Russia investigation. The list was sent to House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA). Many of the names are tied to the discredited anti-Trump dossier produced by the controversial Fusion GPS firm, which was paid for its dossier work by both Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) via the Perkins Coie lawfirm. Indeed, Perkins Coie attorney Marc E. Elias, who reportedly was involved in arranging the payments that resulted in the dossier, made the Nunes list. As did Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson.

Ahmed served three-and-a-half years behind bars - a period of time which, he says, allowed him to finish his high school diploma, take college courses and became a local imam. But the worst was yet to come.
Trump hailed the construction of a plant he said would be "the 8th wonder of the world" as an endorsement of his policies. "We have a lot of things going in the United States," he said. But not far is the headquarters of one of the first American casualties of Trump's trade war -- Harley-Davidson. The legendary motorcycle maker says it's having to move more manufacturing overseas as a result of retaliatory EU tariffs, a decision that surprised Trump. "I've done so much for you, and then this," the president tweeted.
Many Americans gaze at the sky and see only a vast uncharted frontier for exploration. But President Donald Trump reminds Americans that there’s another potential reality in space: It could become a military battlefield, a place where this nation’s independence is protected or lost. The point isn’t to repel an alien invasion from deep space. We’re not worried about Klingons. But Americans do have reason to be concerned about technologically advancing adversaries here on Earth.

Our Founding Fathers resolved that without freedom Americans could not enjoy life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. To secure it, they fought a war to break free from the bonds of tyranny. It isn’t a faraway tyrant that oppresses us today. Rather, we are in the grip of a new kind of tyranny — that of mistrust. This tyrant sits on a throne in our minds and is just as cruel as King George was during the time of the Founders.
According to a Russian state media report related by Turkey’s Hurriyet Daily News , the United States is planning to send next-generation B61 nuclear gravity bombs to NATO bases in several European countries, including Turkey. The bomb is said to be compatible with F-35 joint strike fighters, which Turkey is also due to receive amid some controversy. Hurriyet describes the B61 nuclear bomb and Russia’s sour reaction to the prospect of NATO bases receiving them:
The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) and the U.S. Air Force completed two non-nuclear system qualification flight tests of the B61-12 gravity bomb on June 9 at Tonopah Test Range in Nevada, according to a June 29 statement by DOE/NNSA. The test, which was reportedly the first of its kind, was aimed at extending the B61 bomb’s service life by adapting it to next generation aircraft, including B-2A Spirit Bomber. “The B61-12 LEP will consolidate and replace the existing B61 bomb variants in the [U.S.] nuclear stockpile.

XI ASSERTS TERRITORIAL CLAIMS IN MEETING WITH US DEFENSE SECRETARY
Chinese President Xi Jinping strongly asserted China's determination to defend territory it claims, including in the South China Sea, in a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. While the tone of Mattis' visit to Beijing was largely upbeat, Xi made sure to reinforce his reputation as a fervent nationalist when it comes to issues of sovereignty. Though Xi gave no specifics in his statement, he was largely seen as indicating the South China Sea as well as self-governing Taiwan. China also claims territory held by India and uninhabited East China Sea islands controlled by Japan.
— MINING: The EPA said last year that it won't require mining companies to prove they have the financial resources to clean up pollution, an Obama-era rule stemming from a long history of pollution spilling from abandoned mines into streams. Pruitt said modern mining practices and existing regulations made the financial requirement unnecessary and a burden on mining. — AUTOS: Pruitt's EPA has proposed freezing vehicle fuel-efficiency standards at 2020 levels for the next five years, according to a draft of the proposal obtained by Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del. For new vehicles, that means an average of about 30 miles per gallon instead of rising to 36 mpg by 2025 as Obama's EPA proposed. — OIL AND GAS: More than a dozen states are suing the EPA for failing to take action against leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, from oil and natural gas wells.

President Donald Trump should give Mexico’s next president the benefit of the doubt — if nothing else because they’re largely alike.
There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void. In New Jersey, this is compounded by the fact that the state is located between two big cities, New York and Philadelphia, that are in other states. The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.
This was particularly an issue for Pruitt’s former executive scheduler Sydney Hupp, who often had to shell out for Pruitt’s trips. Hupp was also asked by Pruitt to speak with staff at one of Trump’s hotels, believing he could get a deal on a second-hand mattress they were selling. Pruitt remained miserly even when he was abusing his position to get a good deal. He fell behind on the rental payments on the condo he was getting on the cheap and eventually had to be evicted and the locks were changed.
The government will appoint a national LGBT health adviser and take measures to end so-called conversion therapy as part of a plan to deliver what Theresa May has promised will be “real and lasting change”. The proposals form part of an action plan published by the Equalities Office on Tuesday. It follows a UK-wide survey of LGBT people that had more than 108,000 responses, billed as the largest study of its kind. The 30-page plan contains a series of pledges, including to improve the police response to LGBT hate incidents, more support for LGBT students and teachers and improvements to gender identity services for transgender adults. The proposals, which will receive an initial £4.5m in funding, were welcomed by the campaign groups Stonewall and the LGBT Foundation.
As well as a new president, Mexican will be voting for 128 senators and 500 deputies in Congress as well as state and local officials. In all, 88 million people will be eligible to vote. Mexico is the second largest economy in Latin America and a major oil exporter. However, oil prices have dropped and the Mexican currency, the peso, has fallen sharply against the dollar. More than 40% of the population lives in poverty and high levels of corruption and violence have led some companies to pull out of the worst affected areas.
The concrete inside the tunnels has been eroding since Superstorm Sandy flooded them with millions of gallons of brackish water in 2012, and the 12,000-volt copper electric cables inside the concrete periodically short-circuit and melt down. “It’s like a volcano erupting,” said Mike Siwiec, an Amtrak electrical specialist who showed me the frayed remains of a cable that ruptured and gridlocked the city in 2015. Meanwhile, the rickety Portal Bridge fails to close properly one of every seven times it opens, though maintenance crews can sometimes bash it back into alignment with a sledgehammer. The 9-mile stretch between Newark and New York City is now a chokepoint for the entire Northeast Corridor; whenever one of its two tunnels goes out of service, train traffic decreases 75 percent, and whenever the Portal Bridge can’t close, train traffic halts completely. It’s hard to calculate the precise economic impact of losing a key entryway to a city that accounts for 10 percent of U.S. GDP, but Gateway’s boosters peg it at $100 million a day.
That leaves the broader theory that Deutsche Bank’s loans to Trump were somehow illicit. Yet this, too, doesn’t add up. How would the White House leverage that information against Anthony Kennedy? Trump would have to threaten to reveal it to the public—but that would incriminate him, too. Assume, for the sake of argument, that Justin Kennedy did commit a white-collar crime in his dealings with Trump.
"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.
The issue of whether to welcome refugees to the state has proved controversial. In 2015, opponents of a federally funded refugee welcoming center in Twin Falls, Idaho, campaigned unsuccessfully for the facility to be closed.

"Peace and tranquility are the fruits of justice," Lopez Obrador said. Exit polling by Consulta Mitofsky for the Televisa network forecast gubernatorial wins for allies of Lopez Obrador's Morena party in at least four of eight state races on the ballot plus for the head of government in Mexico City. The central state of Guanajuato was expected to go to a candidate of the conservative National Action Party. Mitofsky predicted Morena allies would take between 56 and 70 seats in the 128-member Senate and between 256 and 291 spots in the 500-seat lower house. "The anger that the average Mexican feels toward the way things are being governed has favored Lopez Obrador," said Shannon O'Neil, senior fellow for Latin America Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Kinner was being held without bail at the Ada County jail on 15 charges, including six of injury to a child and nine of aggravated battery, jail records showed. There was no lawyer listed for Kinner in the records. Kinner may have wanted to “extract vengeance” for being kicked out by a tenant who took him in, Police Chief Bill Bones said at a press conference on Sunday. The woman who took Kinner in was not harmed and was not at the residence at the time of the attack. Kinner assaulted the children at the party after he was unable to find the woman, police said, adding his motive was still under investigation.

But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said. Tackett said he's concerned about children, especially in Eastern Kentucky, which has a higher rate of Medicaid patients and some of the state's worst oral health. "I have no problem with them regulating the adults that are on Medicaid," Tackett said. "If they are young and healthy, they should be out working or doing something.
They are even now talking about two other former Kennedy clerks for the Supreme Court, Judges Brett Kavanaugh and Ray Kethledge. And they've put a bunch of Kennedy clerks onto the lower courts. And they seem to exploit some connections between the Kennedy and Trump families. Justice Kennedy's son, Justin, had business dealings with President Trump. Ivanka Trump visited the Supreme Court at Justice Kennedy's invitation after the two of them met after the inauguration.
Under the sanctions, any assets belonging to the three officials in the United States are blocked and U.S. citizens are prohibited from engaging in transactions with them or entities they own or control, the Treasury said in a statement. “The violence perpetrated by the government of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega against the Nicaraguan people and the efforts of those close to the Ortega regime to illicitly enrich themselves is deeply disturbing and completely unacceptable,” Sigal Mandelker, undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a statement. The United States accused Madriz of ordering the Nicaraguan police to set fire to a house in the capital, Managua, killing six people, including two children. It said police also asked gang leaders in Nicaragua to attack anti-government protesters, fired on and killed peaceful protesters. Briones ordered attacks against elderly and young people protesting peacefully, ordered violent attacks against anti-government marchers and beat protesters and stole money from Managua municipal projects, according to the Treasury.
"There are no shortcuts to this, we have to have more capacity in the system," he said. Child to adult - why the cliff edge? Another young woman who had spent some time in adolescent inpatient units described her feelings of being let down by the system as she entered adult services.

Even Pruitt’s own staff had begun to sour on him, with many worrying that their future career prospects would be damaged by their association with Pruitt’s tenure. Each scandal seemed more damning than the last. Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
A new USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll about patriotism, pegged to this week's celebration of the Fourth of July, finds an overwhelming majority of those surveyed — 90 percent — say they are proud to be Americans. But they split almost down the middle, 42 percent to 39 percent, when asked whether they are proud of America right now. Not surprisingly, the split was along partisan lines: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. There was bipartisan agreement on one thing: Across party lines, roughly seven in 10 agree with the statement, "I feel fatigued watching the news." Elsewhere in politics

China Mobile has reportedly been censoring content banned by the Chinese government’s “great firewall,” even when Chinese citizens are in the United States — prompting the FCC to debate its license. According to the Washington Post, on Monday, the U.S. Department of Commerce “recommended the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) deny a license to China Mobile, the state-run company that is the world’s largest phone network by subscribers.”
“The Commerce Department suggested the move because of the national security risk China Mobile poses,” they explained, adding that China Mobile is an “arm of the Chinese state,” and that “those with China Mobile as their carrier are often unable to access American websites and apps that are banned in China.”
One Chinese journalist was reportedly unable to access Facebook, the New York Times, and Google Maps from their phone while in the United States. Another user, Shanghai analyst May Sun, warned that the “Great Firewall” doesn’t stop when you enter the United States as a Chinese citizen. “[It] is exactly the same as when you surf on the Internet at home,” May Sun declared. “You still don’t have access to what is blocked by the Great Firewall.”
In a statement, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) called China Mobile an “unacceptable risk.”
“Granting the authorization poses an unacceptable risk to U.S. national security and law enforcement,” NTIA proclaimed.

Nebraska May Join Utah, Idaho in Putting Medicaid Expansion Before Voters

Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.
He said many of the people he has talked to were either traveling or away for work when the blaze started Thursday and have not been able to find out the status of their homes. Authorities in Oregon are urging hikers and other outdoors enthusiasts to avoid forested areas near the Oregon-California border, where a blaze has killed one person. The Jackson County Sheriff's Office said Friday that although the blaze has not crossed into Oregon, officials are concerned people in remote areas could be unreachable in case they need to quickly evacuate. It says the areas of concern include the Pacific Crest Trail, Mount Ashland and the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument.
Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement announcement has set off a political tempest as the question of his successor is considered. Among those reported to be among the top of President Donald Trump’s short list is Judge Brett Kavanaugh on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The prospect of a Justice Kavanaugh worries some consumer advocates, who say he has taken an activist position against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the regulator implemented in the wake of the Great Recession in the hopes of thwarting future financial meltdowns.
Over the fireplace at Mingo Creek Craft Distillers, a whiskey purveyor in the small town of Washington, Pennsylvania, a portrait of Alexander Hamilton hangs upside down. With snowy hair and a black velvet jacket, Hamilton wears an impassive look that might be described as hauteur. In 1791, to pay off debts the newly formed United States incurred during the revolutionary war, Hamilton imposed the first federal tax on the people of the region. By taxing their most lucrative product, whiskey, he became what he is here today: a villain representing the excesses of the federal government. The town of Washington is only a six-hour drive from Manhattan, but it’s a world away from the Broadway stage where Hamilton, clad in snug white knickers, enjoys a better reputation.

Mr. Sorrell has said that S4 Capital is too small to compete with the world’s largest ad firm.
Must landlords provide proof that they, too, have never paid a utility bill late? Certain landlords require 12 months’ rent up front, even three years’ worth of audited accounts, when precarious workers can’t afford upwards of £400 for an accountant. Character references for guarantors have been mandated, along with insisting that even “elderly” renters (ie those over 75), provide guarantors. Older tenants are increasingly reliant on the private sector, and unlikely to have parents or employers to ask (although with extended working lives, maybe that will change).

"I really have been pleasantly surprised how willing he is to tell Chuck Schumer to go fly a kite," she added, referring to the Senate minority leader. At other times, however, Jones has taken up liberal positions seen as risky for a Democratic senator from a GOP state. He aligned himself with most of his Democratic colleagues against Gina Haspel, Trump's pick for CIA director, arguing that her record on enhanced interrogation techniques was unacceptable. And instead of focusing on a politically safe issue in his maiden Senate floor speech, Jones struck a nerve by calling for a dialogue on gun violence after the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida.

And instead of focusing on a politically safe issue in his maiden Senate floor speech, Jones struck a nerve by calling for a dialogue on gun violence after the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida. In addition, during the campaign, Jones made no secret of his desire to protect LGBTQ rights and to support a woman's right to abortion. It's those kinds of positions that have made him a darling of Alabama's progressive minority — and somewhat of a public enemy among the state's conservative majority. Jones has introduced four pieces of legislation — none of any huge significance — since he arrived on Capitol Hill, including two agriculture bills, one that would expand access to capital for rural job creators and the last seeking to mandate an annual Medicaid expansion review.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) spent a total of $4 billion on improper food stamp payments to those receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the USDA confirmed with Breitbart News on Friday. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service announced this week that improper payments made up 6.3 percent of SNAP money in the fiscal year (FY) 2017—the latest data available from the agency. Breitbart News analyzed the USDA’s data on food stamp spending and found that $4,007,026,532 of the $63,603,595,754 the agency spent on SNAP in FY 2017 went to improper payments. The USDA told Breitbart News that “it is important to note that improper payments include both overpayments and underpayments,” meaning that households on SNAP that received less than what they were supposed to receive for the month are also included in the percentage rate. Brandon Lipps, the Acting Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services at the agency, said that most improper payments are due to “human errors”—either because of state agencies miscalculating benefits or benefit recipients giving state agencies the wrong information.

Fox News again dominated for the second quarter of 2018 not only in cable news, but in all of cable, while CNN landed in last place by a country mile. For the eighth straight quarter, Fox was the most-watched network in all of cable. With an average of 1.409 million total day viewers, Fox attracted nearly as many eyeballs as MSNBC and CNN combined. MSNBC averaged just 930,000 viewers, while CNN nosedived with an average of just 658,000. During primetime, Fox snagged an average of 2.447 million viewers, compared to MSNBC’s 1.736 million.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
The president told Fox News that he believes his nominee will get some support from Democrats. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, an abortion rights supporter, is considered one of the key votes on a nominee. She said she wouldn't vote for someone who would overturn Roe v. Wade. "A candidate who would overturn Roe would not be acceptable," she said Sunday on ABC's This Week. Collins, who has previously bucked party lines on other key issues such as health care, said she plans to have an in-depth conversation with the nominee.
Kinner was being held without bail at the Ada County jail on 15 charges, including six of injury to a child and nine of aggravated battery, jail records showed. There was no lawyer listed for Kinner in the records. Kinner may have wanted to “extract vengeance” for being kicked out by a tenant who took him in, Police Chief Bill Bones said at a press conference on Sunday. The woman who took Kinner in was not harmed and was not at the residence at the time of the attack. Kinner assaulted the children at the party after he was unable to find the woman, police said, adding his motive was still under investigation.

In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners. Alas, he is wasting his time trying to shift the views of the Democratic Party, which has become ever more left-wing, if not outright socialist. I think it is time for Mr. James to become a Republican. Guy Randolph

It’s shocking that Mr. James is surprised by the positive economic results of less regulation and lower taxes.
The list of Democrats expressing frustration with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has been growing longer in recent weeks, but don’t expect to see former President Barack Obama’s name on it. At a party fundraising event Friday afternoon in Northern California, Obama spoke highly of Pelosi – and even predicted that she will return to the job of House speaker after November’s midterm elections. “I think everybody knows how much I love Nancy Pelosi,” Obama told the gathering at a home in affluent Atherton, Politico reported. "Nancy, I believe, is one of the greatest speakers we ever had, and will once again be one of the greatest speakers we ever have after we get through this cycle," he continued. “And there's not much I could have gotten done without having Nancy there alongside of me every step of the way.”

The first, Antonio Halili, was the mayor of the much larger Tanauan City, south of Manila. Unlike Bote, Halili had developed both a reputation for having a heavy hand against drug traffickers and negotiating with them. Halili appeared on a more recent Duterte list of elected officials with ties to drug trafficking in 2017. Shortly after Halili’s assassination, Duterte told reporters, “I don’t know who killed him, but I told you don’t [engage in illegal drugs]. … His procession of drug suspects was just a front.”
Prior to this accusation, however, Halili had established a “walk of shame” program where he paraded drug suspects around his city for the public to jeer, leading others in the government to suggest he was killed by drug traffickers in revenge for humiliating their peers.
"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.

Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey has apologised to Parliament for making "inadvertently misleading" statements about Universal Credit. She said she had "mistakenly" told MPs on Monday the National Audit Office felt the benefit was progressing too slowly and should be rolled out faster. The head of the spending watchdog had said the claims were "incorrect" as it had reservations about the process. Labour had called on Ms McVey to apologise or "consider her position". Ms McVey told MPs that she had meant to say that the spending watchdog believed there was "no practical alternative" to the development of Universal Credit, which rolls six benefits into one.

The services sector, where most Americans are employed, has now expanded for 101 consecutive months, or more than eight years. The gain was better than many economists had been expecting and depicts an overall economy that appears to be regaining momentum after a slowdown in the winter.
Hamilton, the Republican state lawmaker who beat the incumbent Karnes, won with a mix of support from teachers and other unions. While Karnes sparred with teachers during the strike, Hamilton took a moderate position. He aligned with teachers unions by opposing state right-to-work legislation and the proposed repeal of prevailing wage laws for public construction projects. The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.
Pentagon Questioned Over Blackout On War Zone Troop Numbers
Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images
For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.
"People who use opioids, including heroin, were up to 13 times more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system," says Winkelman. The study shows the complexity of the the opioid crisis, according to Josiah Rich, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Brown University, who wasn't involved in the research. It shows "the spectrum of the disease and its overlap with the criminal justice system, showing that the more you progress along that continuum, the more likely you are to get tangled up in the criminal justice system." The study also showed that most people with opioid use disorder had other mental illnesses and were also more likely to have certain chronic health conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The study authors argue for the need to engage and involve the criminal justice system in dealing with the opioid epidemic, including reducing overdose deaths.

Nuclear wouldn't count toward the 50 percent mandate, and APS says its Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station is the largest electricity producer in the U.S.
Jeff Burke, APS director of resources planning, says customers would see 6 to 14 percent per year increases on their bills if the company is forced to ratchet up renewable use ahead of schedule. "We continue to add renewables to our system, but they have to make sense," Burke said. "It's not really about a target, it's about what makes sense for our customers' usage and what makes rates affordable and what keeps our system reliable." Thirty-two states with renewable standards didn't have, on average, a correlated rate increase, according to Wesley Hersche, an associate director of research with Arizona State University's Global Security Initiative. "These issues involve a complex interaction of factors, and we should be careful not to oversimplify things," Hersche wrote in April.
For example, Hannah Dreier reported of a case in which parents remained jailed at the border while their 9-year-old was deported back to Mexico alone and put into foster care. Reuniting those families will require coordinating with Mexican authorities, something the Trump administration is unlikely to do unless pushed. Moreover, the judge has left a potential loophole, allowing for separations to continue if there has been a “determination that the parent is unfit or poses a danger to the child.” While this is in accordance with dependency law—the law governing the removal of children from their parents—there are not yet any judicial checks in place to ensure that any administrative determinations of “unfitness” or “danger” to the child do not continue to be unlawful and arbitrary. The law in this area is clear. As Judge Sabraw—a George W. Bush appointee—noted, due process, including a reasonable hearing on parental fitness, is required before the government can interfere with a parent’s right to raise his or her own child.
It was no surprise to read that the very first lesson you suggest could be learned from overseas (Five things the NHS could do to improve service, 3 July) is the establishment of integrated health and social care, as has happened in New Zealand. The achievements of the Attlee government are at the heart of my socialist beliefs but the compromises which led then to the split between free NHS care and means-tested social care remain the achilles heel as the NHS celebrates 70 years. It is utterly ludicrous to have separate systems which imply distinct and neat boundaries between health and care, with rather a lot of people making a good living arguing on which side of the fence some poor demented soul belongs. Disputes around the funding of continuing care have become a major industry. The recent NHS funding announcement, making no reference whatsoever to social care, evidenced the fact that the government still hasn’t the least idea of how the two are umbilically linked.
PORTLAND, Ore. -- Two opposing protest groups -- Patriot Prayer and antifa -- clashed in downtown Portland Saturday, CBS Portland affiliate KOIN reports. Portland police said failure to leave the area could leave to arrests, calling the demonstration a riot. More than 100 members of Patriot Prayer group gathered at Terry Schrunk Plaza for a "freedom rally," while more than 100 counter protesters with an antifa group gathered across the street at Chapman Square for rallies before a march. Police revoked Patriot Prayer's permit for the rally after the two groups began to clash. People were lighting firecrackers and smoke bombs in the crowd while police used flash bangs in an effort to disperse the clashing protesters.

How will he behave toward those members of his very odd coalition is anyone’s guess.
Republicans are more likely to rate secure borders as a strong value; Democrats are more likely to rate welcoming immigrants and refugees as a strong value. In follow-up interviews, there was angst over the Trump administration policy, now modified, of separating children from their parents when they cross the border illegally. "There's always been immigrants; that's what this country is," says Kimberly Bainter, 29, of Norfolk, Virginia. The United States has become "less welcoming" than it used to be, says Harry Bridgen, 56, a band manager from Studio City, California, adding, "How scared and alone these children must feel." Hundreds of thousands rallied across the country Saturday to protest the immigration policy that resulted in more than 2,000 children separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border.

The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. Teachers are also running a ballot measure campaign that would tax the highest income earners for an additional $690 million to spend on schools. “Regardless of political parties, we need people to make a decision about what’s happening in the classroom,” said Marisol Garcia, vice president of the Arizona Education Association. “To limit ourselves and to say ‘only these people are going to support us’ is just not true.”
Teachers can be at a disadvantage compared to wealthier candidates, who tend to have built-in networks of potential donors.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services sector activity picked up in June amid strong growth in new orders, but trade tariffs and a shortage of workers were starting to strain the supply chain, which could slow momentum in the coming months.

While other data on Thursday showed private payrolls rising less than expected last month and a surprise increase in new applications for unemployment benefits last week, overall labor market conditions continue to tighten. The labor market is considered to be near or at full employment, with the jobless rate at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent. The unemployment rate has dropped by three-tenths of a percentage point this year and is near the Federal Reserve’s forecast of 3.6 percent by the end of this year.

'THIS IS YOUR RECEIPT': Jarrod W. Ramos, the man suspected of killing five people during an attack on the Capital Gazette newspaper last week in Annapolis, Maryland, sent multiple threatening letters prior to the shooting, police revealed on Monday ... The paper’s former attorney gave police mail he received at his law office on Monday, the newspaper's former publisher Thomas Marquardt told The Baltimore Sun. One of those documents, dated June 28 – the same day as the shooting – allegedly included a letter from Ramos in which he said he was en route to the paper “with the objective of killing every person present.”
The letter was written in the form of a “Motion for Reconsideration” by a Maryland court following a 2016 refusal to hear Ramos’ defamation case that he had filed against the outlet. That stemmed from a 2011 column published in the paper about a criminal harassment charge against Ramos that was filed by a former high school classmate. “You were too cowardly to confront those lies, and this is your receipt,” he allegedly wrote.
“We are not going to fight. We are always going to seek for there to be an agreement. … We are going to extend our frank hand to seek a relation of friendship, I repeat, of cooperation with the United States.”
Trump was equally tactful, telling reporters: “I think he’s going to try and help us with the border. “I think the relationship will be a very good one,” the US president said of the Mexican politician, whose swearing-in will be in December. “We talked about trade, we talked about Nafta, we talked about a separate deal, just Mexico and the United States.”
Such restraint contrasted with Trump’s call to López Obrador’s predecessor, weeks after his inauguration last year.

STAT OF THE DAY, via WaPo’s Abigail Hauslohner and Andrew Ba Tran: “The number of people receiving visas to move permanently to the United States is on pace to drop 12 percent in President Trump’s first two years in office, according to a Washington Post analysis of State Department data. “Among the most affected are the Muslim-majority countries on the president’s travel ban list -- Yemen, Syria, Iran, Libya and Somalia -- where the number of new arrivals to the United States is heading toward an 81 percent drop by Sept. 30, the end of the second fiscal year under Trump.” https://wapo.st/2tODvE0

Illustration: HuffPost; Photos: Reuters Ieshia Evans is detained by law enforcement as she protests the shooting death of Alton Sterling near the headquarters of the Baton Rouge Police Department in Louisiana, U.S. July 9, 2016. As she sat cloistered inside her Baton Rouge jail cell on a July afternoon in 2016, Ieshia Evans initially had no clue she’d become an icon. As she remembers, food and sleep were the only things on her mind in the 24 hours she spent incarcerated. Evans had traveled from her home in New York City to Louisiana to protest against police brutality and the killing of Alton Sterling, an unarmed black man shot to death by Baton Rouge police. As thousands gathered in Baton Rouge for the July 9 protests, Evans walked into the middle of the street to oppose an advancing row of officers in riot gear.

Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.
In their statement, Mr Netanyahu and Mr Morawiecki praised the Polish wartime government-in-exile, saying it tried to "raise awareness among Western allies of the systematic murder" of Polish Jews. They also said structures of the Polish underground state supervised by the Polish government-in-exile "created a mechanism of systematic help and support to Jewish people". However Yad Vashem said this contradicted decades of historical research and contained "grave errors and deceptions". It said much of the Polish resistance in its various movements "not only failed to help Jews, but was also not infrequently actively involved in persecuting them". Polish assistance to Jews during the Holocaust was "relatively rare", Yad Vashem said, and "attacks against and even the murder of Jews were widespread".
The list of Democrats expressing frustration with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has been growing longer in recent weeks, but don’t expect to see former President Barack Obama’s name on it. At a party fundraising event Friday afternoon in Northern California, Obama spoke highly of Pelosi – and even predicted that she will return to the job of House speaker after November’s midterm elections. “I think everybody knows how much I love Nancy Pelosi,” Obama told the gathering at a home in affluent Atherton, Politico reported. "Nancy, I believe, is one of the greatest speakers we ever had, and will once again be one of the greatest speakers we ever have after we get through this cycle," he continued. “And there's not much I could have gotten done without having Nancy there alongside of me every step of the way.”

"Unlike our forerunners in 1968, those of us living today have access to something they didn't," said Mary Eberstadt, a widely published Catholic writer, "50 years of sociological, psychological, medical, and other evidence about the revolution's fallout." Some of the lines in Humanae Vitae, when stripped of mid-20th century cultural references, find echoes in contemporary concerns about nonconsensual sexual relations. "A man who grows accustomed to the use of contraceptive methods may forget the reverence due to a woman," the pope wrote, "... and reduce her to a mere instrument of his own desires." "This document that has been so controversial and in many places reviled," Eberstadt says, "actually called the shots on what the future would look like better than any other single source I could think of." Revisionist views of the 1968 encyclical have even taken hold among some Catholics who have not abided by its teaching.
Nebraska May Join Utah, Idaho in Putting Medicaid Expansion Before Voters
Enlarge this image toggle caption Fred Knapp/NET News Fred Knapp/NET News
Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.
There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void. In New Jersey, this is compounded by the fact that the state is located between two big cities, New York and Philadelphia, that are in other states. The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.
Amazon has long been accused of stretching the city’s transit and education systems, and its highly paid workers have driven up prices of goods and housing. The resentful murmur recently became a roar after Amazon reacted to the city’s latest tax proposal, which would have charged large businesses an annual $275 per employee, by resorting to what critics call blackmail. In mid-June, less than a month after unanimously passing the tax, Seattle’s council abandoned it in the face of threats from the corporation. The tension has sharpened the debate about whether the city can retain its identity as one of the most progressive in the country, or is destined to be just another tech hub. Ironically, given Amazon’s much-publicised “city sweepstakes”, in which municipalities in North America are competing to land the company’s second headquarters, Seattle did not reach a Faustian pact with Amazon to lure it in the first place.
Nearly 600 more retail jobs are to go in the UK as the Jacques Vert, Windsmoor and Precis department store brands are wound down by administrators. Administrators said they had failed to find a buyer for Calvetron Brands, which had been restructured following a rescue deal last summer. The business entered administration in May and had already shed more than 400 jobs before Wednesday’s announcement. The latest retail job losses come as more than 30,000 jobs are at risk in the UK following mass closure announcements by major chains including House of Fraser, New Look and Marks & Spencer. Retailers are suffering from rising costs and the switch to online shopping just as hard-pressed consumers rein in spending.
A Texas mother claims her son was attacked at a Whataburger in San Antonio because he was wearing a Trump-supporting MAGA hat. The mother posted a video of the incident on Facebook. The woman claimed a man became angry at her teenage son and his group of friends because one of them wore a “Make American Great Again” hat in support of President Donald Trump, KENS5 reported. The video shows the man throwing his fountain drink at the table and shouting a racial slur. In her post on Facebook, that has since been taken down, Patricia Spittler asks for help in identifying the man she called “scum bag of the year,” the San Antonio CBS affiliate reported.

KTVA: “Saturday afternoon, Alan and Shandy Cuellar held their fairytale wedding at the Bayshore Clubhouse in south Anchorage in front of nearly 100 of their family and friends -- and a curious moose. Just days before the wedding, Shandy went to the venue to meet with her wedding coordinator to go over the setup. As they were looking around, they noticed a moose at the pond and they both said how amazing it would be if that was the backdrop to their wedding photos. Sure enough, just before the couple’s first kiss as husband and wife, they heard something behind them.

Public support for abortion rights “remains as high as it has been in two decades of polling”, according to Pew Research, with 57% “saying abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 40% say it should be illegal in all or most cases”. “It’s clear that Donald Trump seeks to put forward a narrow-minded elitist who will protect corporations, the wealthy and the powerful, and individuals who will dismantle Roe, take away critical rights of LGBT Americans and eliminate healthcare for millions of people,” said Goldberg, referring to Roe v Wade, the 1973 decision protecting abortion rights. “All of these rights have been hard-won over decades, and it’s no exaggeration to say the right wants to put on the bench an individual that will turn the clock back.”

In rulings on issues such as workplace arbitration, sexual harassment, voting rights, consumer rights and civil rights, the court could have a particuilar impact on society’s most vulnerable. “I think the reality is that the court’s influence on everyday lives is felt most directly by those who tend to depend upon government, those who may not be in a socio-economic position to adequately vindicate their own rights without some government assistance,” said Vladeck.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
BREAKING: @NEAToday President @Lily_NEA reacts to radical ruling by #SCOTUS: "We are living in a system that is rigged to benefit special interests & billionaires, all at the expense of working people."

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.
The proposal would:
Legalize the possession and sale of up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana for personal, recreational use for people over the age of 21. A person could keep up to 10 ounces of marijuana at home. Tax marijuana sales with a 10 percent excise tax at the retail level as well as the state's 6 percent sales tax. Split those revenues, with 35 percent going to K-12 education, 35 percent to roads, 15 percent to the communities that allow marijuana businesses in their communities and 15 percent to counties where marijuana business are located. Allow communities to decide whether they’ll allow marijuana businesses in their towns.
It's really taking the supermarket and the mall and bring it to us, if you think about it," said Leigh Gallagher, Fortune magazine's senior editor at large.

Amazon is offering to help entrepreneurs start and manage a delivery business with potential $10,000 reimbursements for some candidates and vehicle leases. Gallagher said Amazon is "so focused on the consumer, it just spends and spends and spends."

The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.
Universities deploying obstetricians to the region are focusing on an Odate hospital partly because there were too few pregnancies in Kazuno. “Childbirth is the very foundation of any region. This could become the primary factor to push Kazuno into a decline,” said Daisuke Anbo, a leader of a citizens’ group seeking to restore labor and delivery services there. Already, one-third of the prefecture’s companies allow employees to keep working after 70, the highest rate in Japan. At Akita city’s Asahi Taxi, more than half of its 148 drivers are 65 or older.
They said there are over 300 German automotive facilities in the United States, supporting nearly 120,000 jobs. Instead of imposing tariffs, Merkel said the United States should work with its partners to find a multilateral solution that address its trade complaints. ''Germany will do everything to prevent the situation from escalating," she said. -- Nadine Schmidt and Kevin Tschierse contributed reporting.
The bidding war thrusts Mr. Sorrell into direct competition for the first time against the company he spent three decades building. Mr. Sorrell has said that S4 Capital is too small to compete with the world’s largest ad firm. But his stated interest in the technology, data and content sectors places him firmly in a space where ad holding companies like WPP are trying to grow, particularly through acquisitions. Inflexion Private Equity was also interested in MediaMonks, although it is unclear whether it actually placed a bid, a person familiar with the matter said. Mr. Sorrell resigned as CEO of WPP in April after The Wall Street Journal reported that the company’s board had been looking into an allegation of improper personal behavior and whether Mr. Sorrell had misused company assets.
The court documents detail the accounts of four unnamed women, identified as Jane Does 1, 2, 3, and 4. Local reports cited depositions that Large took before his death wherein he reportedly admitted to suggesting some of the women participate in "catfight videos" for money, but he denied the claims of sexual assault. Now his five of his former supervisors, police department, and Horry County officials are facing claims from two of the victims, Jane Does 3 and 4, for allegedly failing to prevent years of egregious abuse. Large died in January, 16 months after he was indicted. On Monday, a judge rejected a motion for summary judgment from the defendants and decided the case would move forward with a trial against the Horry County Police Department and Horry County.
Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned the Trump administration that hitting auto imports with new tariffs would have dire consequences. ''We now have tariffs on aluminum and steel and we have a discussion that is far more serious," Merkel told German lawmakers on Wednesday. "This is taking on the contours of a trade conflict — I don't want to use words that go any further. It's worth every effort to try and defuse this so that this conflict does not become a war.'' President Donald Trump has threatened to place a 20% tariff on all European cars coming to the United States if the European Union doesn't remove its own trade barriers.
Like most foundation forums, it was a spectacular event, drawing everyone from MacArthur Foundation “genius grant” winner Rami Nashashibi to philanthropic organizations to Tony- and Grammy-winning performer Daveed Diggs. Notably absent, though, was Obama. He did speak briefly in a taped video greeting. Still, Betts said, the forum accomplished what it set out to do — bring people to the table and get beyond the notion that the center is only for one part of town. “Having this global foundation go beyond the South Side and give others the chance to feel like they are being engaged is important,” Betts said.
These numbers are similar to those from a February Quinnipiac poll, where 49 percent of voters said Trump was racist and 46 percent said he was not. Forty-four percent of voters said they think “racist beliefs” were a motive in Trump’s immigration policy, while 50 percent said Trump has “a sincere interest in controlling our borders.” Sixty percent said the policy of separating children from their parents at the border was a violation of human rights. Since enacting the policy, Trump and his associates have repeatedly pushed false, racist narratives to garner support, often associating immigration with high crime rates despite no evidence to support claims that immigrants commit more crime than U.S. citizens. While only 11 percent of Republican voters in the Quinnipiac poll said they think Trump is a racist, 22 percent said they believe Trump has emboldened racist people to express their beliefs publicly. The number of hate crimes rose the year Trump was elected ― the first increase in over a decade.

Murphy got $25 million toward his initiative to eventually make community college free — five times what Sweeney had proposed in the Legislature’s budget, but just half of what the governor originally sought. “Having achieved a budget that includes historic investments in NJ TRANSIT and education and meets our pension obligations, which are paid for in part by new revenues from a millionaires tax and closing corporate loopholes, there is one clear winner in this year’s budget process: New Jersey’s middle class,” said Dan Bryan, a spokesman for Murphy, in a statement Sunday. “The era of budget gimmicks and favoring the wealthy and corporations in New Jersey is ending, and the era of a stronger and fairer New Jersey is just beginning.”
At their press conference Saturday evening, Murphy and Sweeney both glossed over the insults they had lobbed each other. “We had honest, blunt, sometimes heated but always civil discussions,” Murphy said. “It’s never been a disagreement on where we wanted to go.
And next year at this time I want us to have this convention in Tehran.”
He said President Trump’s leadership had made it so that “we are now realistically being able to see an end to the regime in Iran.”
In her speech, Rajavi said, “Since the January uprising, the signs of change in Iran and the regime’s overthrow have appeared. The prospects for the victory of Iran’s democratic revolution, devoid of the mullahs and the shah are looming.” She added, “Through their uprisings and by relying on resistance units, the Iranian people have the leverage they need to topple this regime.”
Saturday’s rally coincided with a series of large street protests in Iran over the Islamic Republic’s dwindling economy and a plunge in the value of its currency, the rial. Several protests took place at Tehran’s Grand Bazaar last week but continued and became violent as the Iranian government’s forces opened fire on residents protesting in Khorramshahr over the lack of potable water in the city’s pipelines. Iranian Arabs, a severely underserved portion of the Islamic Republic’s population, also participated in the protests.

The major U.S. stock indexes were mostly higher in early trading Friday following a solid jobs report, keeping the market on track for a weekly gain after two weeks of losses. The modest gains came despite an escalation in global trade tensions as the U.S. imposed tariffs on billions in Chinese goods and China responded in kind. Health care stocks posted the biggest gains, led by Biogen. The drugmaker's stock soared 18 percent to $353.28 on encouraging results from an Alzheimer's therapy. Industrials companies took some of the biggest losses.
When the leaders of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) crowed on Tuesday that they were "hunting the union, driving it before us" they were not entirely wrong in claiming triumph over the CDU and CSU. Mrs Merkel has failed to achieve her original dream - a Europe that would truly share the responsibility for sheltering asylum seekers. At last week's summit of EU leaders she thrashed out a much tougher policy, working alongside populist governments and other leaders who cherish national interests above those of the European Union. Exhausted and embattled, Angela Merkel is having to adapt to a changed Europe.

Lazer’s record included the apprehension of 93 illegal aliens prior to his tragic death.

Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) trashed the June jobs report — even though it showed rapid job growth, rising wages, and low unemployment. The report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that employers created 213,000 new jobs in June — 22,000 more than economists had expected. Manufacturing jobs in particular rose by 36,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.

Jeff Burke, APS director of resources planning, says customers would see 6 to 14 percent per year increases on their bills if the company is forced to ratchet up renewable use ahead of schedule. "We continue to add renewables to our system, but they have to make sense," Burke said. "It's not really about a target, it's about what makes sense for our customers' usage and what makes rates affordable and what keeps our system reliable." Thirty-two states with renewable standards didn't have, on average, a correlated rate increase, according to Wesley Hersche, an associate director of research with Arizona State University's Global Security Initiative. "These issues involve a complex interaction of factors, and we should be careful not to oversimplify things," Hersche wrote in April.
Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.

Freshman Rep. Moira Jayne Walsh, 27, who has been outspoken about what she sees as a culture of corruption in the State House, lost her party's endorsement to Michael Earnheart, who voted for President Donald Trump. As a safe blue state, Rhode Island rarely gets any national political attention. But Walsh woke up Tuesday to donations from as far away as Texas and California. Party officials describe Earnheart as a "lifelong Democrat" who voted for Trump because he didn’t like Hillary Clinton.
Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.

The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.
Arunkumar believed that it was critical to investigate quickly. He asked the team to hand-deliver the patient's cerebrospinal fluid, blood, urine and throat swabs to his lab.

Jayasree accompanied a team of local epidemiologists to the family's home in Changaroth.
Hamilton, the Republican state lawmaker who beat the incumbent Karnes, won with a mix of support from teachers and other unions. While Karnes sparred with teachers during the strike, Hamilton took a moderate position. He aligned with teachers unions by opposing state right-to-work legislation and the proposed repeal of prevailing wage laws for public construction projects. The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.
The first, Antonio Halili, was the mayor of the much larger Tanauan City, south of Manila. Unlike Bote, Halili had developed both a reputation for having a heavy hand against drug traffickers and negotiating with them. Halili appeared on a more recent Duterte list of elected officials with ties to drug trafficking in 2017. Shortly after Halili’s assassination, Duterte told reporters, “I don’t know who killed him, but I told you don’t [engage in illegal drugs]. … His procession of drug suspects was just a front.”
Prior to this accusation, however, Halili had established a “walk of shame” program where he paraded drug suspects around his city for the public to jeer, leading others in the government to suggest he was killed by drug traffickers in revenge for humiliating their peers.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

The rally began with the prayer group’s permitted march from Portland’s Terry Schrunk Federal Plaza. The event was organized by activist Joey Gibson, a U.S. Senate candidate for Washington and leader of Patriot Prayer. The AntiFa group organized some distance away but not before police seized weapons such as utility knives, clubs and chemical sprays, according to The Oregonian. Despite the confiscations, the AntiFa group initiated hostilities by throwing eggs, bottles, and other items at the Patriot group, the paper noted.

Nearly 600 more retail jobs are to go in the UK as the Jacques Vert, Windsmoor and Precis department store brands are wound down by administrators. Administrators said they had failed to find a buyer for Calvetron Brands, which had been restructured following a rescue deal last summer. The business entered administration in May and had already shed more than 400 jobs before Wednesday’s announcement. The latest retail job losses come as more than 30,000 jobs are at risk in the UK following mass closure announcements by major chains including House of Fraser, New Look and Marks & Spencer. Retailers are suffering from rising costs and the switch to online shopping just as hard-pressed consumers rein in spending.

Because it is also a flood plain, the project’s 989,000 solar panels will be mounted on frames 12ft tall – the height of a double-decker bus. Unlike most solar farms, Cleve Hill Solar Park’s panels will not all face south, but east and west in a continuous zig-zag. The effect, say the scheme’s opponents, will be to turn green meadows into something resembling a colossal factory roof. Economically and environmentally the scheme makes no sense whatsoever. Apart from ruining a huge swathe of countryside and killing or displacing all the local wildlife, it will do little for Britain’s energy needs.
The economy has added an average 207,000 jobs a month this year after a blowout number of 223,000 in May. Economists predict that 195,000 jobs were added in June. Unemployment stands at 3.8%, the lowest rate since 2000. If it dips to 3.7%, it will be the lowest since 1969.
Russian forces loyal to dictator Bashar al-Assad killed the son of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the chief of the crumbling Islamic State, while he was hiding in a cave in Syria, Iraqi intelligence agents claimed Thursday. This week’s death of Hudhayfah al-Badri potentially deprives Baghdadi of an heir. Although they do not agree on the circumstances surrounding his death, Iraqi intelligence and Islamic State have confirmed that Hudhayfah al-Badri, Baghdadi’s son, is indeed dead. “The U.S. military said it had seen the reports of al-Badri’s death but declined any confirmation,” Voice of America conceded on Wednesday. Islamic State’s feeble presence in Iraq and Syria, once home to its now annihilated so-called caliphate, has been squeezed into ever-shrinking pockets of territory mainly located along the border dividing the two countries.
"Jon's record is clear—if it's good for Montana, Jon works with anyone from either party to get things done. If it's bad for Montana, he'll stand up to anyone," Tester spokesman Chris Meagher said. "East Coast developer Matt Rosendale is only looking out for himself and whatever out-of-state special interest group that is propping up his campaign with cash. We can't trust him to defend Montana." But before Trump arrived in Montana, Tester's campaign took out full-page ads in newspapers across the state, highlighting bills the senator sponsored that Trump has signed into law.

ZTE is far from alone. China assembles some 90 percent of the world's smartphones, computers and other electronics. But most of the revenue flows to American companies that supply computer chips and other technology.

What Washington welcomes as a source of well-paid jobs, Chinese leaders consider a dangerous dependence.

WASHINGTON – If it's a holiday, it must be time for President Donald Trump to hit the golf course. Right on schedule, the presidential motorcade arrived at the Trump National Golf Club in suburban Virginia in the late morning, the middle of a day that also has the president tweeting and hosting a military-themed picnic later at the White House. As he departed the presidential mansion in the morning, Trump took to Twitter. In addition to a general salutation – "Happy Fourth of July....Our Country is doing GREAT!"

A helicopter trip to a hospital may not be the only shock a patient faces after a bad accident. The next one could hit when the bill arrives. Rides in so-called air ambulances can lead to bills of more than $20,000 depending on a person's coverage, and insurance experts say big invoices are becoming more common as costs rise and coverage shifts. Air ambulances transport around 400,000 people each year in the U.S., according to industry estimates. Most trips are from one hospital to another.
Health policy experts say one flaw with the administration’s plan is the lack of any serious follow through. | REUTERS Drugmakers defy Trump's call to drop prices
President Donald Trump in May said that drugmakers would soon announce “massive” price cuts, and his administration rolled out a plan to bring down the cost of medicines. But the companies don’t appear to have gotten that message. Bayer raised the price of two cancer drugs by hundreds of dollars in May and Novartis followed by boosting four pricey treatments in June. Pfizer, one of the largest U.S. pharmaceutical companies, announced increases on more than 41 products this week.

The major U.S. stock indexes were mostly higher in early trading Friday following a solid jobs report, keeping the market on track for a weekly gain after two weeks of losses. The modest gains came despite an escalation in global trade tensions as the U.S. imposed tariffs on billions in Chinese goods and China responded in kind. Health care stocks posted the biggest gains, led by Biogen. The drugmaker's stock soared 18 percent to $353.28 on encouraging results from an Alzheimer's therapy. Industrials companies took some of the biggest losses.
— MINING: The EPA said last year that it won't require mining companies to prove they have the financial resources to clean up pollution, an Obama-era rule stemming from a long history of pollution spilling from abandoned mines into streams. Pruitt said modern mining practices and existing regulations made the financial requirement unnecessary and a burden on mining. — AUTOS: Pruitt's EPA has proposed freezing vehicle fuel-efficiency standards at 2020 levels for the next five years, according to a draft of the proposal obtained by Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del. For new vehicles, that means an average of about 30 miles per gallon instead of rising to 36 mpg by 2025 as Obama's EPA proposed. — OIL AND GAS: More than a dozen states are suing the EPA for failing to take action against leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, from oil and natural gas wells.
The problem is so pervasive that a lawmaker recently asked El Salvador's Legislative Assembly for national identity cards to be issued without addresses "to save lives." Fifteen years ago, the Salvadoran government began a crackdown on gangs, resulting in thousands of members being imprisoned. Yet they continued to proliferate, even running operations with cell phones from behind bars. El Salvador's defense minister said in 2015 there were 60,000 gang members in the country, compared to a combined police and army strength of 50,000. Members of those security forces contribute to the violence that is causing the northward migration.

The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.
"Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb.

Montana's voters may also vote on a measure to extend their existing expansion which is set to expire in 2019. So far, 34 states have approved expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.

Any amount of prescription opioid use was correlated with greater involvement. Among people with prescription opioid use disorder, nearly 20 percent had criminal justice involvement. For heroin users, it was 40 percent. "People who use opioids, including heroin, were up to 13 times more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system," says Winkelman. The study shows the complexity of the the opioid crisis, according to Josiah Rich, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Brown University, who wasn't involved in the research.

Trump has so far announced $34bn (£25.6bn) tariffs on Chinese imports, which alongside retaliatory measures from Beijing are due to come into force on Friday. His administration has already raised the level of import tariffs on steel and aluminium for several countries, including those from the EU as well as Canada and Mexico, with retaliation including higher EU taxes on whiskey, Levi’s jeans and Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Alongside the threat of higher taxes on European cars, Carney said the US would have the highest import tariff regime for more than half a century.
The strategy reprises last year's successful approach to confirming Justice Neil Gorsuch in the early spring of 2017. Gorsuch was named to fill the vacancy left by the death of Antonin Scalia and then kept open by the refusal of the Senate's Republican majority to consider Merrick Garland, the replacement named by President Barack Obama in 2016. Gorsuch was greeted with delight by abortion opponents, even though he had not ruled directly on Roe in his judicial career. But his confirmation was far from a sure thing because two Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, were seen as defenders of abortion rights.

So then, as now, the president said he wasn't even going to bring up the case he had promised would be overturned "automatically" by the justices he would name as president.
The term might provide only “a very, very modest preview” of waves of conservative rulings to come, however, because a locked-down conservative majority would likely inspire rightwing activists to bring increasingly aggressive cases, said Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. “It’s not just that justice Kennedy’s successor is likely going to move the court to the right,” Vladeck said. “It’s that knowing that there are five conservative justices surely emboldens states and conservative interest groups to bring to the supreme court legal theories that they might have been reluctant to leave in justice Kennedy’s hands.”

If that picture of the country’s jurisprudential future has left liberals distraught, it has also raised questions about the court’s increasingly politicized nature, its power to shape society and the erosion of its independence as one branch of government meant to balance the other two – Congress and the presidency – and to be checked in turn itself. While past courts have had liberal or conservative bents, since the Bush v Gore decision that decided the 2000 election, the court has taken on a more explicitly political feel. “People say the founders would roll over in their graves – I think the founders would hang themselves”, said Mickey Edwards, vice-president of the Aspen Institute think-tank and formerly a congressman for 16 years.

In one case, Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion that illegal immigrants do not have the same bargaining rights as American citizens and legal workers. “… an illegal immigrant worker is not an ’employee’ under the NLRA for the simple reason that, ever since 1986, an illegal immigrant worker is not a lawful ’employee’ in the United States,” Kavanaugh wrote. In another case, Kavanaugh noted that American multi-national corporations do not have the right to import foreign workers. The Circuit judge explained, “Under the provision of the immigration laws at issue here, mere economic expediency does not authorize an employer to displace American workers for foreign workers.”
Prominent conservative Ann Coulter has also called for Trump to nominate Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, arguing that other judges such as Thomas Hardiman and Raymond Kethledge “are open borders zealots.”

Nebraska May Join Utah, Idaho in Putting Medicaid Expansion Before Voters
Enlarge this image toggle caption Fred Knapp/NET News Fred Knapp/NET News
Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.
Pete Rickets questions that guarantee and has said many times that he opposes Medicaid expansion on fiscal grounds. "We cannot trust the Federal Government's long-term financial commitment to state programs," Ricketts wrote in a column on his website. And opponents argue even the 10 percent state share of the cost could threaten other spending priorities, like education and roads. Ricketts said at a press conference Thursday he's concerned about shifting Medicaid's focus from "the people who are truly vulnerable." He suggested the Medicaid expansion population's needs can be addressed "through the private sector, by creating jobs that have those types of benefits."

Previous winners have told the Guardian how much difference it has made to their working lives. “I think it gave an extra boost to our performance because people worked even harder to show the impact they could have by engaging families differently,” said Sue Williams, director of family safeguarding at Hertfordshire county council, which won the care award last year and was named the overall winner of the night. “Almost every public authority wanted to come and visit us to see what we’ve done and to share our work with them.”
Williams said winning the award made every staff member, from the team administrator to senior managers, “absolutely ecstatic”. Nominate your 2018 public servant of the year Read more

"What I can tell you is we're continuing to make progress." Others are a bit less upbeat about this next round of talks. "Pompeo's going into Pyongyang with a very difficult task," says Abraham Denmark, Asia program director at the Wilson Center. A senior Pentagon official during the Obama administration, Denmark worries that with President Trump's suspension of a major military exercise with South Korea next month, North Korea's already gotten a lot and given up very little. "Kim Jong Un did not make any new commitments in Singapore, and so the secretary of state is now forced to go into Pyongyang, trying to secure something that the president was not able to," says Denmark.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report says Democrats are "likely" to carry Montana in the Senate race. Inside Elections rates the contest as one that "tilts Democratic." After the rally, the spokesman for Tester's re-election campaign put out a statement that was critical of Rosendale but which did not mention the president. "Jon's record is clear—if it's good for Montana, Jon works with anyone from either party to get things done. If it's bad for Montana, he'll stand up to anyone," Tester spokesman Chris Meagher said.
Fox News again dominated for the second quarter of 2018 not only in cable news, but in all of cable, while CNN landed in last place by a country mile. For the eighth straight quarter, Fox was the most-watched network in all of cable. With an average of 1.409 million total day viewers, Fox attracted nearly as many eyeballs as MSNBC and CNN combined. MSNBC averaged just 930,000 viewers, while CNN nosedived with an average of just 658,000. During primetime, Fox snagged an average of 2.447 million viewers, compared to MSNBC’s 1.736 million.

President Trump had suggested lifting the prohibition, which environmentalists charge would raise levels of ground ozone during warmer months, during his campaign for the White House. Following the news of Mr. Pruitt’s resignation, Mr. Dinneen wrote that there was a “collective sigh of relief coming from the Midwest,” calling the 2019 ethanol quotas “the straw that broke the camel’s back.”
While it is too early to say how the handling of waivers or the treatment of E15 may change under new leadership, one indicator was small losses in affected refiners in early Friday trading and gains in most ethanol producers. CVR Refining, Andeavor and Delek U.S. Holdings , all of which benefited from waivers granted by the EPA, had rallied by 136%, 40% and 92% in the year ended Thursday, respectively. Ethanol companies Pacific Ethanol and Green Plains had fallen by 60% and 14%, respectively. Agricultural lobbyists often portray any easing of the rules as a sop to “big oil,” but that isn’t accurate.
Lyft, like Uber, is moving beyond cars. The ride-hailing startup on Monday announced it will acquire Motivate, the largest bikeshare operator in North America. Motivate operates Citi Bike in New York and Capital Bikeshare in Washington DC, among other brands. The move comes as Lyft has been expanding its reach in the transportation space. It has integrated public transit in its app and introduced Lyft Line, which lets users share a ride with strangers who are going to destinations close together.
National Guardsmen assigned to Operation Guardian Support rescued a Border Patrol K-9 agent and saved the animal’s life. The K-9 and his handler tracked down a group of 11 illegal immigrants before the dog fell victim to the heat. Members of a National Guard helicopter crew responded to a call for assistance from a Border Patrol team after a K-9 agent experienced a heat-related medical emergency. The K-9 became overheated while tracking a group of 11 illegal aliens in the desert and harsh terrain near Arivaca, Arizona, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials. Agents in the field contacted the Tucson Sector’s Tactical Operation Center and reported that a K-9 agent became overheated.

Illustration: HuffPost; Photos: Reuters Ieshia Evans is detained by law enforcement as she protests the shooting death of Alton Sterling near the headquarters of the Baton Rouge Police Department in Louisiana, U.S. July 9, 2016. As she sat cloistered inside her Baton Rouge jail cell on a July afternoon in 2016, Ieshia Evans initially had no clue she’d become an icon. As she remembers, food and sleep were the only things on her mind in the 24 hours she spent incarcerated. Evans had traveled from her home in New York City to Louisiana to protest against police brutality and the killing of Alton Sterling, an unarmed black man shot to death by Baton Rouge police. As thousands gathered in Baton Rouge for the July 9 protests, Evans walked into the middle of the street to oppose an advancing row of officers in riot gear.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.

The carmaker's warning of the dangers of tit-for-tat tariffs was just one of many. German lighting manufacturer Osram Licht's shares plunged 22 percent Thursday after it announced a weaker outlook due to trade tensions. Even hoteliers are starting to fret. Radisson Hospitality CEO John Kidd said the tariff dispute could depress business travel to China. Trump has made wooing foreign companies to expand U.S. manufacturing a priority, deeming it evidence that he's making good on promises to restore economic vitality to struggling regions.
Focusing much-needed attention on the South Side does not give the city a license to ignore other struggling neighborhoods. Three years ago, when UIC and the University of Chicago were both engaged in aggressive campaigns to woo the presidential center to their neighborhoods, things got a little testy. People forgot that although there were two separate bids from Chicago, the South Side and the West Side were playing for the same team. Everyone took a deep breath and thought about the alternative — losing the center to either New York or Hawaii. So in a striking show of unity, the two universities came together for a community breakfast designed to send a message to Obama.
What has the government said? Mr Javid called on Russia to explain "exactly what has gone on", adding: "We will stand up to the actions that threaten our security." The home secretary said he was "comfortable" the "exact same nerve agent" had been used in both the Salisbury and Amesbury poisonings - but added it was not yet known if they were from the same batch. In response to Mr Javid's comments, Russia said the British government was subjecting them "to hell". Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova urged police not to be led by the "dirty political game" and said she was confident London would have to apologise to Russia.

Now liberals are anguishing about the potential reversal of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion nationwide. Three Republican senators – Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Susan Collins of Maine – have indicated they will not vote for a Supreme Court nominee who suggests he or she might not respect the precedent of earlier rulings allowing abortion. Moreover, Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona has not shown up in the Senate since last year because he is being treated for brain cancer, and cannot be counted on to be able to cast a vote. With the GOP having but a two-vote advantage in the Senate, the path is narrow. Still, there is little question that the court will likely soon move to the right, and there is little Democrats can do about it.

A new USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll about patriotism, pegged to this week's celebration of the Fourth of July, finds an overwhelming majority of those surveyed — 90 percent — say they are proud to be Americans. But they split almost down the middle, 42 percent to 39 percent, when asked whether they are proud of America right now. Not surprisingly, the split was along partisan lines: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. There was bipartisan agreement on one thing: Across party lines, roughly seven in 10 agree with the statement, "I feel fatigued watching the news." Elsewhere in politics

“I would hope that it will disappear from the list of add-ons that many clinics have both in the UK and in New Zealand and Australia.”
Stuart Lavery, a consultant gynaecologist at Hammersmith Hospital who was not involved in the study, said women who have recurrent implantation failure are hard to treat. “This mini-trauma offered a real potentially exciting way forward and it has become very widely adopted in international practice and in UK practice,” he said. “Now somebody has been brave enough to do a large randomised control trail and shown it has no benefit.”
Lavery added that he expects practice to change. “I don’t think people will necessarily stop doing scratches, because it is one trial that adds to the literature, but I think people might now pause and really consider whether this might be something [helpful] for patients” he said, noting the procedure is painful. Nick Macklon, medical director at London Women’s Clinic, said in light of the new study endometrial scratching had probably been overused.
They are to consult on detailed plans to restrict the promotion and marketing of foods high in salt, sugar and fat.

“There are thousands and thousands of people in this city who want to support him, so that he can win battles,” said Liat Olenick, 32, a member of the liberal group Indivisible’s Brooklyn chapter who spent months directing personal appeals at Schumer to schedule the event. “But he’s not speaking to those people, and we want him to do that.”
During his remarks to constituents on the phone, Schumer tried to energize the Democratic faithful with a play for unity. The Democratic path to victory, he explained, is successfully making the case that Trump’s still-unnamed Supreme Court pick would roll back Roe v. Wade and Obamacare. Schumer also asked activists to spend less time prodding Democrats to use their limited procedural power to delay a Supreme Court confirmation. Republicans last year did away with the filibuster for high court nominees.
Scott Pruitt has resigned as head of the Environmental Protection Agency after a string of controversies involving his leadership, President Trump announced Thursday on Twitter. "Within the Agency Scott has done an outstanding job, and I will always be thankful to him for this," tweeted Trump, who added that EPA Deputy Administrator Andrew Wheeler would take over as acting administrator effective Monday. "I have no doubt that Andy will continue on with our great and lasting EPA agenda," Trump concluded. "We have made tremendous progress and the future of the EPA is very bright!" In his resignation letter to Trump, Pruitt said: "It is extremely difficult for me to cease serving you in this role first because I count it a blessing to be serving you in any capacity, but also, because of the transformative work that is occurring.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.

She said she believed it would be inappropriate to ask a nominee how they would vote on a future case. But she emphasized that they had to talk about precedent. In her view, Roe v.

"A number of judges (have told me) that good judges are always unhappy with some of their decisions but they make the right call regardless of their personal views.
They include the United States withdrawing its 28,500 troops in South Korea, ending its military drills with South Korea and stop bringing in strategic assets such as aircraft carriers and nuclear-capable bombers. North Korea hasn't repeated such specific demands since entering disarmament talks earlier this year, raising optimism that the country truly appeared to seek to improve ties with the United States. After the summit, Trump suspended annual military training with South Korea that the North has called an invasion rehearsal. But North Korea still prefers a step-by-step disarmament process with reciprocal concessions and benefits from the United States for each of the North's denuclearization steps. The ultimate rewards North Korea wants range from the easing or lifting of American-led international sanctions, the signing of a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, the establishment of diplomatic ties and the pulling out of U.S. troops in South Korea, experts say.
3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.

About nine hours earlier, another 14-year-old boy was shot in the Loop. He was coming up stairs at the corner of Wabash Avenue and Wacker Drive when he was shot in the leg Friday evening, police said.

XI ASSERTS TERRITORIAL CLAIMS IN MEETING WITH US DEFENSE SECRETARY
Chinese President Xi Jinping strongly asserted China's determination to defend territory it claims, including in the South China Sea, in a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. While the tone of Mattis' visit to Beijing was largely upbeat, Xi made sure to reinforce his reputation as a fervent nationalist when it comes to issues of sovereignty. Though Xi gave no specifics in his statement, he was largely seen as indicating the South China Sea as well as self-governing Taiwan. China also claims territory held by India and uninhabited East China Sea islands controlled by Japan.
Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.
The problem is so pervasive that a lawmaker recently asked El Salvador's Legislative Assembly for national identity cards to be issued without addresses "to save lives." Fifteen years ago, the Salvadoran government began a crackdown on gangs, resulting in thousands of members being imprisoned. Yet they continued to proliferate, even running operations with cell phones from behind bars. El Salvador's defense minister said in 2015 there were 60,000 gang members in the country, compared to a combined police and army strength of 50,000. Members of those security forces contribute to the violence that is causing the northward migration.

The University of Missouri is still facing enrollment and budgetary problems, including a $49 million budget shortfall, as a result of the 2015 social justice protests that caught national media attention. Many people remember the high-pitched yell of former University of Missouri professor Melissa Click. Click found herself at the center of weeks of unrest at the University of Missouri in 2015 and 2016. Click rose to infamy after a video of her calling for a student photojournalist to be physically removed from campus simply because he was documenting the protests. The protests involved accusations by students that the administration had mishandled several alleged racial issues on campus.

Russian forces loyal to dictator Bashar al-Assad killed the son of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the chief of the crumbling Islamic State, while he was hiding in a cave in Syria, Iraqi intelligence agents claimed Thursday. This week’s death of Hudhayfah al-Badri potentially deprives Baghdadi of an heir. Although they do not agree on the circumstances surrounding his death, Iraqi intelligence and Islamic State have confirmed that Hudhayfah al-Badri, Baghdadi’s son, is indeed dead. “The U.S. military said it had seen the reports of al-Badri’s death but declined any confirmation,” Voice of America conceded on Wednesday. Islamic State’s feeble presence in Iraq and Syria, once home to its now annihilated so-called caliphate, has been squeezed into ever-shrinking pockets of territory mainly located along the border dividing the two countries.
Any amount of prescription opioid use was correlated with greater involvement. Among people with prescription opioid use disorder, nearly 20 percent had criminal justice involvement. For heroin users, it was 40 percent. "People who use opioids, including heroin, were up to 13 times more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system," says Winkelman. The study shows the complexity of the the opioid crisis, according to Josiah Rich, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Brown University, who wasn't involved in the research.

As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
“[It] is exactly the same as when you surf on the Internet at home,” May Sun declared. “You still don’t have access to what is blocked by the Great Firewall.”
In a statement, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) called China Mobile an “unacceptable risk.”
“Granting the authorization poses an unacceptable risk to U.S. national security and law enforcement,” NTIA proclaimed. “This assessment rests in large part on China’s record of intelligence activities and economic espionage targeting the United States, along with China Mobile’s size and technical and financial resources.”
Last month, it was reported that over 20 venture capital firms in Silicon Valley have “close ties” to the Chinese government, while this year, Chinese phone manufacturer Huawei was identified as a security risk. In June, it was revealed that Congress was investigating Huawei, and in February, the heads of six major intelligence agencies warned Americans against using Huawei and ZTE phones.

NEW YORK — House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) has referred 15 individuals, including longtime Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal, for possible “open setting” testimony in the ongoing Russia investigation. The list was sent to House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA). Many of the names are tied to the discredited anti-Trump dossier produced by the controversial Fusion GPS firm, which was paid for its dossier work by both Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) via the Perkins Coie lawfirm. Indeed, Perkins Coie attorney Marc E. Elias, who reportedly was involved in arranging the payments that resulted in the dossier, made the Nunes list. As did Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson.
“I think the relationship will be a very good one,” the US president said of the Mexican politician, whose swearing-in will be in December. “We talked about trade, we talked about Nafta, we talked about a separate deal, just Mexico and the United States.”
Such restraint contrasted with Trump’s call to López Obrador’s predecessor, weeks after his inauguration last year. During that call, Trump told Enrique Peña Nieto that the US military would take care of “bad hombres” south of the border. López Obrador, or Amlo as he is best known, romped to a historic landslide victory on Sunday night, capitalising on public frustration at soaring crime rates and corruption with a promise to drain Mexico’s very own swamp. Indeed, some see similarities between the two men.

For new vehicles, that means an average of about 30 miles per gallon instead of rising to 36 mpg by 2025 as Obama's EPA proposed. — OIL AND GAS: More than a dozen states are suing the EPA for failing to take action against leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, from oil and natural gas wells. Last year, a federal appeals court ruled that Pruitt overstepped his authority in trying to stall an Obama-era rule requiring companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks. — AGRICULTURE: In March 2017, a month after becoming EPA administrator, Pruitt delayed consideration of banning usage of a widely used pesticide, chlorpyrifos, on food crops for at least five years. The pesticide has been banned for household use since 2001, but agriculture groups want to keep using it.
Average attendance for the Fourth of July is 20,000 to 25,000 people, he added. The park service also was taking a closer look at the statue to see if there was any damage, though that's unlikely, Willis said. The copper-pounded skin is only the thickness of two pennies but "it's strong," he said. "That statue has been out in the middle of New York Harbor for 130 years — with hurricanes and lightning and everything that nature has thrown at her," he said.
Meanwhile, other media personalities have faced kidnappings, arrests and physical abuse by mysterious hooded men who no journalist dare name - but every journalist in the country is convinced belong to the military intelligence agencies. But after maintaining months of silence as to what it has endured, or what exactly the military's complaints are, Dawn recently published a frank and stinging editorial. The editorial describes its important, factual reporting about the serious rift between civil and military authorities during the Nawaz Sharif government, which had infuriated the military, and Dawn's insistence on protecting the sources for its stories - a basic element of media ethics worldwide. The editorial states that "a campaign of disinformation, libel and slander, hate and virtual incitement to violence against Dawn and its staff has necessitated placing certain matters on record". It added that elements "within or sections of the state" are not upholding constitutional freedoms.

There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void. In New Jersey, this is compounded by the fact that the state is located between two big cities, New York and Philadelphia, that are in other states. The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
Michael Avenatti told POLITICO that he's being targeted over his political views. | Seth Wenig/AP Photo Feds target Avenatti over old firm's unpaid taxes U.S. Attorney accuses Trump critic of 'misrepresentations' and 'misconduct.' U.S. Government lawyers are slamming one of President Donald Trump's most prominent critics, attorney Michael Avenatti, over nearly half a million dollars in unpaid federal taxes owed by his former firm. Avenatti's former law firm, Eagan Avenatti LLP, agreed to make the roughly $452,000 tax payment last month in order to resolve a bankruptcy case, but the funds never arrived at the IRS, according to a filing Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, Calif.

Corporate America couldn’t hire Republican lobbyists fast enough after President Donald Trump’s election gave the GOP unified control of Washington. Now there are signs that Democrats are back in demand. Companies and trade groups are trying to hire congressional staffers with ties to influential House Democrats four months ahead of the midterm elections, in which Democrats are expected to pick up seats and potentially retake control of the House. Lobbyists are helping their clients meet with the Democrats who would become committee chairs if the party does win back the chamber. And trade groups are talking to members about what to expect from a Democratic takeover.
U.S. Treasuries and German Bund both saw buying while E-Mini futures for Wall Street’s S&P 500 ESc1 followed Europe and Asia’s lead with a loss of 0.5 percent.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS fell 0.6 percent, adding to a 2 percent drop last week. Japan's Nikkei .N225 shed 2.2 percent to an 11-week low, with a survey of manufacturers showing sentiment had darkened a shade in the face of trade war threats. The purchasing managers’ index (PMI) still edged higher for June, but exports orders softened.

Our Founding Fathers resolved that without freedom Americans could not enjoy life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. To secure it, they fought a war to break free from the bonds of tyranny. It isn’t a faraway tyrant that oppresses us today. Rather, we are in the grip of a new kind of tyranny — that of mistrust. This tyrant sits on a throne in our minds and is just as cruel as King George was during the time of the Founders.
Can a carbon tax save the GOP? Climate change is one of many issues that divides the Republican Party. Like racial resentment, climate denial is a position held mostly by old, white, male conservatives. There’s a climate change generational, ethnic, and gender gap. 61% of Republicans under the age of 50 support government climate policies, compared to just 44% of Republicans over 50.
Barnes & Noble fired Chief Executive Officer Demos Parneros and said he would be leaving his position without receiving severance. The ouster of Perneros is "not due to any disagreement with the company regarding its financial reporting, policies or practices or any potential fraud," the retailer said in a statement Tuesday.

The company will search for a new CEO with a leadership group appointed to fill the management void until a replacement is found, including CFO Allen Lindstrom and Tim Mantel, the company's chief merchandising officer, the bookseller said. Leonard Riggio is still executive chairman.

The list of Democrats expressing frustration with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has been growing longer in recent weeks, but don’t expect to see former President Barack Obama’s name on it. At a party fundraising event Friday afternoon in Northern California, Obama spoke highly of Pelosi – and even predicted that she will return to the job of House speaker after November’s midterm elections. “I think everybody knows how much I love Nancy Pelosi,” Obama told the gathering at a home in affluent Atherton, Politico reported. "Nancy, I believe, is one of the greatest speakers we ever had, and will once again be one of the greatest speakers we ever have after we get through this cycle," he continued. “And there's not much I could have gotten done without having Nancy there alongside of me every step of the way.”

3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.

"I really have been pleasantly surprised how willing he is to tell Chuck Schumer to go fly a kite," she added, referring to the Senate minority leader. At other times, however, Jones has taken up liberal positions seen as risky for a Democratic senator from a GOP state. He aligned himself with most of his Democratic colleagues against Gina Haspel, Trump's pick for CIA director, arguing that her record on enhanced interrogation techniques was unacceptable. And instead of focusing on a politically safe issue in his maiden Senate floor speech, Jones struck a nerve by calling for a dialogue on gun violence after the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida.
But reports suggest that the mood among some of her MPs has soured. It's not just in pre-election Bavaria that anti-migrant rhetoric has borne fruit.

Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.

Even Pruitt’s own staff had begun to sour on him, with many worrying that their future career prospects would be damaged by their association with Pruitt’s tenure. Each scandal seemed more damning than the last. Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.

Germany remains haunted by the Nazis' mass murder of Jews in 1933-1945. Ms Giffey, a centre-left Social Democrat (SPD) politician, said teachers needed more support to combat anti-Semitism, as the problem went beyond the classroom, involving parents and society at large. "So in the coming school year, as a first step, we will send 170 anti-bullying experts into selected schools in Germany, funded by the federal authorities," she told the daily Rheinische Post.

The NHS will consume 66% of the Welsh budget by 2048 if demand increases in line with predicted demand, according to new research. Health economist Prof Ceri Phillips said spending on the NHS would need to rise by 4% a year. Currently £6bn out of a total Welsh budget of £14.5bn goes to the NHS. The Welsh Government said its Health and Social Care Plan aimed to reduce demand through more people managing their own health and well-being. BBC Wales Investigates had asked Prof Phillips, from Swansea University, to question existing projections for healthcare in Wales and then calculate how much extra spending would be needed to keep the NHS afloat.
Disputes around the funding of continuing care have become a major industry. The recent NHS funding announcement, making no reference whatsoever to social care, evidenced the fact that the government still hasn’t the least idea of how the two are umbilically linked.

Began his career in environmental law at the EPA, as a special assistant in the agency's toxics office during President George H.W. Spent years playing various roles on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, which oversees the EPA, drafting regulations on chemical safety, air and water pollution and climate change — generally seeking to reduce government regulations on industries that generate greenhouse gases. Served as longtime aide to Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., whom you may recall from the 2015 floor speech in which he rebutted climate change science with a snowball. After leaving Congress, worked for years as a lobbyist for some of the largest coal, chemical and uranium companies in the U.S. — including the uranium mining firm that pushed for the reduction of Bears Ears National Monument, which is near one of its processing facilities.

“That is the magic of Europe,” she said. But Orbán promptly dismissed their idea of a more integrated Europe as a “nightmare”. Two weeks ago, Merkel finally responded to Macron and agreed to a small eurozone “fiscal capacity” – that is, a budget – as part of a much-anticipated attempt to relaunch the Franco-German relationship as a “motor” for the EU. But the Meseberg declaration was widely seen as a disappointment – the concessions that Merkel made will not do much to make the single currency sustainable. Yet even these concessions were immediately – and unsurprisingly – opposed by other northern European countries that are even more hostile to Macron’s vision than Germany.

Norway, the president wrote, "remains the only NATO ally sharing a border with Russia that lacks a credible plan to spend 2 percent of its gross domestic product on defense." Norway is far from alone as a target of criticism -- the president has reportedly sent similar letters to other countries. Of the 28 NATO nations, only three besides the U.S. spent the promised 2 percent of GDP on defense last year. Throughout his presidency, Mr. Trump has prodded NATO nations to spend more.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
You've got to look at every issue from all sides." "I really have been pleasantly surprised how willing he is to tell Chuck Schumer to go fly a kite," she added, referring to the Senate minority leader. At other times, however, Jones has taken up liberal positions seen as risky for a Democratic senator from a GOP state. He aligned himself with most of his Democratic colleagues against Gina Haspel, Trump's pick for CIA director, arguing that her record on enhanced interrogation techniques was unacceptable. And instead of focusing on a politically safe issue in his maiden Senate floor speech, Jones struck a nerve by calling for a dialogue on gun violence after the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida.
The proposal would:
Legalize the possession and sale of up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana for personal, recreational use for people over the age of 21. A person could keep up to 10 ounces of marijuana at home. Tax marijuana sales with a 10 percent excise tax at the retail level as well as the state's 6 percent sales tax. Split those revenues, with 35 percent going to K-12 education, 35 percent to roads, 15 percent to the communities that allow marijuana businesses in their communities and 15 percent to counties where marijuana business are located. Allow communities to decide whether they’ll allow marijuana businesses in their towns.
'We’re going to run different'
His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
He described “unbelievably bad border laws, immigration laws” in the United States, calling them “the weakest in the world, laughed at by everybody in the world.” He contrasted the U.S. immigration laws with “Mexico’s very strong immigration laws.”
Trump suggested that Mexico can help the United States “until we straighten out our immigration laws, which have been bad for many, many years, decades.” He further assured, “We’re gonna have them taken care of.”

Teenagers have been filmed sniffing an "unknown substance" on school grounds. Their school, Venerable Bede Church of England Academy in Sunderland, confirmed there had been an "incident" on Wednesday. Three pupils - two boys from Year 9 and one from Year 10 - had been excluded while the school investigated, it said. The video of the boys has been re-posted on Facebook and has had more than 28,000 views. Northumbria Police said the force had been "made aware of a video circulating on social media which appears to show two pupils taking an unknown substance".
This week the can hits the wall. Theresa May must present her Brussels negotiators with an agreed cabinet template for Brexit, or they, and she, will slither into chaos. She must end the intransigence of her rebel cabinet members, who must accept her leadership or go. Negotiators will on Friday present the cabinet with what was always the only sane option for a post-Brexit Britain – a version of the Norwegian model, of a single market within the EEA. The nation’s economy is too integrated with Europe to go back to walls and barriers.

David Shulkin, Veterans Affairs Secretary - 28 March 2018
A doctor, he had served as undersecretary of veterans affairs for health under Barack Obama. President Trump had hailed him as "fantastic" when appointing him, and the Senate gave him the only 100-0 confirmation of the Trump team.
That’s what’s happening in this industry,” he said. Numaya, who is also a member of Akita’s prefectural assembly, said Akita’s problems will eventually have a direct impact on Tokyo. “Children born and raised in the countryside move to Tokyo, produce, spend money and get the economy moving. That’s how things have worked since the era of Japan’s post-war economic growth,” he said. “But the countryside is losing ability to bear and raise children and provide them (to Tokyo) because of lower birth rates,” he added.

He said there was also a high sickness rate among officers and problems with staff retention. G4S, which currently runs five of the 14 privately-run jails in the UK, took over the management of the prison in 2011. It promised to "continue to invest" in Birmingham, which holds more than 1,400 inmates.

National Guardsmen assigned to Operation Guardian Support rescued a Border Patrol K-9 agent and saved the animal’s life. The K-9 and his handler tracked down a group of 11 illegal immigrants before the dog fell victim to the heat. Members of a National Guard helicopter crew responded to a call for assistance from a Border Patrol team after a K-9 agent experienced a heat-related medical emergency. The K-9 became overheated while tracking a group of 11 illegal aliens in the desert and harsh terrain near Arivaca, Arizona, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials. Agents in the field contacted the Tucson Sector’s Tactical Operation Center and reported that a K-9 agent became overheated.
Pentagon Questioned Over Blackout On War Zone Troop Numbers
Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images
For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.
It does create a lot of tension. Amazon represents both innovation and progress, and also dystopian fears for a lot of folks.”

The city council has struggled to find a path that remains true to Seattle’s progressive values while keeping the source of much of its recent prosperity happy. In 2015 it became the first major US city to increase its minimum wage to $15 an hour. Keenan-Lai said 100,000 people – then quarter of the working population of the city – benefited from the measure, but that its impact was swiftly eroded.

“The increase in the cost of housing has exceeded the increase in wages,” she said.
Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.
Health policy experts say one flaw with the administration’s plan is the lack of any serious follow through. | REUTERS Drugmakers defy Trump's call to drop prices
President Donald Trump in May said that drugmakers would soon announce “massive” price cuts, and his administration rolled out a plan to bring down the cost of medicines. But the companies don’t appear to have gotten that message. Bayer raised the price of two cancer drugs by hundreds of dollars in May and Novartis followed by boosting four pricey treatments in June. Pfizer, one of the largest U.S. pharmaceutical companies, announced increases on more than 41 products this week.
Trump said Sunday that he would "probably" not ask his Supreme Court pick how they would vote on the Roe v. Wade legal precedent during an interview with Fox News. But he added that abortion rights "could very well end up" being determined on a state-by-state basis after his pick is confirmed. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who beat a senior House Democrat from New York in a primary last week, called on Democrats to stiffen their backbone on the court fight. "The messaging isn't as clear to the communities that we're trying to represent," she said. "Are we fighting, or not?"

A writer for Slate magazine claimed:
Under the Trump administration, even naturalized citizens are now a target. The government agency that oversees immigration applications is hiring lawyers and immigration officers to review cases of immigrants suspected of obtaining citizenship through fake identities or other false information on their applications. Cases would be referred to the Department of Justice, where offenders could lose their citizenship or legal status.
"And he's said things that I didn't agree with, that I don't like, but it doesn't do an awful lot of good to just attack, attack, attack." WHAT VOTERS SAY BACK HOME
On the whole, Jones, who served as a U.S. attorney in the state during Bill Clinton's second term, is getting generally good reviews at home. According to an April Morning Consult poll, 47 percent of state voters said they approved of the job he was doing, while 25 percent said they disapproved. Twenty-eight percent said they didn't know or had no opinion. But at the Barons game, conservative Republican voters in attendance spoke up about their disappointment.
It has nothing to do with “basic human decency”, so it is far easier to scapegoat a junior producer than admit the program was working entirely as planned. A day later, the hosts issued an on-air apology, saying the senator had crossed a line and seeking to disassociate themselves from “unverified rumour and innuendo” about Hanson-Young’s private life. They had no such scruples during the interview, that went on for more than 17 minutes. It would be wrong to say this incident proves that Australia is struggling with the #MeToo movement and what it might mean, although it is. Australia has a blokey culture, and there is considerable backlash to revelations of the ubiquity of sexual harassment, whether low level or more serious.
“Having secure borders” gets a relatively high mean rating of 4.8 on a scale of one to seven. One is the worst; seven the best. But “welcoming immigrants and refugees” has a rating that was only a bit lower, at 4.3. Republicans are more likely to rate secure borders as a strong value; Democrats are more likely to rate welcoming immigrants and refugees as a strong value. In follow-up interviews, there was angst over the Trump administration policy, now modified, of separating children from their parents when they cross the border illegally.
President Trump has just said in the past week he's going to raise things like Syria, like Ukraine, like the election meddling issue, really the whole range of issues between us. And I think that, in the president's mind, this is very important, because it gives him an opportunity to size up Vladimir Putin, to see where there are areas where we might make progress together and where there are areas where we may not. BRENNAN: Well, right now, Russia is blanket-bombing Southern Syria. That violates the last agreement Vladimir Putin made with President Trump. Why would he believe that he's in any way trustworthy?
SAYANOGORSK, Russia—When the Trump administration blacklisted Russia’s biggest aluminum producer, United Co. Rusal, in April, it was among a blast of measures aimed at the country’s elite. But the sanctions are already weighing on the residents of this Siberian factory town more than 2,000 miles east of Moscow, where Rusal and its smelter anchor the local economy.
And that's quite a run. And it includes some of the biggest cases of the term, including upholding the travel ban and dealing a blow to public unions. So it's hard to - it's hard not to think that there's enough data there to say that Justice Kennedy sort of gave up on the liberal project even as he was giving up on the court. GROSS: So you wrote a fascinating article in The Times headlined "How Conservatives Weaponized The First Amendment," and that phrase is borrowed from Justice Elena Kagan's dissenting decision in the Supreme Court case involving public unions. Before we get to that case, give us a little overview of how it's become the right wing of the court that has been emphasizing the First Amendment in its decisions.

“I think he’s absolutely brilliant, with the right temperament,” McConnell told reporters over the weekend. But that political endorsement is backed up by many in the legal community who rave about Thapar. Louisville attorney Ned Pillersdorf, who calls himself a “Bernie Sanders Democrat,” told the Louisville Courier-Journal that Thapar is fair and judicial. “There are much, much worse Trump nominees they should go after...If I get to talk to Bernie, I’d say vote for him.” Thapar has shown he can be tough on both defendants and the government. He once sentenced a woman to 18 years in prison for assisting her jailed daughter to obtain drugs that killed her.

“He had a very excellent election that, I would say, even better than anticipated,” said President Trump, who told a story about years ago predicting Obrador’s election to the office of President in Mexico. “I told him a number of years ago when I saw him campaigning for a different race, frankly, a different year, a different race, I said he’ll be someday he’s going to be the President of Mexico. So he remembered that and it turned out to be correct.”
Trump tweeted congratulations to the Mexican President-elect late Sunday:
Congratulations to Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on becoming the next President of Mexico. I look very much forward to working with him. There is much to be done that will benefit both the United States and Mexico!

Thousands of people protested earlier Saturday against the the Trump administration's family separations and across the Columbia River in Vancouver, Washington. Hundreds of rallies were held nationwide to protest President Trump's "zero tolerance" immigration policy.

Even Pruitt’s own staff had begun to sour on him, with many worrying that their future career prospects would be damaged by their association with Pruitt’s tenure. Each scandal seemed more damning than the last. Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.

In his first loss — by a mere 0.56 percent to conservative Felipe Calderon in 2006 — his supporters held months-long protests in Mexico City and he referred to himself as "the legitimate president." His allies are warning even before Sunday's presidential vote that there better not be any funny business.

Three organisations - the Sex Worker Advocacy and Resistance Movement (Swarm), the English Collective of Prostitutes (ECP), and the xTalk collective - are planning a demonstration outside Parliament at the time of this Wednesday's debate to protest against the suggested law change.

Eric Young, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees’ Council of Prison Locals, now prays before he looks at his phone every morning, worried he’ll receive a message from BOP’s director notifying him of a staff death. Young estimates that around two-thirds of his union members were Trump supporters. That makes sense: It’s a law enforcement agency that leans white and male (72 percent male, 62 percent white), and many federal prisons are in rural parts of the country, which Trump dominated. But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau. BOP has long suffered the kind of problems you’d expect for a massive bureaucracy centered on caging tens of thousands of people.

The rally began with the prayer group’s permitted march from Portland’s Terry Schrunk Federal Plaza. The event was organized by activist Joey Gibson, a U.S. Senate candidate for Washington and leader of Patriot Prayer. The AntiFa group organized some distance away but not before police seized weapons such as utility knives, clubs and chemical sprays, according to The Oregonian. Despite the confiscations, the AntiFa group initiated hostilities by throwing eggs, bottles, and other items at the Patriot group, the paper noted.
The U.S. economy continues to show strength in the wake of tax reform and deregulation, but the downside of robust growth is that Donald Trump thinks this means he can dabble at trade war with impunity. He ought to look at the signs that growth would be even stronger if not for his border-tax brawls. The latest evidence came in the minutes released Thursday from the Federal Open Market Committee’s June meeting. Fed district presidents from around the U.S. reported evidence of strong growth, but along the way came this warning:

“However, many District contacts expressed concern about the possible adverse effects of tariffs and other proposed trade restrictions, both domestically and abroad, on future investment activity; contacts in some Districts indicated that plans for capital spending had been scaled back or postponed as a result of uncertainty over trade policy.”
The minutes continued: “Contacts in the steel and aluminum industries expected higher prices as a result of the tariffs on these products but had not planned any new investments to increase capacity. Conditions in the agricultural sector reportedly improved somewhat, but contacts were concerned about the effect of potentially higher tariffs on their exports.”
These reports are from the economy’s ground floor, not the Beltway penthouse.
"People who use opioids, including heroin, were up to 13 times more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system," says Winkelman. The study shows the complexity of the the opioid crisis, according to Josiah Rich, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Brown University, who wasn't involved in the research. It shows "the spectrum of the disease and its overlap with the criminal justice system, showing that the more you progress along that continuum, the more likely you are to get tangled up in the criminal justice system." The study also showed that most people with opioid use disorder had other mental illnesses and were also more likely to have certain chronic health conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The study authors argue for the need to engage and involve the criminal justice system in dealing with the opioid epidemic, including reducing overdose deaths.
This was particularly an issue for Pruitt’s former executive scheduler Sydney Hupp, who often had to shell out for Pruitt’s trips. Hupp was also asked by Pruitt to speak with staff at one of Trump’s hotels, believing he could get a deal on a second-hand mattress they were selling. Pruitt remained miserly even when he was abusing his position to get a good deal. He fell behind on the rental payments on the condo he was getting on the cheap and eventually had to be evicted and the locks were changed.
“If you’re going to be a priest, why not aspire to be the highest priest there is?” he told me.

Thomas mailed back reel-to-reel audio recordings recounting his travels.

It is Facebook’s second attempt at answering Congress’s queries. In June, Facebook delivered 450 pages of answers to two Senate committees, deflecting some questions about its influence and market power while offering some detail about the information it collects on users. Facebook has been under scrutiny since March when revelations surfaced that political analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, which aided President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, purchased data on 87 million users without their consent. In the ensuing hearings, lawmakers asked Mr. Zuckerberg whether Facebook was in violation of a settlement the company made in 2012 with the Federal Trade Commission, under which the company is required to give its users clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before sharing their information beyond their privacy settings.
The University of Missouri is still facing enrollment and budgetary problems, including a $49 million budget shortfall, as a result of the 2015 social justice protests that caught national media attention. Many people remember the high-pitched yell of former University of Missouri professor Melissa Click. Click found herself at the center of weeks of unrest at the University of Missouri in 2015 and 2016. Click rose to infamy after a video of her calling for a student photojournalist to be physically removed from campus simply because he was documenting the protests. The protests involved accusations by students that the administration had mishandled several alleged racial issues on campus.

"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.

GROSS: So it sounds like you vote in local elections but not necessarily in presidential elections. GROSS: And you seem to feel like whoever's in office - it doesn't make that big a difference, but do you perceive...
RILEY: No, that's not what I'm...
“What remains to be seen is whether the enthusiasm holds up in November.”
The president told Fox News that he believes his nominee will get some support from Democrats. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, an abortion rights supporter, is considered one of the key votes on a nominee. She said she wouldn't vote for someone who would overturn Roe v. Wade. "A candidate who would overturn Roe would not be acceptable," she said Sunday on ABC's This Week. Collins, who has previously bucked party lines on other key issues such as health care, said she plans to have an in-depth conversation with the nominee.
BREAKING: @NEAToday President @Lily_NEA reacts to radical ruling by #SCOTUS: "We are living in a system that is rigged to benefit special interests & billionaires, all at the expense of working people."

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.
Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.
On this much police and activist South Side priest Michael Pfleger can agree: Saturday morning’s anti-violence march on the Dan Ryan Expressway is all about danger. Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.
As well as a new president, Mexican will be voting for 128 senators and 500 deputies in Congress as well as state and local officials. In all, 88 million people will be eligible to vote. Mexico is the second largest economy in Latin America and a major oil exporter. However, oil prices have dropped and the Mexican currency, the peso, has fallen sharply against the dollar. More than 40% of the population lives in poverty and high levels of corruption and violence have led some companies to pull out of the worst affected areas.
In Delaware, Students (And Parents) Can Soon Choose Their Race And Gender At School

When Shyaira Dineen was in first grade, a teacher of hers told her to mark her race as African-American on a standardized test. Dineen remembers that day clearly because she says it confused her. She has a black mother and a white father. "I didn't argue with her," says the 23-year-old, but she did think it was weird. "Why do I feel like I only have to choose one?
Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson said Monday she was particularly pleased that this past weekend there were no violent incidents, and she said she thinks that is a more typical weekend in Gary. “These are very unsettling times for all of us in the city,” the mayor said. “We don’t want to ignore our situation, but we should also admit this past weekend (in Gary) was an aberration.”
Pleased with the Common Council’s action was Eakta Kamal, a Munster resident with an interest in gun control issues. “It hits very close to home for us in Gary,” Kamal said. “I think it’s a common sense solution to think that people ought to think our lives are more important than the concerns of a gun owner.”
For Kamal, gun violence is a first-hand experience, as she lost her right arm after being shot while working in a store, she said.
Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left a demoralized agency where staff fear their ability to protect public health is diminished
Scott Pruitt is out but his impact on the environment will be felt for years
Scott Pruitt, who has finally stepped down as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency after a long-rumbling corruption scandal, rose to public prominence on the back of a series of increasingly outlandish ethical controversies. Scott Pruitt resigns: Trump's scandal-ridden EPA chief steps down Read more
From lobbying fast food company Chick-fil-A on behalf of his wife, to demanding his staff acquire a mattress from a Trump Hotel – not to mention the millions of taxpayer dollars spent on security, first-class travel and soundproof booths – Pruitt’s behavior clashed spectacularly with any pretense of Trump’s pledge to “drain the swamp” in Washington. But the lasting legacy of the former Oklahoma attorney general – who was picked by Trump after crusading against what he called the EPA’s “activist agenda” – is likely to be felt in the systematic weakening of environmental regulations. While not as eye-catching as, for example, his demand that his official vehicle use sirens so he could reach a French restaurant on time, Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left behind a demoralized agency where staff fret that their ability to protect public health has been diminished. A staunch ally of oil and gas companies, Pruitt stacked EPA advisory boards with industry representatives and sought to set aside whole troves of research that link pollution to various illnesses.
So we have 50 plus 200 plus almost 300.”
Analysts say tariffs are not the most effective way of putting pressure on China, which the US accuses of unfair trade practices and stealing intellectual property from US companies. Syracuse University economics professor Mary Lovely and researcher Yang Liang found 87% of electronics products to be levied by US tariffs came from multinationals and joint ventures rather than Chinese firms. China’s economy is no longer as dependent on exports. Domestic consumption now accounts for more than half of the country’s GDP. Exports to the US account for only 19% of all of China’s exports.
Infrastructure is supposed to knit us together as a nation, increasing our personal mobility and economic connectivity, but the politics of infrastructure is increasingly exposing our divides. ***
For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
Hamilton, the Republican state lawmaker who beat the incumbent Karnes, won with a mix of support from teachers and other unions. While Karnes sparred with teachers during the strike, Hamilton took a moderate position. He aligned with teachers unions by opposing state right-to-work legislation and the proposed repeal of prevailing wage laws for public construction projects. The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.
Pentagon Questioned Over Blackout On War Zone Troop Numbers
Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images
For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.
Fox News again dominated for the second quarter of 2018 not only in cable news, but in all of cable, while CNN landed in last place by a country mile. For the eighth straight quarter, Fox was the most-watched network in all of cable. With an average of 1.409 million total day viewers, Fox attracted nearly as many eyeballs as MSNBC and CNN combined. MSNBC averaged just 930,000 viewers, while CNN nosedived with an average of just 658,000. During primetime, Fox snagged an average of 2.447 million viewers, compared to MSNBC’s 1.736 million.

About four years ago, Dais had lined up a Chinese company to help develop its business in nanotechnology that helps produce clean water. Tangredi said the Chinese company persuaded a long-time Dais employee to defect with trade secrets. "They just stole it, and they are using it against us," he said. Tangredi said he hopes the threat of a trade war will force China to rethink its practices: "You've got to do something to get their attention."
The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.

'We’re going to run different'
His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
In 2014, as part of a training program initiated by the United State's Global Health Security Agenda the labs at the Manipal Center for Virus Research and the National Institute of Virology in Pune were prepared to identify outbreaks of Nipah. "That training really helped us," says Arunkumar. "I ruled out other causes of encephalitis and suspected it was Nipah right away." On the evening of May 18, less than 12 hours after he received the patient's tissue samples, his lab confirmed his suspicion. The very next day, M. Miriyam, the boy's aunt, died.
The proposal would:
Legalize the possession and sale of up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana for personal, recreational use for people over the age of 21. A person could keep up to 10 ounces of marijuana at home. Tax marijuana sales with a 10 percent excise tax at the retail level as well as the state's 6 percent sales tax. Split those revenues, with 35 percent going to K-12 education, 35 percent to roads, 15 percent to the communities that allow marijuana businesses in their communities and 15 percent to counties where marijuana business are located. Allow communities to decide whether they’ll allow marijuana businesses in their towns.
National Guardsmen assigned to Operation Guardian Support rescued a Border Patrol K-9 agent and saved the animal’s life. The K-9 and his handler tracked down a group of 11 illegal immigrants before the dog fell victim to the heat. Members of a National Guard helicopter crew responded to a call for assistance from a Border Patrol team after a K-9 agent experienced a heat-related medical emergency. The K-9 became overheated while tracking a group of 11 illegal aliens in the desert and harsh terrain near Arivaca, Arizona, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials. Agents in the field contacted the Tucson Sector’s Tactical Operation Center and reported that a K-9 agent became overheated.
Nebraska May Join Utah, Idaho in Putting Medicaid Expansion Before Voters
Enlarge this image toggle caption Fred Knapp/NET News Fred Knapp/NET News
Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.
In an 1873 interview with the Pike County Republican newspaper, Madison Hemings, thesecond son of Thomas Jefferson and his slave Sally Hemings, told a story. It was a story that would confirm the decades of rumors that had circulated since Jefferson ran for president in 1801. Madison Hemings began his recollection of his parent’s taboo relationship with these words:
"But during that time (in Paris) my mother became Mr. Jefferson's concubine, and when he was called back home she was [pregnant] by him. He desired to bring my mother back to Virginia with him, but she demurred.
Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
Abbott said on Tuesday night he never conceived of climate change as a moral challenge. “It was an issue, that’s all, and – at least on the actual changes we’ve so far seen – not a very significant one compared to man’s inhumanity to man; maintaining and improving living standards; and even to many other environmental issues such as degraded bush and waterways, particulate pollution, water quality in the third world, deforestation and urban overcrowding.”
He contended that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide from roughly 300 to 400 parts per million over the last century had not triggered “dramatic consequences”. Play Video 0:32 Andrew Probyn calls Tony Abbott 'destructive' in ABC report – video
“Storms are not more severe; droughts are not more prolonged; floods are not greater; and fires are not more intense than a century ago – despite hyperventilating reportage and over-the-top claims from Green politicians,” he said. “Sea levels have hardly risen and temperatures are still below those of the medieval warm period. Over time, temperature change seems to correlate rather more with sun spot activity than with carbon dioxide levels.
You can’t push any group of people that hard, that fast and for that long and expect them to maintain their composure.”
Eric Young, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees’ Council of Prison Locals, now prays before he looks at his phone every morning, worried he’ll receive a message from BOP’s director notifying him of a staff death. Young estimates that around two-thirds of his union members were Trump supporters. That makes sense: It’s a law enforcement agency that leans white and male (72 percent male, 62 percent white), and many federal prisons are in rural parts of the country, which Trump dominated. But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau. BOP has long suffered the kind of problems you’d expect for a massive bureaucracy centered on caging tens of thousands of people.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.

Shoko Asahara, the founder of the Japanese doomsday cult Aum Shinrikyo, which killed 13 people and injured hundreds more with sarin gas in Tokyo in 1995, was hanged on Friday along with six of his followers, the government said. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, Japan's government spokesman, confirmed the executions to The Associated Press and said authorities were taking precautions in case of any retaliation by his followers. Asahara, 63, whose real name was Chizuo Matsumoto, had been on death row since 2004, when he was convicted of multiple counts of murder after years of court battles.

WASHINGTON – If it's a holiday, it must be time for President Donald Trump to hit the golf course. Right on schedule, the presidential motorcade arrived at the Trump National Golf Club in suburban Virginia in the late morning, the middle of a day that also has the president tweeting and hosting a military-themed picnic later at the White House. As he departed the presidential mansion in the morning, Trump took to Twitter. In addition to a general salutation – "Happy Fourth of July....Our Country is doing GREAT!"
In the trench war between congressional Republicans and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, we have arrived at a crucial battle. A House resolution sets Friday as the deadline for the Justice Department to come clean on the beginning of its investigation into the Trump campaign. We’ll find out if the FBI has been lying to the public. That is, if the department complies. It has flouted so many subpoenas, and played so many games with redactions and deadlines, that the entire House GOP united last week to vote for the resolution demanding submission to Congress’s requests for documents.
“They’re going to get beaten so badly,” he said in an interview with Fox News last weekend. “I think they’ll never win another election. So I’m actually quite happy about it.”
He echoed those sentiments in a message posted to his personal Twitter feed late Monday, saying many voters would be “joining the Republican Party” in the coming months.
In parting, he condemned the "toxic, chaotic, disrespectful and subversive" environment in Washington. Fourteen months

HR McMaster, National Security Adviser - 22 March 2018
A lieutenant general with the US Army, Mr McMaster served in Iraq and Afghanistan, where he worked on a government anti-corruption drive. He replaced Lt Gen Michael Flynn, who was fired after just three weeks and three days in the job after he misled Vice-President Pence about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. Time magazine named him as one of its 100 most influential people in the world in 2014, saying he "might be the 21st Century Army's pre-eminent warrior-thinker".
Referendum to remove ‘outdated’ clause encouraging mothers to choose domestic duties over paid employment to be held by November
Ireland to vote over constitution clause on women's role in the home
Ireland will hold a referendum to remove a clause in the constitution marking the importance of a woman’s “life within the home” and encouraging mothers to shun paid employment to fulfil domestic duties, the government has announced. The move unveiled on Thursday is the latest to update Ireland’s socially conservative 1937 constitution to reflect a more secular and socially liberal population. Ireland was long one of Europe’s most socially conservative countries, but opinions have changed rapidly in recent decades as the power of the Roman Catholic church has waned. A 2015 referendum introduced gay marriage into the constitution and a vote earlier this year allowed access to abortion. The constitution, which includes a number of references to the country’s traditional Christian ethos, currently contains a clause that “recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the state a support without which the common good cannot be achieved”.
But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said. Tackett said he's concerned about children, especially in Eastern Kentucky, which has a higher rate of Medicaid patients and some of the state's worst oral health. "I have no problem with them regulating the adults that are on Medicaid," Tackett said. "If they are young and healthy, they should be out working or doing something.
Delivering a speech in Newcastle on Thursday, he said: “At the moment, protectionism is largely just talk (and tweets). But what if rhetoric becomes reality?”
Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.
The grandmother meanwhile said she didn't know for about 10 days what happened to her youngest grandchild, 4-year-old Yahir, or his mother. “I was desperate, I called every number I saw in the news, I looked for their faces in the TV reports," Cáceres said. "I was very scared because [Yahir] was born prematurely and he has always been a small and sickly child.”
Then she got a call from Nubia from a jail near the border, Cáceres said. She said the boy's mother asked for money for food because the child had a high fever and was refusing to eat the jail's food. Nubia and her son were released soon after, and Cáceres paid for them to travel by bus from Texas to her Florida home.

Despite no signs of North Korea abandoning its nuclear weapons any time soon, South Korea is literally bouncing ahead this week with peace efforts with its rival, which was threatening war just months ago. Two days of friendly basketball games winding up Thursday in Pyongyang were the latest in a slew of goodwill gestures between the Koreas in recent months. The women's and men's matches came just ahead of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's arrival in North Korea on Friday for two days of talks over the future of the North's nuclear program. A capacity crowd of 12,000 applauded as the teams — dressed in white jerseys that read "Peace" and green jerseys that read "Prosperity" — marched onto the court holding hands. Players from the North and South were mixed into teams for Wednesday's games.
In some offices, dictation is automated into reports through voice recognition software, but this is an imperfect practice and often requires additional double-checking by a real human. Something that seems like a minor error — a misspelling, for example — can have consequences if that record is ever pulled as part of a malpractice suit.

'Debate each other vigorously even as we fight alongside each other in the battle against modern tyranny, but end those debates with a handshake.' Participants of the 'Women's March on Washington' gather for a demonstrating in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin on Jan. 21 2018. Large crowds are attending the anti-Trump rally one year and one day after US President Donald J. Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States.
The list of Democrats expressing frustration with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has been growing longer in recent weeks, but don’t expect to see former President Barack Obama’s name on it. At a party fundraising event Friday afternoon in Northern California, Obama spoke highly of Pelosi – and even predicted that she will return to the job of House speaker after November’s midterm elections. “I think everybody knows how much I love Nancy Pelosi,” Obama told the gathering at a home in affluent Atherton, Politico reported. "Nancy, I believe, is one of the greatest speakers we ever had, and will once again be one of the greatest speakers we ever have after we get through this cycle," he continued. “And there's not much I could have gotten done without having Nancy there alongside of me every step of the way.”
"Nancy, I believe, is one of the greatest speakers we ever had, and will once again be one of the greatest speakers we ever have after we get through this cycle."
The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.
We look at other parts of the world, where women are not allowed to vote, or dance, and we see ourselves as modern and liberated. But all our “freedoms” are fairly recent, from being able to get a mortgage to being protected from rape in marriage. The narrative of progress is one that too many liberals imbibe, but it is untrue. In many of the areas to which we turn when we measure gender equality, we have not moved forward for the past 10 years – income, political engagement, education.

HR McMaster, National Security Adviser - 22 March 2018
A lieutenant general with the US Army, Mr McMaster served in Iraq and Afghanistan, where he worked on a government anti-corruption drive. He replaced Lt Gen Michael Flynn, who was fired after just three weeks and three days in the job after he misled Vice-President Pence about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. Time magazine named him as one of its 100 most influential people in the world in 2014, saying he "might be the 21st Century Army's pre-eminent warrior-thinker".
Nearly 600 more retail jobs are to go in the UK as the Jacques Vert, Windsmoor and Precis department store brands are wound down by administrators. Administrators said they had failed to find a buyer for Calvetron Brands, which had been restructured following a rescue deal last summer. The business entered administration in May and had already shed more than 400 jobs before Wednesday’s announcement. The latest retail job losses come as more than 30,000 jobs are at risk in the UK following mass closure announcements by major chains including House of Fraser, New Look and Marks & Spencer. Retailers are suffering from rising costs and the switch to online shopping just as hard-pressed consumers rein in spending.
Trump Administration Reverses Obama-Era Affirmative Action In Schools The White House is withdrawing Obama-era guidance documents that encouraged schools and colleges to promote racial diversity through their admissions process.
These numbers are similar to those from a February Quinnipiac poll, where 49 percent of voters said Trump was racist and 46 percent said he was not. Forty-four percent of voters said they think “racist beliefs” were a motive in Trump’s immigration policy, while 50 percent said Trump has “a sincere interest in controlling our borders.” Sixty percent said the policy of separating children from their parents at the border was a violation of human rights. Since enacting the policy, Trump and his associates have repeatedly pushed false, racist narratives to garner support, often associating immigration with high crime rates despite no evidence to support claims that immigrants commit more crime than U.S. citizens. While only 11 percent of Republican voters in the Quinnipiac poll said they think Trump is a racist, 22 percent said they believe Trump has emboldened racist people to express their beliefs publicly. The number of hate crimes rose the year Trump was elected ― the first increase in over a decade.
Jose Arizmendi, 54, a native of Mexico, pleaded guilty in April 1996 to aggravated sexual assault of a child in the District Court of Harris County, Texas … When the Department of Justice filed a complaint in federal court to initiate denaturalization proceedings in February 2015, Arizmendi was serving an 18-year prison sentence in Mexico for a separate sex offense of rape that he committed in that country. Araceli Martinez aka Maria Araceli Ramos de Martinez, 53, a native of Mexico, pleaded guilty in September 2012 to Obtaining Money, Labor or Property by False Pretense in violation of California Penal Code § 532(a) in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles. Between June 2011 and March 2012, Martinez engaged in a scheme in which she impersonated a U.S. immigration officer. Fosia Abdi Adan, 51, a native of Somalia, applied for and received a diversity visa from the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, Yemen, under the Diversity Visa (DV) Program on Jan. 10, 2001, and used her visa to unlawfully obtain beneficiary visas for the below individuals who were ineligible to be beneficiaries. Adan arrived and was admitted to the United States on Jan. 29, 2001, on her diversity immigrant visa as a permanent resident.
Harley-Davidson responded by saying it would shift production of motorbikes for the EU market out of the US. A different president might have seen this as a warning of the collateral damage likely to be caused to the US economy from a trade war, but not this one. In phase two, Trump says he will target $200bn of Chinese goods and is threatening to put a 20% duty on automotive imports from Europe. Both will inevitably provoke tit-for-tat retaliation. The White House has already signalled what phase three of the programme will involve: new investment restrictions on Chinese firms in an attempt to stop intellectual property theft; and the US leaving the World Trade Organisation on the grounds that the Geneva-based body was designed by the rest of the world to screw America.
"We are driven to the conclusion that it does."
“I was defending myself,” Sumpter said during the hearing. Judge John Blawie told Sumpter that he believed his version of events, but had to follow the letter of the law. Under Connecticut law, assault victims cannot use deadly force if they are able to retreat from their attackers. By contrast, 27 states — most notably Florida — have passed so-called “stand-your-ground” laws, which entitle citizens to use force in self-defense if there is a reasonable belief of a threat.

Pentagon Questioned Over Blackout On War Zone Troop Numbers
Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images
For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.
About four years ago, Dais had lined up a Chinese company to help develop its business in nanotechnology that helps produce clean water. Tangredi said the Chinese company persuaded a long-time Dais employee to defect with trade secrets. "They just stole it, and they are using it against us," he said. Tangredi said he hopes the threat of a trade war will force China to rethink its practices: "You've got to do something to get their attention."
It was President Obama who left his party in this position. His anti-business agenda was unpopular, but was never revisited. Democrats’ losses over the past decade stemmed in large part from a slow-growth economy that never gained momentum. Even though he received what he called a “shellacking” in the 2010 midterms, and even though the GOP made unprecedented political gains during his tenure, President Obama was always convinced the country was behind him. As Mara Liasson wrote for NPR in 2016: “During Obama's eight years in office, the Democrats have lost more House, Senate, state legislative and governors seats than under any other president.” She noted that the Obama legacy includes “one huge failure: a diminished Democratic Party.”
In 2013, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., invoked the so-called “nuclear option,” discarding traditional filibuster protections for the minority party in favor of requiring only a simple majority to approve judicial and executive branch nominees.
Republicans are more likely to rate secure borders as a strong value; Democrats are more likely to rate welcoming immigrants and refugees as a strong value. In follow-up interviews, there was angst over the Trump administration policy, now modified, of separating children from their parents when they cross the border illegally. "There's always been immigrants; that's what this country is," says Kimberly Bainter, 29, of Norfolk, Virginia. The United States has become "less welcoming" than it used to be, says Harry Bridgen, 56, a band manager from Studio City, California, adding, "How scared and alone these children must feel." Hundreds of thousands rallied across the country Saturday to protest the immigration policy that resulted in more than 2,000 children separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border.
If you look at his high school yearbook, it said he wanted to be a lawyer. But I think he got involved with various movements, and that was more important to him at the time.

Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.
In their statement, Mr Netanyahu and Mr Morawiecki praised the Polish wartime government-in-exile, saying it tried to "raise awareness among Western allies of the systematic murder" of Polish Jews. They also said structures of the Polish underground state supervised by the Polish government-in-exile "created a mechanism of systematic help and support to Jewish people". However Yad Vashem said this contradicted decades of historical research and contained "grave errors and deceptions". It said much of the Polish resistance in its various movements "not only failed to help Jews, but was also not infrequently actively involved in persecuting them". Polish assistance to Jews during the Holocaust was "relatively rare", Yad Vashem said, and "attacks against and even the murder of Jews were widespread".

Last month the Commerce Department reported that housing starts rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.35 million, the strongest pace since July 2007, thanks to a surge of building in the Midwest. Even as government budgets have tightened, construction of public projects in May rose 0.7 percent to $304.1 billion, the highest since October 2010. That gain was fueled by a 0.6 percent rise in state and local construction, which accounts for more than 90 percent of total government activity. State and local government construction spending was $282.1 billion, the most since September of 2009. Spending on the power grid increased nearly 11 percent on a monthly basis, and is up more than 25 percent over a year ago.
Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.
She said she believed it would be inappropriate to ask a nominee how they would vote on a future case. But she emphasized that they had to talk about precedent. In her view, Roe v.

"A number of judges (have told me) that good judges are always unhappy with some of their decisions but they make the right call regardless of their personal views.

U.S. Government lawyers are slamming one of President Donald Trump's most prominent critics, attorney Michael Avenatti, over nearly half a million dollars in unpaid federal taxes owed by his former firm. Avenatti's former law firm, Eagan Avenatti LLP, agreed to make the roughly $452,000 tax payment last month in order to resolve a bankruptcy case, but the funds never arrived at the IRS, according to a filing Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, Calif.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.

Mexico is the second largest economy in Latin America and a major oil exporter. However, oil prices have dropped and the Mexican currency, the peso, has fallen sharply against the dollar. More than 40% of the population lives in poverty and high levels of corruption and violence have led some companies to pull out of the worst affected areas.

Even Pruitt’s own staff had begun to sour on him, with many worrying that their future career prospects would be damaged by their association with Pruitt’s tenure. Each scandal seemed more damning than the last. Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.
There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void. In New Jersey, this is compounded by the fact that the state is located between two big cities, New York and Philadelphia, that are in other states. The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
“There are much, much worse Trump nominees they should go after...If I get to talk to Bernie, I’d say vote for him.” Thapar has shown he can be tough on both defendants and the government. He once sentenced a woman to 18 years in prison for assisting her jailed daughter to obtain drugs that killed her. But he also took the side of seven people who lost their disability benefits because their lawyer was accused of obtaining them improperly. Thapur wrote that the seven were given fewer rights by the government than a “member of al-Queda.”
Appointing Amul Thakar to the Supreme Court is an opportunity to make a bold outreach to the most prosperous of America’s immigrant communities and one that is increasingly important politically. The political benefits of naming Thapar are clear.

LONDON — Over the past century American and British troops have fought side-by-side in two World Wars, Korea and the conflicts in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan. But some lawmakers and experts in the United Kingdom are warning that the British military could soon be seen as irrelevant by the United States unless it receives a colossal funding boost. "There is a concern that the U.K. is falling ever further behind and becoming even more useless from a U.S. point of view," said Andrew Dorman, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a think tank in London.
However, I will say this is all very reminiscent of a lot of conversations we heard in 2008 about the old versus the new guard. I think, look, where are Democrats on the major policies? You know, minimum wage increase. Majority of Americans are there, right? Cortez ran on people over the money.
"Unlike our forerunners in 1968, those of us living today have access to something they didn't," said Mary Eberstadt, a widely published Catholic writer, "50 years of sociological, psychological, medical, and other evidence about the revolution's fallout." Some of the lines in Humanae Vitae, when stripped of mid-20th century cultural references, find echoes in contemporary concerns about nonconsensual sexual relations. "A man who grows accustomed to the use of contraceptive methods may forget the reverence due to a woman," the pope wrote, "... and reduce her to a mere instrument of his own desires." "This document that has been so controversial and in many places reviled," Eberstadt says, "actually called the shots on what the future would look like better than any other single source I could think of." Revisionist views of the 1968 encyclical have even taken hold among some Catholics who have not abided by its teaching.

The University of Missouri is still facing enrollment and budgetary problems, including a $49 million budget shortfall, as a result of the 2015 social justice protests that caught national media attention. Many people remember the high-pitched yell of former University of Missouri professor Melissa Click. Click found herself at the center of weeks of unrest at the University of Missouri in 2015 and 2016. Click rose to infamy after a video of her calling for a student photojournalist to be physically removed from campus simply because he was documenting the protests. The protests involved accusations by students that the administration had mishandled several alleged racial issues on campus.
Germany remains haunted by the Nazis' mass murder of Jews in 1933-1945. Ms Giffey, a centre-left Social Democrat (SPD) politician, said teachers needed more support to combat anti-Semitism, as the problem went beyond the classroom, involving parents and society at large. "So in the coming school year, as a first step, we will send 170 anti-bullying experts into selected schools in Germany, funded by the federal authorities," she told the daily Rheinische Post.

Even though he received what he called a “shellacking” in the 2010 midterms, and even though the GOP made unprecedented political gains during his tenure, President Obama was always convinced the country was behind him.

In 2013, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., invoked the so-called “nuclear option,” discarding traditional filibuster protections for the minority party in favor of requiring only a simple majority to approve judicial and executive branch nominees. He carved out an exception for people put forward for the Supreme Court. The next year – with CNN describing President Obama as an “unpopular president limping through his second term” – Republicans reclaimed control of the Senate. As a result of that achievement, President Obama’s chances of securing a liberal majority on the high court all but disappeared.
“That was a very sad day for the country when that vote was cast,” Trump said in June. But Republican lawmakers dispute arguments suggesting their efforts to undo ObamaCare have been totally fruitless. “We eliminated the individual mandate that said that people had to buy government-approved insurance,” said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo. “In a sense, it blew a big hole in ObamaCare.”
There’s a potential electoral landmine ahead for Republicans hoping to keep their majorities in the House and Senate, though: premium increases. “We’re going to get another round right before the election, which is something the GOP is nervous about,” said John C. Goodman, president of the Goodman Institute.
Delivering a speech in Newcastle on Thursday, he said: “At the moment, protectionism is largely just talk (and tweets). But what if rhetoric becomes reality?”
Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.

Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.
Research has consistently shown that Trump won because of racial resentment among white voters. Chris Hayes (@chrislhayes) The modern GOP is basically Steve Bannon, Steve King and Stephen Miller on one side engaged in a project to preserve and enshrine dominance for its ethnic/racial base, and Paul Ryan and John Roberts on the other who pretend they have no idea what they’re up to. While that strategy has worked in the short-term, some Republicans recognize that it can’t work in the long-term, and they’re fighting to save their party from extinction. Can a carbon tax save the GOP? Climate change is one of many issues that divides the Republican Party.
But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said. Tackett said he's concerned about children, especially in Eastern Kentucky, which has a higher rate of Medicaid patients and some of the state's worst oral health. "I have no problem with them regulating the adults that are on Medicaid," Tackett said. "If they are young and healthy, they should be out working or doing something.
Rep. Jim Jordan Denies He Knew Of Decades-Long Sexual Abuse At Ohio State

Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, one of the most powerful conservatives in Congress, has denied reports that he ignored the alleged sexual abuse of athletes while he worked as an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University more than 20 years ago. Allegations that Jordan was aware of sexual misconduct and explicitly was informed of specific incidents of alleged assault by the wrestling team's doctor, first surfaced in an NBC news story on Tuesday. But Jordan — who was an assistant coach from 1987 until 1995, when he was elected to the state legislature — has refuted the claims. "Congressman Jordan never saw any abuse, never heard about any abuse, and never had any abuse reported to him during his time as a coach at Ohio State," Ian Fury, Jordan's spokesman, said in a statement. "He has not been contacted by investigators about the matter but will assist them in any way they ask, because if what is alleged is true, the victims deserve a full investigation and justice."
They said there are over 300 German automotive facilities in the United States, supporting nearly 120,000 jobs. Instead of imposing tariffs, Merkel said the United States should work with its partners to find a multilateral solution that address its trade complaints. ''Germany will do everything to prevent the situation from escalating," she said. -- Nadine Schmidt and Kevin Tschierse contributed reporting.
About four years ago, Dais had lined up a Chinese company to help develop its business in nanotechnology that helps produce clean water. Tangredi said the Chinese company persuaded a long-time Dais employee to defect with trade secrets. "They just stole it, and they are using it against us," he said. Tangredi said he hopes the threat of a trade war will force China to rethink its practices: "You've got to do something to get their attention."
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
POLITICO Playbook: Michael Cohen speaks
NEW YORK, NY - MAY 30: Michael Cohen, (C) former personal lawyer and confidante for President Donald Trump, exits the United States District Court Southern District of New York on May 30, 2018 in New York City. According to a filing submitted to the court Tuesday night by special master Barbara Jones, federal prosecutors investigating Michael Cohen, a longtime personal lawyer and confidante for President Donald Trump, are set to receive 1 million files from three of his cellphones that were seized last month.

BREAKING ... ABC NEWS' GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS SPOKE TO MICHAEL COHEN: "Michael Cohen says family and country, not President Trump, is his 'first loyalty'": "When I asked Cohen directly what he would do if prosecutors forced him to choose between protecting the president and protecting his family, he said his family is 'my first priority.' "Cohen added: 'Once I understand what charges might be filed against me, if any at all, I will defer to my new counsel, Guy Petrillo, for guidance.' Story Continued Below
"But when I pointed out to Cohen that he wasn’t repeating past vows to 'take a bullet' and 'do anything' to protect the president, the longtime Trump loyalist left little doubt about where he stands now, saying simply: 'To be crystal clear, my wife, my daughter and my son, and this country have my first loyalty.'
Full-service restaurants with more elaborate menus and more complex processes, like the Red Hen and those in The Trump Organization properties, are more vulnerable to violations than fast-food eateries with limited food offerings and a streamlined kitchen production line, said Craig Hedberg, a professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Minnesota. And those with repeated violations can get into even more trouble with their local health departments, said Hedberg. Those eateries will be flagged by inspectors, who bring copies of previous reports on their visits and can spot patterns of regulation flouting. How repeat offenses are handled differs by jurisdiction. “It’s very rare to see a perfect score,” he said.
The list of Democrats expressing frustration with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has been growing longer in recent weeks, but don’t expect to see former President Barack Obama’s name on it. At a party fundraising event Friday afternoon in Northern California, Obama spoke highly of Pelosi – and even predicted that she will return to the job of House speaker after November’s midterm elections. “I think everybody knows how much I love Nancy Pelosi,” Obama told the gathering at a home in affluent Atherton, Politico reported. "Nancy, I believe, is one of the greatest speakers we ever had, and will once again be one of the greatest speakers we ever have after we get through this cycle," he continued. “And there's not much I could have gotten done without having Nancy there alongside of me every step of the way.”

“This was probably the best term that conservatives had in the supreme court maybe in my lifetime,” he said. The term might provide only “a very, very modest preview” of waves of conservative rulings to come, however, because a locked-down conservative majority would likely inspire rightwing activists to bring increasingly aggressive cases, said Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. “It’s not just that justice Kennedy’s successor is likely going to move the court to the right,” Vladeck said.

Trump’s campaign to limit legal and illegal immigration is driving up wages and salaries for Americans in various locations and careers around the country. The beneficiaries include new employees, African-American bakers in Chicago, Latino restaurant workers in Monterey, Calif., disabled people nationwide, high schoolers, resort workers in Hilton Head, construction workers, Superbowl workers, the garment industry, and workers at small businesses, and even Warren Buffett’s railroad workers. Amnesty advocates rely on business-funded “Nation of Immigrants” push-polls to show apparent voter support for immigration and immigrants. But “choice” polls reveal most voters’ often-ignored preference that CEOs should hire Americans at decent wages before hiring migrants.
You can’t push any group of people that hard, that fast and for that long and expect them to maintain their composure.”
Eric Young, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees’ Council of Prison Locals, now prays before he looks at his phone every morning, worried he’ll receive a message from BOP’s director notifying him of a staff death. Young estimates that around two-thirds of his union members were Trump supporters. That makes sense: It’s a law enforcement agency that leans white and male (72 percent male, 62 percent white), and many federal prisons are in rural parts of the country, which Trump dominated. But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau. BOP has long suffered the kind of problems you’d expect for a massive bureaucracy centered on caging tens of thousands of people.
Pentagon Questioned Over Blackout On War Zone Troop Numbers

For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.

But some people thought the photo looked like they were kissing on the lips - and a backlash followed, led by far-right online users who accused her of getting too friendly with foreigners. "'I'll cut out your uterus' they wrote to me. They even attached two pictures of a weapon that looked like a dagger," says Maria. The abusive messages poured in all night long and she became scared.

This was particularly an issue for Pruitt’s former executive scheduler Sydney Hupp, who often had to shell out for Pruitt’s trips. Hupp was also asked by Pruitt to speak with staff at one of Trump’s hotels, believing he could get a deal on a second-hand mattress they were selling. Pruitt remained miserly even when he was abusing his position to get a good deal. He fell behind on the rental payments on the condo he was getting on the cheap and eventually had to be evicted and the locks were changed.
3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.

“That was a very sad day for the country when that vote was cast,” Trump said in June. But Republican lawmakers dispute arguments suggesting their efforts to undo ObamaCare have been totally fruitless. “We eliminated the individual mandate that said that people had to buy government-approved insurance,” said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo. “In a sense, it blew a big hole in ObamaCare.”
There’s a potential electoral landmine ahead for Republicans hoping to keep their majorities in the House and Senate, though: premium increases. “We’re going to get another round right before the election, which is something the GOP is nervous about,” said John C. Goodman, president of the Goodman Institute.
In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners.

I think it is time for Mr. James to become a Republican. Guy Randolph

It’s shocking that Mr. James is surprised by the positive economic results of less regulation and lower taxes.
But reports suggest that the mood among some of her MPs has soured. It's not just in pre-election Bavaria that anti-migrant rhetoric has borne fruit. When the leaders of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) crowed on Tuesday that they were "hunting the union, driving it before us" they were not entirely wrong in claiming triumph over the CDU and CSU. Mrs Merkel has failed to achieve her original dream - a Europe that would truly share the responsibility for sheltering asylum seekers.

NEW YORK — House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) has referred 15 individuals, including longtime Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal, for possible “open setting” testimony in the ongoing Russia investigation. The list was sent to House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA). Many of the names are tied to the discredited anti-Trump dossier produced by the controversial Fusion GPS firm, which was paid for its dossier work by both Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) via the Perkins Coie lawfirm. Indeed, Perkins Coie attorney Marc E. Elias, who reportedly was involved in arranging the payments that resulted in the dossier, made the Nunes list. As did Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson.

Jeff Burke, APS director of resources planning, says customers would see 6 to 14 percent per year increases on their bills if the company is forced to ratchet up renewable use ahead of schedule. "We continue to add renewables to our system, but they have to make sense," Burke said. "It's not really about a target, it's about what makes sense for our customers' usage and what makes rates affordable and what keeps our system reliable." Thirty-two states with renewable standards didn't have, on average, a correlated rate increase, according to Wesley Hersche, an associate director of research with Arizona State University's Global Security Initiative. "These issues involve a complex interaction of factors, and we should be careful not to oversimplify things," Hersche wrote in April.
There is reason to believe that might happen. The foundation, in conjunction with UIC, recently held its Chicago Community Conversation on the West Side. The event at UIC drew nearly 350 community activists, representing a broad range of interests, to exchange ideas about some of the city’s most pressing issues. Like most foundation forums, it was a spectacular event, drawing everyone from MacArthur Foundation “genius grant” winner Rami Nashashibi to philanthropic organizations to Tony- and Grammy-winning performer Daveed Diggs. Notably absent, though, was Obama.
Focusing much-needed attention on the South Side does not give the city a license to ignore other struggling neighborhoods. Three years ago, when UIC and the University of Chicago were both engaged in aggressive campaigns to woo the presidential center to their neighborhoods, things got a little testy. People forgot that although there were two separate bids from Chicago, the South Side and the West Side were playing for the same team. Everyone took a deep breath and thought about the alternative — losing the center to either New York or Hawaii. So in a striking show of unity, the two universities came together for a community breakfast designed to send a message to Obama.
"We don't underestimate the impact that the deaths of these young people will be having in the community and we would ask that people focus on supporting each other and supporting the police investigation."
Part of its mission is to provide local veterans with a monthly ration of what he calls medical-grade cannabis free of charge. It started back in 2011. Newsom and his co-founder began growing and sharing pot as an alternative to the drugs the VA had them on. It has since grown to serve about 1,000 veterans. The office where he's sorting the cannabis sits above one of their grow operations.
"We're well, well aware of what the North Koreans have done in the past." Bolton essentially gave North Korea a year to get rid of its nuclear weapons. "We have developed a program, I'm sure that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be discussing this with the North Koreans in the near future, about really how to dismantle all of their [weapons of mass destruction] and ballistic missile programs in a year," Bolton said, setting a much faster timetable than what many disarmament experts think is feasible. "If they have the strategic decision already made to do that, and they're cooperative, we can move very quickly." The Arms Control Association's Kelsey Davenport says that's a big "if."

Those factories are the core of an American operation that employs about 136,000 people, but they're also dependent on components sourced overseas for reasons of cost or availability. About 70 percent of the parts in a U.S.-built Camry, the country's best-selling car, come from domestic suppliers. Toyota on June 27 said that Trump's threatened 25 percent tariff on automotive imports would add $1,800 to the price of each sedan. The carmaker's warning of the dangers of tit-for-tat tariffs was just one of many. German lighting manufacturer Osram Licht's shares plunged 22 percent Thursday after it announced a weaker outlook due to trade tensions.

The United States has always been both a major producer and consumer of oil, which means that most presidents have favored moderate oil prices. High prices hurt motorists and oil consumers across the country.

There have been efforts to try to improve the sanitation in kitchens and (improve) the public’s access to inspection results, which then provides a feedback mechanism both to the inspectors and the operators that people are watching." During the past three years, restaurants in Trump Organization properties have not been hit with shutdown orders — like the unanticipated outcome of a Nevada inspection in late 2012.
Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) trashed the June jobs report — even though it showed rapid job growth, rising wages, and low unemployment. The report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that employers created 213,000 new jobs in June — 22,000 more than economists had expected. Manufacturing jobs in particular rose by 36,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.

While the US tariffs aim to cut down the trade deficit, there are worries about how China's retaliatory tariffs will hit the US economy. The US Chamber of Commerce says some states will have billions of dollars worth of exports at risk. States such as Louisiana export about $5.7bn of goods to China. Several southern states, many of which also backed Trump in the election, also risk being hit.
The latest high-level departure from President Donald Trump's Cabinet was not the most unexpected departure that has faced the administration.

Here's a review of his time in office. Dec. 7, 2016: Trump announces that Pruitt will be his nominee for EPA administrator
The then-Attorney General of Oklahoma was touted by Trump as having "great qualifications and a good record." Part of that record was Pruitt touting himself as a "leading advocate against the EPA's activist agenda," and his history of challenging the EPA was well known.

A recurring insult being used is "Natashas" - a derogatory term used to describe girls and young women who end up being sold as sex slaves after having been lured by the promises of legitimate employment. But the disrespectful treatment of women isn't contained online - some traditional media outlets have also joined in. The daily Moskovsky Komsomolets published an article with the headline "The time of whores: Russians in the World Cup disgrace themselves and the country". On TV, the topic was discussed on Channel One's programme Time Will Show, where potentially gullible women should be reminded "these men are just here for a holiday".

But there have been voices - mostly from journalists and bloggers - speaking out against the persecution of Russian women on social media.
But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said. Tackett said he's concerned about children, especially in Eastern Kentucky, which has a higher rate of Medicaid patients and some of the state's worst oral health. "I have no problem with them regulating the adults that are on Medicaid," Tackett said. "If they are young and healthy, they should be out working or doing something.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.
The services sector, where most Americans are employed, has now expanded for 101 consecutive months, or more than eight years. The gain was better than many economists had been expecting and depicts an overall economy that appears to be regaining momentum after a slowdown in the winter.
Nebraska May Join Utah, Idaho in Putting Medicaid Expansion Before Voters
Enlarge this image toggle caption Fred Knapp/NET News Fred Knapp/NET News
Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo laughed Friday when asked whether he planned to present Kim Jong Un with a CD of the Elton John hit "Rocket Man." It was one of the more left-field questions posed by reporters after he landed in North Korea, a trip designed to "fill in some details" on the denuclearization agreement signed by Kim and President Donald Trump last month. The secretary of state's response neither confirmed nor denied a report in South Korea’s Chosun Ilbo newspaper that the recording was among the gifts Pompeo intended to present to Kim.
Pentagon Questioned Over Blackout On War Zone Troop Numbers
Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images
For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.
“What remains to be seen is whether the enthusiasm holds up in November.”
That has not been true of all past presidents. Andrew Jackson famously dismissed a court decision against his forced removal of the Cherokees from Georgia by saying: “The chief justice has made his ruling. Now let him enforce it.” As for today’s controversial immigration policies separating children from parents, they are, sadly, legal - a reminder that something may be immoral but not also illegal, and also a reminder that laws must be continually revised to reflect our highest societal moral standards. The Trump administration has also become adept at finding obscure, long dormant “national security” clauses in the federal codex to invoke as justification for steel and aluminum tariffs as well as punitive tariffs on Chinese goods (the latter has been announced but not yet enacted). These may be stupid policy, but they are not illegal - yet.

President Trump has just said in the past week he's going to raise things like Syria, like Ukraine, like the election meddling issue, really the whole range of issues between us. And I think that, in the president's mind, this is very important, because it gives him an opportunity to size up Vladimir Putin, to see where there are areas where we might make progress together and where there are areas where we may not. BRENNAN: Well, right now, Russia is blanket-bombing Southern Syria. That violates the last agreement Vladimir Putin made with President Trump. Why would he believe that he's in any way trustworthy?

The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.
Staff didn’t always have the proper privileges to make a correction, and if they even viewed a patient record, let alone made alterations to it, they could face disciplinary action. Ideally, computer systems would be able to automate these processes effectively and take humans out of the equation, giving doctors more time with patients. But in my experience, the less that humans were involved in the oversight and the more heavily the records relied solely on technology (even with stop-gap measures and programming meant to sound alarms when information didn’t compute), the more often aberrations found their way into records ― if not permanently, then at least long enough to conceivably do some damage. Errors were often harmless and more amusing than anything else for us clerks. I say this as someone who has an op note in my personal medical records in which my name is written “ABIGAIL NORMAL” — the formal version of the inescapable Mel Brooks “Young Frankenstein” Abby Normal references that have followed me my entire life.
However, oil prices have dropped and the Mexican currency, the peso, has fallen sharply against the dollar. More than 40% of the population lives in poverty and high levels of corruption and violence have led some companies to pull out of the worst affected areas. The run-up to Sunday's elections has seen some of the worst violence in living memory, our correspondent says, as criminal groups attempt to control local politics. More than 130 candidates and political workers have been killed across the country since campaigning began in September. On Saturday, a journalist was shot dead in a bar in the village of Saban in the southern state of Quintana Roo, officials said.

The Bezos balls, as the conservatories are popularly known, are modelled on the greenhouses at London’s Kew Gardens, feature walkways above fig trees, ferns and rhododendrons, and provide hot-desking for Amazon workers looking for a break from the neighbouring office tower.

The government agency that oversees immigration applications is hiring lawyers and immigration officers to review cases of immigrants suspected of obtaining citizenship through fake identities or other false information on their applications. Cases would be referred to the Department of Justice, where offenders could lose their citizenship or legal status. The small scale of this effort belies its significance. As a country, the United States makes few distinctions between naturalized citizens and their native-born counterparts. The naturalization process, which includes long-term residents with deep ties to the U.S., is assumed to be permanent.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections.

Federal Reserve officials last month said they expect to keep raising interest rates and suggested that by the next year, they could be high enough that they could start slowing growth, according to minutes of their discussion released Thursday. While noting a strong economy, Fed officials appeared vigilant about emerging risks, especially trade tensions, and the dangers of an economy that might overheat. The officials noted heightened concerns from businesses about President Donald Trump's get-tough trade policies and that some executives had already scaled back future spending plans because of the uncertainty. They also said they were monitoring changes in market-set interest rates. A narrowing in the gap between short-term and long-term rates has been an accurate predictor of downturns in the past.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
The president told Fox News that he believes his nominee will get some support from Democrats. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, an abortion rights supporter, is considered one of the key votes on a nominee. She said she wouldn't vote for someone who would overturn Roe v. Wade. "A candidate who would overturn Roe would not be acceptable," she said Sunday on ABC's This Week. Collins, who has previously bucked party lines on other key issues such as health care, said she plans to have an in-depth conversation with the nominee.
A "permanent" cease-fire the rivals agreed on last week was violated within hours on Saturday, with each side blaming the other. They have not yet agreed on any power-sharing deal. South Sudan's civil war has killed tens of thousands and created Africa's largest refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Millions are near famine and aid delivery is often blocked in one of the world's most dangerous countries for humanitarian workers. Both sides have been accused of abuses including gang-rapes, sometimes along ethnic lines.
3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.
A toddler born in immigration detention on Nauru will be brought to Australia to receive critical tests after the federal court ruled against a plan from the home affairs department to continue treating her in Papua New Guinea. The two-year-old girl and her mother were flown from Nauru to Port Moresby last month amid concerns the girl was dying of encephalitis. The hospital there had said it did not have the necessary equipment or specialist staff to treat her. She is the fourth refugee child held on Nauru brought to Australia either by court order or by threat of court action in the past seven months. The cost of the girl’s medevac flight to Port Moresby was $137,000 – $11,000 more than the cost of a flight to Australia, which was the option recommended by the department’s healthcare provider, International Health and Medical Services.

One participant said she didn't know, so the moderator asked for a show of hands. Few of them went up in the air. Fallon, who runs Demand Justice, said women in that focus group got more motivated once they understood that Kennedy was considered the high court's swing vote on abortion rights. Chris Kang, the chief counsel for Demand Justice, helped President Obama usher his Supreme Court picks through the Senate. He said Democrats tend to operate in issue silos, with people organizing around reproductive rights or issues related to lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender peoples' rights.
That came on the heels of 0.9 percent drop in March, the first monthly drop since July of 2017. Total private construction rose 0.3 percent, with residential projects up 0.8 percent in May. New single-family home construction rose 0.6 percent and the volatile apartment building sector jumped 1.6 percent. Private, non-residential building fell 0.3 percent. Economists are forecasting that construction spending will contribute to overall growth this year even though interest rates are rising.

Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.

The number of predominantly Christian people killed in Nigeria by Muslim Fulani terrorists in the first six months of this year has dwarfed the fatalities carried out by the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL)-affiliated Boko Haram, a non-governmental organization (NGO) based in the African country revealed this week. In one weekend last month (June 23 and 24), the Fulani stormed nearly a dozen Christian-majority villages in Nigeria’s Plateau state, using machetes and firearms to massacre at least 200 people, including women and children. Referring to the Plateau incident in an article published by Nigeria’s Daily Post, the NGO, known as the International Society for Civil Liberties and the Rule of Law (Intersociety), noted Monday that the fatalities from the Fulani massacre could reach 300, making it one of the deadliest by any group in Nigeria. Intersociety explains:
The total death toll in Plateau State following the 23rd and 24th June 2018 coordinated attacks and killings in eleven villages may most likely have hit 300, from its present 250, out of which 218 bodies have been recovered and buried in mass graves. The activists on the ground said dozens of people are still missing after the head count was carried out.

There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void. In New Jersey, this is compounded by the fact that the state is located between two big cities, New York and Philadelphia, that are in other states. The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.

Khalaf spent time in a camp for displaced people in northern Iraq before eventually relocating to Germany, where she lives now. Ahmed Khudida Burjus, the deputy director of Yazda, a U.S.-based Yazidi rights group, says around 7,000 women and girls were captured and sold into slavery, with nearly half eventually escaping. In Kocho alone, at least 500 men and boys were killed, and 800 women and girls taken away. The group has documented at least 54 mass graves of Yazidis, but says a lack of resources has delayed the exhumation of the remains, and that there may be more graves yet to be discovered. Over the past three years, Syrian and Iraqi forces have gradually driven IS out of nearly all the territory it once held.

Analysts say tariffs are not the most effective way of putting pressure on China, which the US accuses of unfair trade practices and stealing intellectual property from US companies. Syracuse University economics professor Mary Lovely and researcher Yang Liang found 87% of electronics products to be levied by US tariffs came from multinationals and joint ventures rather than Chinese firms. China’s economy is no longer as dependent on exports. Domestic consumption now accounts for more than half of the country’s GDP. Exports to the US account for only 19% of all of China’s exports.
PORTLAND, Ore. -- Two opposing protest groups -- Patriot Prayer and antifa -- clashed in downtown Portland Saturday, CBS Portland affiliate KOIN reports. Portland police said failure to leave the area could leave to arrests, calling the demonstration a riot.

Police revoked Patriot Prayer's permit for the rally after the two groups began to clash. People were lighting firecrackers and smoke bombs in the crowd while police used flash bangs in an effort to disperse the clashing protesters.

Teddy Roosevelt hopped on whistle stop tour after whistle stop tour where he was able to drop into rural and suburban communities alike to deliver short, pre-packaged speeches that local papers would usually print verbatim. (He left them short on purpose for that very reason.) Franklin Roosevelt revolutionized and heightened the stature of the office with his fireside chats, that brought his message over the heads of the pesky press corps and directly into the living rooms of the American people. But, though it would have been seen as a scoop, even the reporters covering Lyndon B. Johnson had the good sense not to report on every turd he dropped in their presence. While the founders envisioned a government that moved slowly and methodically, today’s Wi-Fi-enabled political discourse is demanding the opposite.
Daniel Egan tells inquiry that it was obvious everybody needed to get out, not stay put
The inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire has heard that a senior firefighter who arrived at the blaze just before 2am thought the residents should have been evacuated long before they were. During testimonies that made clear a lack of communication between firefighters, the inquiry heard how Daniel Egan, a senior fire safety officer with the London fire brigade arrived at the fire at 1.58am and immediately thought “we need to get people out of the building.”
“It looked like a film, people were shouting and screaming, they were panicking and wanting people to help,” he said. “My first thoughts were that we needed to get everybody out. I could hear the roar of the tower. It was obvious … you could hear people screaming … it was just so obvious, sorry.”
The “stay put” policy wasn’t abandoned until 2.47am, after which residents calling 999 who had been told to stay in their flats were told to try and evacuate.
Shapiro filed a document under seal seeking the release on Monday, the day the news organizations separately asked to intervene and argue for it to be made public with docket sheets and filings. The report concerns six of the state's Roman Catholic dioceses — Allentown, Erie, Greensburg, Harrisburg, Pittsburgh and Scranton. The grand jury supervising judge, Norman Krumenacker, described the investigation as involving allegations of child sexual abuse, failure to report it, endangering the welfare of children and obstruction of justice by people associated with the church, local public officials and community leaders.

Trump’s campaign to limit legal and illegal immigration is driving up wages and salaries for Americans in various locations and careers around the country. The beneficiaries include new employees, African-American bakers in Chicago, Latino restaurant workers in Monterey, Calif., disabled people nationwide, high schoolers, resort workers in Hilton Head, construction workers, Superbowl workers, the garment industry, and workers at small businesses, and even Warren Buffett’s railroad workers. Amnesty advocates rely on business-funded “Nation of Immigrants” push-polls to show apparent voter support for immigration and immigrants. But “choice” polls reveal most voters’ often-ignored preference that CEOs should hire Americans at decent wages before hiring migrants.
Trump then went around asking each leader if they were sure they didn't want a military solution, according to the official, who added that each leader told Trump in clear terms they were sure. Eventually, McMaster would pull aside the president and walk him through the dangers of an invasion, the official said. Taken together, the behind-the-scenes talks, the extent and details of which have not been previously reported, highlight how Venezuela's political and economic crisis has received top attention under Trump in a way that was unimaginable in the Obama administration. But critics say it also underscores how his "America First" foreign policy at times can seem outright reckless, providing ammunition to America's adversaries. The White House declined to comment on the private conversations.
Michael Avenatti told POLITICO that he's being targeted over his political views. | Seth Wenig/AP Photo Feds target Avenatti over old firm's unpaid taxes U.S. Attorney accuses Trump critic of 'misrepresentations' and 'misconduct.' U.S. Government lawyers are slamming one of President Donald Trump's most prominent critics, attorney Michael Avenatti, over nearly half a million dollars in unpaid federal taxes owed by his former firm. Avenatti's former law firm, Eagan Avenatti LLP, agreed to make the roughly $452,000 tax payment last month in order to resolve a bankruptcy case, but the funds never arrived at the IRS, according to a filing Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, Calif.

The submission from tax lawyers in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles attacks Avenatti personally, accusing him of trying to scam the federal government. "The Debtor and its principle [sic] Michael Avenatti made misrepresentations to the United States that it’s [sic] claim would be fully paid," Assistant U.S. Attorney Najah Shariff wrote.

"I really have been pleasantly surprised how willing he is to tell Chuck Schumer to go fly a kite," she added, referring to the Senate minority leader. At other times, however, Jones has taken up liberal positions seen as risky for a Democratic senator from a GOP state. He aligned himself with most of his Democratic colleagues against Gina Haspel, Trump's pick for CIA director, arguing that her record on enhanced interrogation techniques was unacceptable. And instead of focusing on a politically safe issue in his maiden Senate floor speech, Jones struck a nerve by calling for a dialogue on gun violence after the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida.
There is reason to believe that might happen. The foundation, in conjunction with UIC, recently held its Chicago Community Conversation on the West Side. The event at UIC drew nearly 350 community activists, representing a broad range of interests, to exchange ideas about some of the city’s most pressing issues. Like most foundation forums, it was a spectacular event, drawing everyone from MacArthur Foundation “genius grant” winner Rami Nashashibi to philanthropic organizations to Tony- and Grammy-winning performer Daveed Diggs. Notably absent, though, was Obama.
Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.

It’s not strictly true to say everyone is against the three huge plant-forested glass spheres at what Amazon calls its “campus” in the heart of the city. The Bezos balls, as the conservatories are popularly known, are modelled on the greenhouses at London’s Kew Gardens, feature walkways above fig trees, ferns and rhododendrons, and provide hot-desking for Amazon workers looking for a break from the neighbouring office tower.

In one case, Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion that illegal immigrants do not have the same bargaining rights as American citizens and legal workers. “… an illegal immigrant worker is not an ’employee’ under the NLRA for the simple reason that, ever since 1986, an illegal immigrant worker is not a lawful ’employee’ in the United States,” Kavanaugh wrote. In another case, Kavanaugh noted that American multi-national corporations do not have the right to import foreign workers. The Circuit judge explained, “Under the provision of the immigration laws at issue here, mere economic expediency does not authorize an employer to displace American workers for foreign workers.”
Prominent conservative Ann Coulter has also called for Trump to nominate Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, arguing that other judges such as Thomas Hardiman and Raymond Kethledge “are open borders zealots.”

She told authorities that she argued with her son Monday morning over the way she was being treated and was upset with his stating that he was going to place her in assisted living. According to the court records, Blessing told detectives she got out two handguns she has had since the 1970s — one bought at a gun store and the other obtained from her late husband. She concealed two pistols in the pockets of her robe before confronting her son in his bedroom and firing multiple shots at him with one handgun, investigators alleged. The gun was dislodged from Blessing's hand after a struggle with her son's girlfriend, as well as the second weapon, authorities said. The unidentified woman called authorities, and Blessing was found on a recliner in the home and taken into custody.
Most of the incidents involved the amputation of fingers or fingertips, but there were recordings of lost hands, arms or toes. During the period there were a total of 550 serious injuries which cover 22 of the 50 states so the true total for the USA would be substantially higher. Recorded injuries include:
An employee’s left arm had to be surgically amputated at the shoulder after it was pulled into the cubing machine during sanitation
A worker was reaching down to pick up a box to clear a jam when his jacket became caught in a roller. As he tried to pull it out, his hand got pulled in as well. His hand and lower arm were crushed
While an employee was attempting to remove the ribs from the spine of a cattle rib set, his hand made contact with a running vertical band saw and two of his fingers were amputated
An employee working on a sanitation crew pushed the stop button after removing parts from the upper portion of a machine.

Research has consistently shown that Trump won because of racial resentment among white voters. Chris Hayes (@chrislhayes) The modern GOP is basically Steve Bannon, Steve King and Stephen Miller on one side engaged in a project to preserve and enshrine dominance for its ethnic/racial base, and Paul Ryan and John Roberts on the other who pretend they have no idea what they’re up to. While that strategy has worked in the short-term, some Republicans recognize that it can’t work in the long-term, and they’re fighting to save their party from extinction. Can a carbon tax save the GOP? Climate change is one of many issues that divides the Republican Party.

Over the fireplace at Mingo Creek Craft Distillers, a whiskey purveyor in the small town of Washington, Pennsylvania, a portrait of Alexander Hamilton hangs upside down. With snowy hair and a black velvet jacket, Hamilton wears an impassive look that might be described as hauteur. In 1791, to pay off debts the newly formed United States incurred during the revolutionary war, Hamilton imposed the first federal tax on the people of the region. By taxing their most lucrative product, whiskey, he became what he is here today: a villain representing the excesses of the federal government. The town of Washington is only a six-hour drive from Manhattan, but it’s a world away from the Broadway stage where Hamilton, clad in snug white knickers, enjoys a better reputation.
Germany remains haunted by the Nazis' mass murder of Jews in 1933-1945. Ms Giffey, a centre-left Social Democrat (SPD) politician, said teachers needed more support to combat anti-Semitism, as the problem went beyond the classroom, involving parents and society at large. "So in the coming school year, as a first step, we will send 170 anti-bullying experts into selected schools in Germany, funded by the federal authorities," she told the daily Rheinische Post.

Five children 15 and younger were among 23 people shot during a scorching weekend in Chicago. From Friday afternoon to early Monday, 21 people were wounded and two people were killed, including a 14-year-old boy who was shot early Saturday while walking in the Washington Park neighborhood, according to police. About nine hours earlier, another 14-year-old boy was shot in the Loop. He was coming up stairs at the corner of Wabash Avenue and Wacker Drive when he was shot in the leg Friday evening, police said. Late Sunday night, three girls ages 5, 14 and 15 were shot while sitting in a parked car with their mother in the East Garfield Park neighborhood, police said.

The current tax splash is its last throw of the dice, a direct pitch for people who have lost faith in government to take the money instead. It sends the subtle message that the economy is travelling well and there’s money to spare. But it’s the inability of a decentralised wages system to share the growth, and the overreach in destroying Australia’s progressive tax system, that remains the ultimate hand-brake for these cuts to be the path to redemption for the government.

The report says the combined value of metallurgical and thermal coal exports will be $60.2bn in 2017-18, behind iron ore at $61.8bn. It says coal exports will be slightly lower at $58.1bn in 2018-19, and that iron ore earnings will be even lower at $57.7bn, as falling iron ore prices drive export earnings lower. The Australian characterised that event as coal reclaiming its mantle as the nation’s “top export earner”. But the report says coal export earnings will soon drop below those for iron ore again, as global coal prices fall. India's huge solar ambitions could push coal further into shade Read more
In 2019-20 coal export earnings will be just $51.1bn, while iron ore earnings will be $55.4bn.
There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void. In New Jersey, this is compounded by the fact that the state is located between two big cities, New York and Philadelphia, that are in other states. The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.
Pentagon Questioned Over Blackout On War Zone Troop Numbers
Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images
For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.
On this much police and activist South Side priest Michael Pfleger can agree: Saturday morning’s anti-violence march on the Dan Ryan Expressway is all about danger. Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.

COLOMBO, July 2 (Reuters) - Sri Lankan shares fell over 1 percent on Monday, the sharpest in nearly 28 months, as continued foreign selling and concerns about lower economic growth hurt sentiment, stockbrokers said. Foreign investors sold the island nation’s risky assets for an eighth successive session, extending the foreign outflow to 841.4 million rupees ($5.32 million).

While other data on Thursday showed private payrolls rising less than expected last month and a surprise increase in new applications for unemployment benefits last week, overall labor market conditions continue to tighten. The labor market is considered to be near or at full employment, with the jobless rate at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent. The unemployment rate has dropped by three-tenths of a percentage point this year and is near the Federal Reserve’s forecast of 3.6 percent by the end of this year.

POLITICO Playbook: Michael Cohen speaks
NEW YORK, NY - MAY 30: Michael Cohen, (C) former personal lawyer and confidante for President Donald Trump, exits the United States District Court Southern District of New York on May 30, 2018 in New York City. According to a filing submitted to the court Tuesday night by special master Barbara Jones, federal prosecutors investigating Michael Cohen, a longtime personal lawyer and confidante for President Donald Trump, are set to receive 1 million files from three of his cellphones that were seized last month.

BREAKING ... ABC NEWS' GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS SPOKE TO MICHAEL COHEN: "Michael Cohen says family and country, not President Trump, is his 'first loyalty'": "When I asked Cohen directly what he would do if prosecutors forced him to choose between protecting the president and protecting his family, he said his family is 'my first priority.' "Cohen added: 'Once I understand what charges might be filed against me, if any at all, I will defer to my new counsel, Guy Petrillo, for guidance.' Story Continued Below
"But when I pointed out to Cohen that he wasn’t repeating past vows to 'take a bullet' and 'do anything' to protect the president, the longtime Trump loyalist left little doubt about where he stands now, saying simply: 'To be crystal clear, my wife, my daughter and my son, and this country have my first loyalty.'

The nonpartisan Cook Political Report says Democrats are "likely" to carry Montana in the Senate race. Inside Elections rates the contest as one that "tilts Democratic." After the rally, the spokesman for Tester's re-election campaign put out a statement that was critical of Rosendale but which did not mention the president. "Jon's record is clear—if it's good for Montana, Jon works with anyone from either party to get things done. If it's bad for Montana, he'll stand up to anyone," Tester spokesman Chris Meagher said.
As he departed the presidential mansion in the morning, Trump took to Twitter. In addition to a general salutation – "Happy Fourth of July....Our Country is doing GREAT!" – Trump also tweeted out a video in which he salutes the authors of the Declaration of Independence and the American solders who won the revolutionary war against Great Britain. Happy Fourth of July....Our Country is doing GREAT! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 4, 2018

Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.
In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions.

Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left a demoralized agency where staff fear their ability to protect public health is diminished
Scott Pruitt is out but his impact on the environment will be felt for years
Scott Pruitt, who has finally stepped down as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency after a long-rumbling corruption scandal, rose to public prominence on the back of a series of increasingly outlandish ethical controversies. Scott Pruitt resigns: Trump's scandal-ridden EPA chief steps down Read more
From lobbying fast food company Chick-fil-A on behalf of his wife, to demanding his staff acquire a mattress from a Trump Hotel – not to mention the millions of taxpayer dollars spent on security, first-class travel and soundproof booths – Pruitt’s behavior clashed spectacularly with any pretense of Trump’s pledge to “drain the swamp” in Washington. But the lasting legacy of the former Oklahoma attorney general – who was picked by Trump after crusading against what he called the EPA’s “activist agenda” – is likely to be felt in the systematic weakening of environmental regulations. While not as eye-catching as, for example, his demand that his official vehicle use sirens so he could reach a French restaurant on time, Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left behind a demoralized agency where staff fret that their ability to protect public health has been diminished. A staunch ally of oil and gas companies, Pruitt stacked EPA advisory boards with industry representatives and sought to set aside whole troves of research that link pollution to various illnesses.

A Highland Park man who operated a cellular telephone distributorship has been sentenced to two years in prison for evading more than $800,000 in personal and corporate income taxes between 2008 and 2012, according to federal prosecutors. Jordan Ecklerling, 53, the owner of Pagecomm of Illinois Inc., is scheduled to report to the Federal Bureau of Prisons Sept. 28 as a result of the sentence handed down June 29 by U.S. District Judge Virginia M. Kendall. According to the U.S. Attorney’s office in Chicago, Ecklerling paid the $806,099 in tax obligations owed to the federal and state government while the case was pending. He pled guilty in January to one count of tax evasion, which carried a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $100,000 fine. In the plea deal, Eckerling acknowledged that as sole shareholder and company officer, he attempted to conceal income by having the company issue him business checks that he then cashed and used for personal expenses.

The gun was dislodged from Blessing's hand after a struggle with her son's girlfriend, as well as the second weapon, authorities said. The unidentified woman called authorities, and Blessing was found on a recliner in the home and taken into custody.
In one case, Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion that illegal immigrants do not have the same bargaining rights as American citizens and legal workers. “… an illegal immigrant worker is not an ’employee’ under the NLRA for the simple reason that, ever since 1986, an illegal immigrant worker is not a lawful ’employee’ in the United States,” Kavanaugh wrote. In another case, Kavanaugh noted that American multi-national corporations do not have the right to import foreign workers. The Circuit judge explained, “Under the provision of the immigration laws at issue here, mere economic expediency does not authorize an employer to displace American workers for foreign workers.”
Prominent conservative Ann Coulter has also called for Trump to nominate Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, arguing that other judges such as Thomas Hardiman and Raymond Kethledge “are open borders zealots.”

Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement announcement has set off a political tempest as the question of his successor is considered. Among those reported to be among the top of President Donald Trump’s short list is Judge Brett Kavanaugh on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The prospect of a Justice Kavanaugh worries some consumer advocates, who say he has taken an activist position against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the regulator implemented in the wake of the Great Recession in the hopes of thwarting future financial meltdowns.
“They have to put out another 2 million barrels in my opinion,” he said in the July 1 Fox interview. “Gas prices are up & they are doing little to help,” he complained again on Twitter on July 4. “This must be a two-way street. REDUCE PRICING NOW!”
DRIVERS AND VOTERS
The United States has always been both a major producer and consumer of oil, which means that most presidents have favored moderate oil prices. High prices hurt motorists and oil consumers across the country.
California's utilities are “public monopolies” that are given a legislated profit. They are allowed to be monopolies in return for benefiting the public. San Diego Gas and Electric wants ratepayers to pay for its negligence in regards to wildfires. Southern California Edison wants to pass along the costs of its mismanagement at the San Onofre nuclear plant. Pacific Gas and Electric wants ratepayers to cover the cost of a settlement for its 2010 pipeline explosion.
But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau. BOP has long suffered the kind of problems you’d expect for a massive bureaucracy centered on caging tens of thousands of people. The federal population skyrocketed from less than 25,000 in 1980 to nearly 222,000 by 2013. A bipartisan, congressionally mandated report on federal prisons issued in 2016 said the system was in a state of crisis and called for massive changes to the nation’s sentencing policies in order to relieve the strain. Unsurprisingly in an election year, wide changes weren’t implemented.
Did he display these tendencies? He was a fairly good mayor. He used his term as mayor many times during the campaign [to show] how he was more pragmatic rather than authoritarian. And in that he is correct. He was also fairly popular as mayor and ended his term with a very respectable approval rating.
"People who use opioids, including heroin, were up to 13 times more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system," says Winkelman. The study shows the complexity of the the opioid crisis, according to Josiah Rich, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Brown University, who wasn't involved in the research. It shows "the spectrum of the disease and its overlap with the criminal justice system, showing that the more you progress along that continuum, the more likely you are to get tangled up in the criminal justice system." The study also showed that most people with opioid use disorder had other mental illnesses and were also more likely to have certain chronic health conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The study authors argue for the need to engage and involve the criminal justice system in dealing with the opioid epidemic, including reducing overdose deaths.
3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.
In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners. Alas, he is wasting his time trying to shift the views of the Democratic Party, which has become ever more left-wing, if not outright socialist. I think it is time for Mr. James to become a Republican. Guy Randolph

It’s shocking that Mr. James is surprised by the positive economic results of less regulation and lower taxes.
State Sen. Sam McCann will appear on the November ballot as a third-party candidate for governor after Republicans aligned with Gov. Bruce Rauner declined to challenge his candidacy. Monday marked the deadline to dispute the validity of candidate petitions with the Illinois State Board of Elections. But a spokesman for the Illinois Republican Party said the group decided not to pursue a challenge after a review found McCann had reached the 25,000 signatures needed to qualify. McCann, a Republican from central Illinois, is running for governor under the new banner of the Conservative Party.
Yet people usually have a gut sense of which has been adopted. They also know which will lead to real solutions. Sayeeda Warsi, formerly the chair of the Conservative party, has demanded that it launch a full and independent inquiry into Islamophobia (or, as she put it, a “fuck the Muslims” tendency) within the party, echoing a call from the Muslim Council of Britain. Lady Warsi, the MCB and other critics point to cases including the Conservative councillor suspended after sharing an article calling Muslims “parasites” and Tory MP Bob Blackman, who retweeted a message from the founder of the English Defence League (by mistake, he says) and was a member of an Islamophobic Facebook group (to which he says he was added without his knowledge). Most damaging of all – because it was a matter of party strategy, not just the action or words of an individual – was the London mayoral campaign of Zac Goldsmith, which sought to tar Sadiq Khan as an extremist, and the subsequent attempts to justify those tactics.
Ad giant WPP PLC and its former CEO Martin Sorrell are already competing against each other. The ad holding company submitted an offer for Netherlands-based digital creative agency MediaMonks ahead of last Friday’s deadline for bids to buy the firm, according to a person familiar with the matter. A rival bid was put in by Mr. Sorrell’s new venture, S4 Capital, another person said. Founded in 2001, MediaMonks produces games, films and websites, often to serve the needs of advertising agencies. It employs more than 750 people and has offices in 11 countries around the world, including in Amsterdam, Dubai, New York and Mexico City.

LOUIE! Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, says it’s possible that staff for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein are monitoring his actions. ‘I’ve been told in the past there’s been great concern about who I saw, what I did and that I was being monitored and was even told they know everybody that walks in your office,’ Gohmert said Monday in an interview on Fox Business’s ‘Lou Dobbs Tonight.’” (via Washington Examiner).
Five children 15 and younger were among 23 people shot during a scorching weekend in Chicago. From Friday afternoon to early Monday, 21 people were wounded and two people were killed, including a 14-year-old boy who was shot early Saturday while walking in the Washington Park neighborhood, according to police. About nine hours earlier, another 14-year-old boy was shot in the Loop. He was coming up stairs at the corner of Wabash Avenue and Wacker Drive when he was shot in the leg Friday evening, police said. Late Sunday night, three girls ages 5, 14 and 15 were shot while sitting in a parked car with their mother in the East Garfield Park neighborhood, police said.
Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
According to a Russian state media report related by Turkey’s Hurriyet Daily News , the United States is planning to send next-generation B61 nuclear gravity bombs to NATO bases in several European countries, including Turkey. The bomb is said to be compatible with F-35 joint strike fighters, which Turkey is also due to receive amid some controversy. Hurriyet describes the B61 nuclear bomb and Russia’s sour reaction to the prospect of NATO bases receiving them:
The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) and the U.S. Air Force completed two non-nuclear system qualification flight tests of the B61-12 gravity bomb on June 9 at Tonopah Test Range in Nevada, according to a June 29 statement by DOE/NNSA. The test, which was reportedly the first of its kind, was aimed at extending the B61 bomb’s service life by adapting it to next generation aircraft, including B-2A Spirit Bomber. “The B61-12 LEP will consolidate and replace the existing B61 bomb variants in the [U.S.] nuclear stockpile.
“His ruling was closer to congressional talking points than legal precedent.”
Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center, said that the center doesn’t weigh in on potential judicial appointees, but that open hostility to the agency’s mission would be cause for concern. “Obviously, it would be concerning if there was a justice that was inclined to invalidate the CFPB,” she said. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, renamed the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection under acting director Mick Mulvaney, returned nearly $12 billion to 29 million customers of financial services companies from 2011 to 2017 under its original director, Richard Cordray, an Obama appointee and former Ohio attorney general. But the CFPB’s structure — in fact, its very existence — has been a lightning rod since the agency’s inception. Opponents say not making the CFPB subject to the congressional appropriations process — it’s funded directly by the Federal Reserve — gives it unchecked power; supporters counter that having the central bank as its funding source protects the CFPB from partisan-driven attempts to starve it of resources.
Those factories are the core of an American operation that employs about 136,000 people, but they're also dependent on components sourced overseas for reasons of cost or availability. About 70 percent of the parts in a U.S.-built Camry, the country's best-selling car, come from domestic suppliers. Toyota on June 27 said that Trump's threatened 25 percent tariff on automotive imports would add $1,800 to the price of each sedan. The carmaker's warning of the dangers of tit-for-tat tariffs was just one of many. German lighting manufacturer Osram Licht's shares plunged 22 percent Thursday after it announced a weaker outlook due to trade tensions.
On this much police and activist South Side priest Michael Pfleger can agree: Saturday morning’s anti-violence march on the Dan Ryan Expressway is all about danger. Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.

WASHINGTON – If it's a holiday, it must be time for President Donald Trump to hit the golf course. Right on schedule, the presidential motorcade arrived at the Trump National Golf Club in suburban Virginia in the late morning, the middle of a day that also has the president tweeting and hosting a military-themed picnic later at the White House. As he departed the presidential mansion in the morning, Trump took to Twitter. In addition to a general salutation – "Happy Fourth of July....Our Country is doing GREAT!"

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
Fox News again dominated for the second quarter of 2018 not only in cable news, but in all of cable, while CNN landed in last place by a country mile. For the eighth straight quarter, Fox was the most-watched network in all of cable. With an average of 1.409 million total day viewers, Fox attracted nearly as many eyeballs as MSNBC and CNN combined. MSNBC averaged just 930,000 viewers, while CNN nosedived with an average of just 658,000. During primetime, Fox snagged an average of 2.447 million viewers, compared to MSNBC’s 1.736 million.
Three of the teens were named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.

Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.

Nearly 600 more retail jobs are to go in the UK as the Jacques Vert, Windsmoor and Precis department store brands are wound down by administrators. Administrators said they had failed to find a buyer for Calvetron Brands, which had been restructured following a rescue deal last summer. The business entered administration in May and had already shed more than 400 jobs before Wednesday’s announcement. The latest retail job losses come as more than 30,000 jobs are at risk in the UK following mass closure announcements by major chains including House of Fraser, New Look and Marks & Spencer. Retailers are suffering from rising costs and the switch to online shopping just as hard-pressed consumers rein in spending.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”

Though they won’t admit it, Democrats are suffering continued fallout from the arrogance of the Obama White House. Liberals are furious that President Trump will have the opportunity to appoint another justice to the Supreme Court, thus cementing a conservative majority for the foreseeable future. Moreover, liberals are upset that the Trump administration may have convinced Justice Anthony Kennedy to recently announce his retirement, viewing that effort as dirty pool. That Kennedy, age 81, is nobody’s fool – and is unlikely to have been manipulated – appears irrelevant. The real offense, which actually merits outrage from the left, is that President Obama did not convince liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to retire during the many years that Democrats controlled the Senate.
President Trump has just said in the past week he's going to raise things like Syria, like Ukraine, like the election meddling issue, really the whole range of issues between us. And I think that, in the president's mind, this is very important, because it gives him an opportunity to size up Vladimir Putin, to see where there are areas where we might make progress together and where there are areas where we may not. BRENNAN: Well, right now, Russia is blanket-bombing Southern Syria. That violates the last agreement Vladimir Putin made with President Trump. Why would he believe that he's in any way trustworthy?
Federal Reserve officials last month said they expect to keep raising interest rates and suggested that by the next year, they could be high enough that they could start slowing growth, according to minutes of their discussion released Thursday. While noting a strong economy, Fed officials appeared vigilant about emerging risks, especially trade tensions, and the dangers of an economy that might overheat. The officials noted heightened concerns from businesses about President Donald Trump's get-tough trade policies and that some executives had already scaled back future spending plans because of the uncertainty. They also said they were monitoring changes in market-set interest rates. A narrowing in the gap between short-term and long-term rates has been an accurate predictor of downturns in the past.

Dec. 7, 2016: Trump announces that Pruitt will be his nominee for EPA administrator
The then-Attorney General of Oklahoma was touted by Trump as having "great qualifications and a good record." Part of that record was Pruitt touting himself as a "leading advocate against the EPA's activist agenda," and his history of challenging the EPA was well known. Feb. 17, 2017: Confirmed by the Senate
Pruitt's confirmation, which was approved with a vote of 52-46, came in the midst of a court order that required him to turn over thousands of communications with major coal, oil and gas companies from his time in office. Democratic senators expressed outrage that Republicans were going ahead as scheduled with the vote on Pruitt, despite the judge’s ruling in the order.

Abbott said on Tuesday night he never conceived of climate change as a moral challenge. “It was an issue, that’s all, and – at least on the actual changes we’ve so far seen – not a very significant one compared to man’s inhumanity to man; maintaining and improving living standards; and even to many other environmental issues such as degraded bush and waterways, particulate pollution, water quality in the third world, deforestation and urban overcrowding.”
He contended that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide from roughly 300 to 400 parts per million over the last century had not triggered “dramatic consequences”. Play Video 0:32 Andrew Probyn calls Tony Abbott 'destructive' in ABC report – video
“Storms are not more severe; droughts are not more prolonged; floods are not greater; and fires are not more intense than a century ago – despite hyperventilating reportage and over-the-top claims from Green politicians,” he said. “Sea levels have hardly risen and temperatures are still below those of the medieval warm period.

It was no surprise to read that the very first lesson you suggest could be learned from overseas (Five things the NHS could do to improve service, 3 July) is the establishment of integrated health and social care, as has happened in New Zealand. The achievements of the Attlee government are at the heart of my socialist beliefs but the compromises which led then to the split between free NHS care and means-tested social care remain the achilles heel as the NHS celebrates 70 years. It is utterly ludicrous to have separate systems which imply distinct and neat boundaries between health and care, with rather a lot of people making a good living arguing on which side of the fence some poor demented soul belongs. Disputes around the funding of continuing care have become a major industry. The recent NHS funding announcement, making no reference whatsoever to social care, evidenced the fact that the government still hasn’t the least idea of how the two are umbilically linked.
Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) trashed the June jobs report — even though it showed rapid job growth, rising wages, and low unemployment. The report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that employers created 213,000 new jobs in June — 22,000 more than economists had expected. Manufacturing jobs in particular rose by 36,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.

3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.

In other cities, rising salaries would be a boon to public coffers, but, Seattle is burdened with one of the most regressive tax systems in the country. With no income tax, the financing of public works falls more heavily on the less well off through sales and property taxes. “We have a tax system in which if you’re making less than $25,000, you’re paying about 18% of your income in state and local taxes.

It's a problem that's always there. "For a good few years we did see a decrease in the number of young people reportedly taking substances. "But over the last 12 to 18 months we have seen a slight increase."
Sen. Susan Collins speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, June 21. | AP Photo Collins: New justice should not favor overturning Roe v. Wade
Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Sunday that President Donald Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court should not seek to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that enshrined abortion rights in the United States. “Roe v. Wade is a constitutional right that is well-established,” Collins said on “State of the Union” on CNN. “And no less an authority than Chief Justice [John] Roberts said that repeatedly at his confirmation hearing.“

Trump last week said he wouldn’t ask potential Supreme Court nominees about abortion rights — a departure from his stance on the campaign trail, when he said he would only nominate justices to the Supreme Court who oppose abortion. “I think what he said as the candidate may not have been informed by the legal advice that he now has,” Collins told Jake Tapper.
The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.
Corporate America couldn’t hire Republican lobbyists fast enough after President Donald Trump’s election gave the GOP unified control of Washington. Now there are signs that Democrats are back in demand. Companies and trade groups are trying to hire congressional staffers with ties to influential House Democrats four months ahead of the midterm elections, in which Democrats are expected to pick up seats and potentially retake control of the House. Lobbyists are helping their clients meet with the Democrats who would become committee chairs if the party does win back the chamber. And trade groups are talking to members about what to expect from a Democratic takeover.
There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void. In New Jersey, this is compounded by the fact that the state is located between two big cities, New York and Philadelphia, that are in other states. The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.
Health policy experts say one flaw with the administration’s plan is the lack of any serious follow through. | REUTERS Drugmakers defy Trump's call to drop prices
President Donald Trump in May said that drugmakers would soon announce “massive” price cuts, and his administration rolled out a plan to bring down the cost of medicines. But the companies don’t appear to have gotten that message. Bayer raised the price of two cancer drugs by hundreds of dollars in May and Novartis followed by boosting four pricey treatments in June. Pfizer, one of the largest U.S. pharmaceutical companies, announced increases on more than 41 products this week.

Yes, but it’s not that bad. Yes, but women are taking it too far.

Avenatti's former law firm, Eagan Avenatti LLP, agreed to make the roughly $452,000 tax payment last month in order to resolve a bankruptcy case, but the funds never arrived at the IRS, according to a filing Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, Calif.

4/ WUNDERBAR An EU deal to share out refugees on a voluntary basis and create “controlled centres” to process asylum requests has thrown a lifeline to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose coalition government has been teetering on the brink of collapse. Bavaria’s Christian Social Union meets on Sunday to decide whether that deal addresses its concerns. If not, it could make good on a promise to unilaterally introduce tougher immigration controls, potentially shattering its alliance with Merkel’s Christian Democrats and toppling her three-month-old government.
"The president of the republic and his government will be absolutely respectful and support the authorities that are elected," Pena Nieto told reporters. Hovering over the election is the specter of vote fraud, though electoral officials deny it is a possibility with the modern balloting technology and institutions now in place. In both of Lopez Obrador's previous two presidential losses he alleged fraud. In his first loss — by a mere 0.56 percent to conservative Felipe Calderon in 2006 — his supporters held months-long protests in Mexico City and he referred to himself as "the legitimate president." His allies are warning even before Sunday's presidential vote that there better not be any funny business.
The problem is so pervasive that a lawmaker recently asked El Salvador's Legislative Assembly for national identity cards to be issued without addresses "to save lives." Fifteen years ago, the Salvadoran government began a crackdown on gangs, resulting in thousands of members being imprisoned. Yet they continued to proliferate, even running operations with cell phones from behind bars. El Salvador's defense minister said in 2015 there were 60,000 gang members in the country, compared to a combined police and army strength of 50,000. Members of those security forces contribute to the violence that is causing the northward migration.

Authorities in Oregon are urging hikers and other outdoors enthusiasts to avoid forested areas near the Oregon-California border, where a blaze has killed one person. The Jackson County Sheriff's Office said Friday that although the blaze has not crossed into Oregon, officials are concerned people in remote areas could be unreachable in case they need to quickly evacuate. It says the areas of concern include the Pacific Crest Trail, Mount Ashland and the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument.

It was described as a tense meeting, the BBC's Norman Smith said. Mrs May is trying to find an arrangement to unite her cabinet when ministers gather at her country retreat, Chequers, on Friday. The UK is leaving the EU in March 2019, but has yet to agree how it will trade with the remaining EU members - who are part of a single market and a customs union - in years to come. Some former Remain campaigners want the government to pursue close ties to the EU to avoid barriers to trade with Europe - but Eurosceptics say the UK needs freedom to set its own independent trade policy. After two alternative models for customs were criticised, Downing Street has come up with what it calls a "third way" solution to be presented on Friday, claiming it will offer "the best of both worlds" - frictionless trade with Europe and the freedom to strike international trade deals.
Over the fireplace at Mingo Creek Craft Distillers, a whiskey purveyor in the small town of Washington, Pennsylvania, a portrait of Alexander Hamilton hangs upside down. With snowy hair and a black velvet jacket, Hamilton wears an impassive look that might be described as hauteur. In 1791, to pay off debts the newly formed United States incurred during the revolutionary war, Hamilton imposed the first federal tax on the people of the region. By taxing their most lucrative product, whiskey, he became what he is here today: a villain representing the excesses of the federal government. The town of Washington is only a six-hour drive from Manhattan, but it’s a world away from the Broadway stage where Hamilton, clad in snug white knickers, enjoys a better reputation.
"Jon's record is clear—if it's good for Montana, Jon works with anyone from either party to get things done. If it's bad for Montana, he'll stand up to anyone," Tester spokesman Chris Meagher said. "East Coast developer Matt Rosendale is only looking out for himself and whatever out-of-state special interest group that is propping up his campaign with cash. We can't trust him to defend Montana." But before Trump arrived in Montana, Tester's campaign took out full-page ads in newspapers across the state, highlighting bills the senator sponsored that Trump has signed into law.
He was, in other words, beginning to sound more like his tweets, and perhaps just a bit like Donald Trump. Brennan’s father, Owen, was a blacksmith who immigrated to New Jersey from Ireland in 1948.

Brennan moved twice while growing up, from one apartment to another before settling in a three-family house in North Bergen. His grandmother lived on the top floor.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.

The report also said that Strzok repeatedly pushed for more aggressive action in the Clinton probe. "The conduct by these employees cast a cloud over the entire FBI investigation and sowed doubt about the FBI’s work," the report concluded. "The damage caused by these employees’ actions extends far beyond the scope of the (Clinton) investigation and goes to the heart of the FBI’s reputation for neutral fact finding and political independence." Goelman, in an op-ed in USA TODAY last month, said Strzok has become the victim of "political gamesmanship" by Congress and President Trump, who has repeatedly tweeted about Strzok as evidence of bias by the FBI and Justice Department. "They have spent months cynically taking these texts out of context and saying that one- or two-word snippets somehow prove that the FBI investigations of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the Russia probe itself, were biased," Goelman wrote.

Nebraska May Join Utah, Idaho in Putting Medicaid Expansion Before Voters

Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.
NEW YORK — House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) has referred 15 individuals, including longtime Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal, for possible “open setting” testimony in the ongoing Russia investigation. The list was sent to House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA). Many of the names are tied to the discredited anti-Trump dossier produced by the controversial Fusion GPS firm, which was paid for its dossier work by both Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) via the Perkins Coie lawfirm. Indeed, Perkins Coie attorney Marc E. Elias, who reportedly was involved in arranging the payments that resulted in the dossier, made the Nunes list. As did Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson.
Straight-A students are being turned away from British medical schools and forced to pay for training in Eastern Europe, while the National Health Service (NHS) plunders the Third World for already-trained doctors instead. The Daily Mail spoke to a number of star students who earned top A-levels and supplemented their CVs with spells volunteering at local GP surgeries, overseas clinics, hospices, and pharmacies — and even earned degrees in related fields such as Biomedical Science — who were turned away from British medical schools, despite the NHS facing a shortfall of some 10,000 doctors. Department of Health and Social Care figures show that only 6,000 of 18,000 medical school applicants were awarded places last year — with many of the 6,000 likely going to foreign applicants, who have often been favoured over British applicants. In fact, the Mail found that so many talented would-be medical students were being rejected that a cottage industry of English-language medical schools in countries such as Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Armenia, and Georgia have sprung up to cater to them — but even this option is not available to youngsters who cannot afford the fees.

Eric Young, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees’ Council of Prison Locals, now prays before he looks at his phone every morning, worried he’ll receive a message from BOP’s director notifying him of a staff death. Young estimates that around two-thirds of his union members were Trump supporters. That makes sense: It’s a law enforcement agency that leans white and male (72 percent male, 62 percent white), and many federal prisons are in rural parts of the country, which Trump dominated. But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau. BOP has long suffered the kind of problems you’d expect for a massive bureaucracy centered on caging tens of thousands of people.
Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
That will allow Trump to argue that his tough approach to trade is paying off. There are reasons why the US economy is currently strong, but none of them have anything to do with tariffs on imports. In part, it is the lagged effect of a buoyant global economy in 2017; in part it is explained by tax cuts and the stimulus still being provided by only gently rising interest rates. Mickey Levy, chief US economist for Berenberg, says Trump’s deregulation agenda has been a factor in boosting America’s underlying growth rate. Evidence from Barack Obama’s presidency shows how protectionist policies can backfire.
He said he supports the project and wants to see it succeed “more than anybody.”

"Cohen added: 'Once I understand what charges might be filed against me, if any at all, I will defer to my new counsel, Guy Petrillo, for guidance.' Story Continued Below
"But when I pointed out to Cohen that he wasn’t repeating past vows to 'take a bullet' and 'do anything' to protect the president, the longtime Trump loyalist left little doubt about where he stands now, saying simply: 'To be crystal clear, my wife, my daughter and my son, and this country have my first loyalty.'
Delivering a speech in Newcastle on Thursday, he said: “At the moment, protectionism is largely just talk (and tweets). But what if rhetoric becomes reality?”
Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.
Hamilton, the Republican state lawmaker who beat the incumbent Karnes, won with a mix of support from teachers and other unions.

The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona.

Cult activities escalated after the defeat of Aum members in the 1990 parliamentary election. During their bizarre election campaign, Asahara and his top disciples sang and danced to the guru's songs. In June 1994, the cult spread sarin gas in Matsumoto in central Japan, killing eight people and injuring more than 140 others, in an attack targeting residents who were protesting the cult's presence in their neighborhood and court officials handling their legal disputes. Nakagawa and key members produced sarin at a cult compound and sprayed it from a van, in what was later regarded as an experiment for the subsequent subway gassing. Under intensifying scrutiny from the government, the cult plotted the larger sarin attack on the subways in Tokyo on March 20, 1995.

The United States accused Madriz of ordering the Nicaraguan police to set fire to a house in the capital, Managua, killing six people, including two children. It said police also asked gang leaders in Nicaragua to attack anti-government protesters, fired on and killed peaceful protesters. Briones ordered attacks against elderly and young people protesting peacefully, ordered violent attacks against anti-government marchers and beat protesters and stole money from Managua municipal projects, according to the Treasury.
You've got to look at every issue from all sides." "I really have been pleasantly surprised how willing he is to tell Chuck Schumer to go fly a kite," she added, referring to the Senate minority leader. At other times, however, Jones has taken up liberal positions seen as risky for a Democratic senator from a GOP state. He aligned himself with most of his Democratic colleagues against Gina Haspel, Trump's pick for CIA director, arguing that her record on enhanced interrogation techniques was unacceptable. And instead of focusing on a politically safe issue in his maiden Senate floor speech, Jones struck a nerve by calling for a dialogue on gun violence after the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida.
About four years ago, Dais had lined up a Chinese company to help develop its business in nanotechnology that helps produce clean water. Tangredi said the Chinese company persuaded a long-time Dais employee to defect with trade secrets. "They just stole it, and they are using it against us," he said. Tangredi said he hopes the threat of a trade war will force China to rethink its practices: "You've got to do something to get their attention."
These numbers are similar to those from a February Quinnipiac poll, where 49 percent of voters said Trump was racist and 46 percent said he was not. Forty-four percent of voters said they think “racist beliefs” were a motive in Trump’s immigration policy, while 50 percent said Trump has “a sincere interest in controlling our borders.” Sixty percent said the policy of separating children from their parents at the border was a violation of human rights. Since enacting the policy, Trump and his associates have repeatedly pushed false, racist narratives to garner support, often associating immigration with high crime rates despite no evidence to support claims that immigrants commit more crime than U.S. citizens. While only 11 percent of Republican voters in the Quinnipiac poll said they think Trump is a racist, 22 percent said they believe Trump has emboldened racist people to express their beliefs publicly. The number of hate crimes rose the year Trump was elected ― the first increase in over a decade.
And then you have the old guard, like Pelosi and others at the top. And there is no overall messaging that is bringing that all together. That's why these arguments like abolish ICE start catching fire, because there's no other counter message out there from the Democrats--

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.
Straight-A students are being turned away from British medical schools and forced to pay for training in Eastern Europe, while the National Health Service (NHS) plunders the Third World for already-trained doctors instead. The Daily Mail spoke to a number of star students who earned top A-levels and supplemented their CVs with spells volunteering at local GP surgeries, overseas clinics, hospices, and pharmacies — and even earned degrees in related fields such as Biomedical Science — who were turned away from British medical schools, despite the NHS facing a shortfall of some 10,000 doctors. Department of Health and Social Care figures show that only 6,000 of 18,000 medical school applicants were awarded places last year — with many of the 6,000 likely going to foreign applicants, who have often been favoured over British applicants. In fact, the Mail found that so many talented would-be medical students were being rejected that a cottage industry of English-language medical schools in countries such as Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Armenia, and Georgia have sprung up to cater to them — but even this option is not available to youngsters who cannot afford the fees.

In their statement, Mr Netanyahu and Mr Morawiecki praised the Polish wartime government-in-exile, saying it tried to "raise awareness among Western allies of the systematic murder" of Polish Jews. They also said structures of the Polish underground state supervised by the Polish government-in-exile "created a mechanism of systematic help and support to Jewish people". However Yad Vashem said this contradicted decades of historical research and contained "grave errors and deceptions". It said much of the Polish resistance in its various movements "not only failed to help Jews, but was also not infrequently actively involved in persecuting them". Polish assistance to Jews during the Holocaust was "relatively rare", Yad Vashem said, and "attacks against and even the murder of Jews were widespread".
Any amount of prescription opioid use was correlated with greater involvement. Among people with prescription opioid use disorder, nearly 20 percent had criminal justice involvement. For heroin users, it was 40 percent. "People who use opioids, including heroin, were up to 13 times more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system," says Winkelman. The study shows the complexity of the the opioid crisis, according to Josiah Rich, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Brown University, who wasn't involved in the research.
Circuit by President George W. Bush. "Rather, the issuance of injunctive relief in this case serves only to hold Defendants accountable to their own governing policies and to ensure that Plaintiffs receive the protections they are due under the Parole Directive." The lawsuits was filed in March by legal groups representing nine jailed asylum-seekers. The plaintiffs include an ethics teacher from Haiti who was attacked after teaching his class about government corruption, a Venezuelan who was threatened for participating in marches opposing the country's communist government, and a gay Honduran man who was threatened at gunpoint. One has been held in U.S. custody for over two years.
A second book, "Six Amendments: How and Why We Should Change the Constitution," followed in 2014. One of the amendments the liberal justice proposed revising was the Second Amendment. Stevens returned to the topic again this year. After marches following the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, in which 17 people died, Stevens wrote an essay for The New York Times calling not only for significant gun control legislation but also the Second Amendment's repeal. What issues, if any, Kennedy might speak out on are an open question, though he's spoken harshly in the past about solitary confinement.

Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
But sex-worker-rights campaigners say the proposal would be "a disaster". Three organisations - the Sex Worker Advocacy and Resistance Movement (Swarm), the English Collective of Prostitutes (ECP), and the xTalk collective - are planning a demonstration outside Parliament at the time of this Wednesday's debate to protest against the suggested law change. They describe the idea as being a "Trump-inspired" effort to kick sex workers off the internet and put them into "more exploitative and harmful situations". New platforms
The debate follows an official report into sexual exploitation in England and Wales, which was published in May. It concluded that prostitution procurement websites were "the most significant enabler of sex-trafficking in the UK".

Belfast City Council has become the first council in Northern Ireland to set up a committee specifically to deal with Brexit. The idea was proposed earlier this year, and membership of the committee was confirmed at the council's monthly meeting on Monday night. It will be responsible for "researching, monitoring and reviewing the financial, resource or operational impact" of Brexit on Belfast. Its first meeting will be on 9 August. While the UK as a whole voted to leave the EU in June 2016, a majority in Northern Ireland voted to remain.
However, they admit it will produce power only about 11 per cent of the time. The output of the nearby Medway gas-fired power station is 735MW, but this is continuous. If the British government has any sense it will give this green vanity project the same treatment it did to the similarly stupid Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon Project and pull the plug before any more taxpayers’ money is poured down the drain. Unfortunately, though, the decision is in the hands of Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Greg Clark. Clark, a passionate Europhile, also happens to be the dreariest and most drippingly wet Conservative in Theresa May’s cabinet.

Teddy Roosevelt hopped on whistle stop tour after whistle stop tour where he was able to drop into rural and suburban communities alike to deliver short, pre-packaged speeches that local papers would usually print verbatim. (He left them short on purpose for that very reason.) Franklin Roosevelt revolutionized and heightened the stature of the office with his fireside chats, that brought his message over the heads of the pesky press corps and directly into the living rooms of the American people. But, though it would have been seen as a scoop, even the reporters covering Lyndon B. Johnson had the good sense not to report on every turd he dropped in their presence. While the founders envisioned a government that moved slowly and methodically, today’s Wi-Fi-enabled political discourse is demanding the opposite.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.

The University of Missouri is still facing enrollment and budgetary problems, including a $49 million budget shortfall, as a result of the 2015 social justice protests that caught national media attention. Many people remember the high-pitched yell of former University of Missouri professor Melissa Click. Click found herself at the center of weeks of unrest at the University of Missouri in 2015 and 2016. Click rose to infamy after a video of her calling for a student photojournalist to be physically removed from campus simply because he was documenting the protests. The protests involved accusations by students that the administration had mishandled several alleged racial issues on campus.

A judge ordered federal emergency officials to extend vouchers for temporary hotel housing for nearly 1,700 Puerto Rican hurricane evacuees, saying ending the program could cause irreparable harm. Saturday night's decision came shortly after civil rights group LatinoJustice PRLDEF filed a lawsuit seeking relief for the Puerto Ricans, whose federal housing assistance vouchers were set to expire at midnight Sunday, meaning the evacuees could have been evicted from the hotels. The order says the agency cannot end its Transitional Sheltering Assistance program until at least midnight on Tuesday. The organization is pushing to let families stay another six months. U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin of Massachusetts wrote that ending the program would drain other public resources.
Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.
It introduced tariff changes in 2017 which are the subject of a legal challenge by boiler owners. Image caption The RHI inquiry was set up to investigate the circumstances surrounding the scheme after its costs spiralled
The cost-cutting measures included the introduction of a much less generous tiered-tariff and a cap on the number of hours eligible for subsidy. The cap was fixed at 400,000kwh - equivalent to a 99kw boiler running 11 hours a day, 365 days a year. Prior to the cap, 659 RHI boilers ran for longer than this. Since its introduction, that number has fallen to 118.
Spencer Platt via Getty Images Volunteers help walk dozens of women and their children, many fleeing poverty and violence in Honduras, Guatamala and El Salvador, to a relief center following their release from Customs and Border Protection on June 22, 2018 in McAllen, Texas. Once women migrants cross the border into the United States, they risk losing their children and may struggle to get a hold of basic necessities, like clean underwear and menstrual hygiene products. In addition to offering help with obtaining asylum, nonprofits and immigration attorneys offer these women a safe space where they can have some time to focus on their own needs, instead of just the needs of their children. “The journey has been so treacherous for some,” said Brenda Riojas, communications director for Catholic Charities Respite Center, a McAllen, Texas-based group that caters to migrants who were freed from detention and need a place to regroup before connecting with relatives. “Because we have so many volunteers, they can trust somebody to watch their children.

LONDON — Over the past century American and British troops have fought side-by-side in two World Wars, Korea and the conflicts in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan. But some lawmakers and experts in the United Kingdom are warning that the British military could soon be seen as irrelevant by the United States unless it receives a colossal funding boost. "There is a concern that the U.K. is falling ever further behind and becoming even more useless from a U.S. point of view," said Andrew Dorman, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a think tank in London.
Trump’s chaos theory of running companies is now on full display in the West Wing, but it’s also on display in the rest of us. He’s the made himself the center of our universe, and most of us are now unwittingly circling his orbit. It’s time for every Trump critic in cyberspace to pause, take a deep breath (or five) and put the salesman-turned-president in proper perspective. The founders wanted a government of the people, but they never said we had to tweet at the president’s level. He’s merely today’s shiniest, (though ever-fading) object and in reality represents nothing new.
WASHINGTON -- Ahead of next week's NATO summit in Brussels, President Trump sent a letter to the prime minister of Norway that made clear he will not relent on his criticism of NATO allies' lagging defense budgets. Norway, the president wrote, "remains the only NATO ally sharing a border with Russia that lacks a credible plan to spend 2 percent of its gross domestic product on defense." Norway is far from alone as a target of criticism -- the president has reportedly sent similar letters to other countries. Of the 28 NATO nations, only three besides the U.S. spent the promised 2 percent of GDP on defense last year. Throughout his presidency, Mr. Trump has prodded NATO nations to spend more.
As well as a new president, Mexican will be voting for 128 senators and 500 deputies in Congress as well as state and local officials. In all, 88 million people will be eligible to vote. Mexico is the second largest economy in Latin America and a major oil exporter. However, oil prices have dropped and the Mexican currency, the peso, has fallen sharply against the dollar. More than 40% of the population lives in poverty and high levels of corruption and violence have led some companies to pull out of the worst affected areas.

The United States has always been both a major producer and consumer of oil, which means that most presidents have favored moderate oil prices. High prices hurt motorists and oil consumers across the country.
There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void. In New Jersey, this is compounded by the fact that the state is located between two big cities, New York and Philadelphia, that are in other states. The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.
It has nothing to do with “basic human decency”, so it is far easier to scapegoat a junior producer than admit the program was working entirely as planned. A day later, the hosts issued an on-air apology, saying the senator had crossed a line and seeking to disassociate themselves from “unverified rumour and innuendo” about Hanson-Young’s private life. They had no such scruples during the interview, that went on for more than 17 minutes. It would be wrong to say this incident proves that Australia is struggling with the #MeToo movement and what it might mean, although it is. Australia has a blokey culture, and there is considerable backlash to revelations of the ubiquity of sexual harassment, whether low level or more serious.

• Sonia Sodha argues (Opinion, 4 July) that to safeguard the future of the NHS we should join up NHS and social care budgets and extend the NHS’s free-to-all principle to social care . The barrier between the budgets for health and social care is unhelpful and the Barker commission on the future of health and social care recommended a single, ring-fenced budget covering both, with spending gradually rising as a proportion of GDP to bring us into line with countries such as France and Germany. This increase, while significant, is affordable if we are prepared to make hard choices about taxation and spending.

They are to consult on detailed plans to restrict the promotion and marketing of foods high in salt, sugar and fat. This would target confectionary, biscuits, crisps, cakes, pastries, sugary soft drinks and potentially ice creams, and include restrictions on multi-buy offers, meal deals, unlimited refill deals and where products can be displayed in shops. Newly appointed public health minister Joe Fitzpatrick said "far too many people" were facing "serious risks to their health" which were "largely avoidable". 'Profound impact'
The new government report states that "the Scottish diet remains stubbornly unhealthy", with the country "far from meeting our dietary goals" - something which has a "profound" impact on health and lifestyle. Problems start early, with the report setting out "alarming" findings on the number of children consuming food and drinks high in fat or sugar - studies suggest 29% of children are at risk of being overweight, half of whom are at risk of obesity.

The US president, Donald Trump, reversed the policy of family separations late last month, replacing it with indefinite family detention, but it is unknown how many of the nearly 3,000 children who were separated from their parents have been reunited with their parents or deported alone.
Trump said Sunday that he would "probably" not ask his Supreme Court pick how they would vote on the Roe v. Wade legal precedent during an interview with Fox News. But he added that abortion rights "could very well end up" being determined on a state-by-state basis after his pick is confirmed. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who beat a senior House Democrat from New York in a primary last week, called on Democrats to stiffen their backbone on the court fight. "The messaging isn't as clear to the communities that we're trying to represent," she said. "Are we fighting, or not?"

From Friday afternoon to early Monday, 21 people were wounded and two people were killed, including a 14-year-old boy who was shot early Saturday while walking in the Washington Park neighborhood, according to police. About nine hours earlier, another 14-year-old boy was shot in the Loop. He was coming up stairs at the corner of Wabash Avenue and Wacker Drive when he was shot in the leg Friday evening, police said. Late Sunday night, three girls ages 5, 14 and 15 were shot while sitting in a parked car with their mother in the East Garfield Park neighborhood, police said.

— MINING: The EPA said last year that it won't require mining companies to prove they have the financial resources to clean up pollution, an Obama-era rule stemming from a long history of pollution spilling from abandoned mines into streams. Pruitt said modern mining practices and existing regulations made the financial requirement unnecessary and a burden on mining. — AUTOS: Pruitt's EPA has proposed freezing vehicle fuel-efficiency standards at 2020 levels for the next five years, according to a draft of the proposal obtained by Sen.

Just before the tariff deadline, President Donald Trump upped the ante, warning that the United States may ultimately target over $500 billion worth of Chinese goods, or roughly the total amount of U.S. imports from China last year.
Nebraska May Join Utah, Idaho in Putting Medicaid Expansion Before Voters
Enlarge this image toggle caption Fred Knapp/NET News Fred Knapp/NET News
Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.
The major U.S. stock indexes were mostly higher in early trading Friday following a solid jobs report, keeping the market on track for a weekly gain after two weeks of losses. The modest gains came despite an escalation in global trade tensions as the U.S. imposed tariffs on billions in Chinese goods and China responded in kind. Health care stocks posted the biggest gains, led by Biogen. The drugmaker's stock soared 18 percent to $353.28 on encouraging results from an Alzheimer's therapy. Industrials companies took some of the biggest losses.

XI ASSERTS TERRITORIAL CLAIMS IN MEETING WITH US DEFENSE SECRETARY
Chinese President Xi Jinping strongly asserted China's determination to defend territory it claims, including in the South China Sea, in a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. While the tone of Mattis' visit to Beijing was largely upbeat, Xi made sure to reinforce his reputation as a fervent nationalist when it comes to issues of sovereignty. Though Xi gave no specifics in his statement, he was largely seen as indicating the South China Sea as well as self-governing Taiwan. China also claims territory held by India and uninhabited East China Sea islands controlled by Japan.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.
When people hear the way I speak, they’re usually like, ‘uhh, this is not what I thought. We thought you were just about peace and holding hands!’ Ieshia Evans
“I’ve had people who see the picture, and they have this idea in their head of who they want me to be,” she said. “And when they get a glimpse of who I actually am, they don’t like it.”
The story in the photo of a mother compelled to venture out-of-state and risk arrest in support of a cause she held dear had captivated many. But Evans says some of the attention painted an incorrect picture of her. “People saw me and kept championing the ‘peaceful protest,’ and that’s fine,” Evans said.

Russian forces loyal to dictator Bashar al-Assad killed the son of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the chief of the crumbling Islamic State, while he was hiding in a cave in Syria, Iraqi intelligence agents claimed Thursday. This week’s death of Hudhayfah al-Badri potentially deprives Baghdadi of an heir. Although they do not agree on the circumstances surrounding his death, Iraqi intelligence and Islamic State have confirmed that Hudhayfah al-Badri, Baghdadi’s son, is indeed dead. “The U.S. military said it had seen the reports of al-Badri’s death but declined any confirmation,” Voice of America conceded on Wednesday. Islamic State’s feeble presence in Iraq and Syria, once home to its now annihilated so-called caliphate, has been squeezed into ever-shrinking pockets of territory mainly located along the border dividing the two countries.
Last June witnessed 1,901,768 checks, which was the second best June on record until this year. Background check numbers have been increasing in the wake of the gun control push that followed the Parkland school shooting. That horrific shooting occurred on February 14, 2018, and Breitbart News reported that March, April, and May 2018 all broke records for the most background checks in their respective months. Membership in gun rights’ organizations has surged since the Parkland shooting as well. The NRA now has six million members and the Second Amendment Foundation (SAF) witnessed a 1,200% increase in members aged 18-20.
Hamilton, the Republican state lawmaker who beat the incumbent Karnes, won with a mix of support from teachers and other unions. While Karnes sparred with teachers during the strike, Hamilton took a moderate position. He aligned with teachers unions by opposing state right-to-work legislation and the proposed repeal of prevailing wage laws for public construction projects. The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.
Nonfarm payrolls surged by 223,000 jobs during that month as warm weather bolstered hiring at construction sites. June’s data is expected to show a 200,000 increase, according to a Reuters poll.

About four years ago, Dais had lined up a Chinese company to help develop its business in nanotechnology that helps produce clean water. Tangredi said the Chinese company persuaded a long-time Dais employee to defect with trade secrets. "They just stole it, and they are using it against us," he said. Tangredi said he hopes the threat of a trade war will force China to rethink its practices: "You've got to do something to get their attention."
This was particularly an issue for Pruitt’s former executive scheduler Sydney Hupp, who often had to shell out for Pruitt’s trips. Hupp was also asked by Pruitt to speak with staff at one of Trump’s hotels, believing he could get a deal on a second-hand mattress they were selling. Pruitt remained miserly even when he was abusing his position to get a good deal. He fell behind on the rental payments on the condo he was getting on the cheap and eventually had to be evicted and the locks were changed.

Bishop John Bauerschmidt, who oversees the Middle Tennessee region of the church, stands firmly by his decision not to authorize their use, nor allow clergy within his diocese to officiate the religious ceremonies or permit the weddings on church property. In doing so, the bishop says he is being faithful to his job of guarding the discipline, faith and unity of the church.

"The teaching that Christian marriage is between a man and a woman is reasonable, traditional, and scriptural," Bauerschmidt said in an email. "There really is nothing remarkable about a Christian bishop who holds to this teaching." While Bishops can place limitations on the use of the marriage liturgies, they must refer couples to a willing diocese if they do not authorize them.
This is just terrible timing all around." Medicaid, an $11 billion, state-federal health plan in Kentucky, covers 1.4 million people, about 600,000 of them children. The federal government provides about 80 percent of the state's Medicaid funds. The cuts to dental and vision benefits were supposed to affect only able-bodied adults, mostly those added to Medicaid under an expansion authorized through the Affordable Care Act.
In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners. Alas, he is wasting his time trying to shift the views of the Democratic Party, which has become ever more left-wing, if not outright socialist. I think it is time for Mr. James to become a Republican. Guy Randolph

It’s shocking that Mr. James is surprised by the positive economic results of less regulation and lower taxes.

Asian markets appear to have taken in stride the U.S. move to raise tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese products. Just after the increase was due to take effect at midnight Friday Washington time, major benchmarks in China, Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea were steady. The lack of any dramatic reaction suggests many market players have already factored the escalation in trade tensions into their trading strategies.

Pentagon Questioned Over Blackout On War Zone Troop Numbers
Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images
For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.

This account of the previously undisclosed conversation comes from a senior administration official familiar with what was said. In an exchange that lasted around five minutes, McMaster and others took turns explaining to Trump how military action could backfire and risk losing hard-won support among Latin American governments to punish President Nicolas Maduro for taking Venezuela down the path of dictatorship, according to the official. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the discussions. Although he gave no indication he was about to order up military plans, he pointed to what he considered past cases of successful gunboat diplomacy in the region, according to the official, like the invasions of Panama and Grenada in the 1980s.

LONDON, July 2 (Reuters) - China’s yuan fell to its lowest level against the U.S. dollar since mid-August on Monday, as investors become increasingly worries a growing trade conflict between Beijing and Washington will squeeze the Chinese economy. The yuan, traded in offshore markets, fell 0.9 percent on the day, its biggest one-day drop since January 2017, to 6.6925 yuan per dollar. The Chinese currency suffered its worst ever month against the dollar in June, and is now down almost 5 percent since the middle of last month. Chinese stocks have also taken a battering, with the Shanghai bourse hitting over two-year lows in an ominous start to July, days before U.S. tariffs on Chinese exports are due to take effect. The dollar is also rallying broadly and is up 0.5 percent on the day against a basket of currencies.
Not providing the same enhanced Central opportunities at South has led to a diminishing student population, and less demand for housing at South versus the opposite effect at Central. A significant positive remedy to the filed discrimination complaint would include a one campus system: one campus for freshmen and sophomores, and the other campus for juniors and seniors. Will the board of education continue to allow socioeconomic and racial discrimination and segregation, or unify both resident and student populations? The impartial answer is unification. However, the elitist population of District 86 will negatively resist any such answer.
The report also said that Strzok repeatedly pushed for more aggressive action in the Clinton probe. "The conduct by these employees cast a cloud over the entire FBI investigation and sowed doubt about the FBI’s work," the report concluded. "The damage caused by these employees’ actions extends far beyond the scope of the (Clinton) investigation and goes to the heart of the FBI’s reputation for neutral fact finding and political independence." Goelman, in an op-ed in USA TODAY last month, said Strzok has become the victim of "political gamesmanship" by Congress and President Trump, who has repeatedly tweeted about Strzok as evidence of bias by the FBI and Justice Department. "They have spent months cynically taking these texts out of context and saying that one- or two-word snippets somehow prove that the FBI investigations of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the Russia probe itself, were biased," Goelman wrote.
That came on the heels of 0.9 percent drop in March, the first monthly drop since July of 2017. Total private construction rose 0.3 percent, with residential projects up 0.8 percent in May.

Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
Corporate America couldn’t hire Republican lobbyists fast enough after President Donald Trump’s election gave the GOP unified control of Washington. Now there are signs that Democrats are back in demand. Companies and trade groups are trying to hire congressional staffers with ties to influential House Democrats four months ahead of the midterm elections, in which Democrats are expected to pick up seats and potentially retake control of the House. Lobbyists are helping their clients meet with the Democrats who would become committee chairs if the party does win back the chamber. And trade groups are talking to members about what to expect from a Democratic takeover.

How will he behave toward those members of his very odd coalition is anyone’s guess.

He aligned himself with most of his Democratic colleagues against Gina Haspel, Trump's pick for CIA director, arguing that her record on enhanced interrogation techniques was unacceptable. And instead of focusing on a politically safe issue in his maiden Senate floor speech, Jones struck a nerve by calling for a dialogue on gun violence after the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida. In addition, during the campaign, Jones made no secret of his desire to protect LGBTQ rights and to support a woman's right to abortion. It's those kinds of positions that have made him a darling of Alabama's progressive minority — and somewhat of a public enemy among the state's conservative majority. Jones has introduced four pieces of legislation — none of any huge significance — since he arrived on Capitol Hill, including two agriculture bills, one that would expand access to capital for rural job creators and the last seeking to mandate an annual Medicaid expansion review.
Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop.

“Some of these articles feature exaggerations or overgeneraliszations [sic]; for example, some claim that China is ‘world No.1’ in certain field.”
The problem with these pieces, the People’s Daily argued in this column, is that “they lack basic facts and deep thought.”
Should Xi implement this reform in the tone of Chinese state media, it would mean a significant change for the typical styles of the nation’s largest publications. In 2017 alone, Chinese state publications proclaimed that the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse scandal proves that “Chinese traditional values” are superior to Western ones; the Soviet Union failed because it lacked “Chinese culture”; and that the West was doomed to fail because Western leaders “always believe in absolute conquest.”
An extensive profile of Xi Jinping in the state outlet Xinhua last year also went out of its way to proclaim that the world is riveted by Xi and his ability to “make things happen,” as evidenced by the “numerous clicks and many thumbs-up on the Internet” his speeches and political commentary garner. The story featured an anecdote about a man who drank some of the ink he was using to translate the Communist Manifesto because “the taste of truth is so sweet.”
Not to be left behind, in December, the People’s Daily proclaimed, “A unique path, a unique theory, a unique system, a unique culture; Xi Jinping’s thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era has developed a rich path for China that has transcended Western-centric theory.”
The growing human rights movement within China has also become one of the most common targets of vitriol for state media. Shortly following the death of Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo last year, the Global Times called Liu and his supporters “losers” and dismissed their lives as a “waste.”
The People’s Daily message this week may be aimed for North Korea as much as it is for China, as Pyongyang prepares for what appears to be inevitable economic profit following dictator Kim Jong-un’s in-person meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. North Korean state media are more vitriolic and exaggerated than their Chinese counterpart, spending much of 2017 threatening a nuclear attack on the United States and sentencing Trump to death.

He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.

"East Coast developer Matt Rosendale is only looking out for himself and whatever out-of-state special interest group that is propping up his campaign with cash. We can't trust him to defend Montana." But before Trump arrived in Montana, Tester's campaign took out full-page ads in newspapers across the state, highlighting bills the senator sponsored that Trump has signed into law.
There are fewer than 450 North Atlantic right whales left in the world, and Canada is under international pressure to step up protection of the species, after 12 of the animals were killed last year in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence – many of them in collisions with ships and some after becoming tangled in fishing gear. Scientists believe climate change is causing the species to shift its feeding grounds into the Gulf, putting it on a collision course with the shipping and fishing industries. US lawmakers, meanwhile, say Canada isn’t doing enough to protect the whales and are threatening to block Canadian fishermen from selling lobster into the American market.

Despite decades of UN and government aid, 38% of the population lived in extreme poverty. Social workers proposed new a new approach. Puente al Desarrollo – A Bridge to Development – is human rights-based legislation that has seen government agencies and communities coming together to address social problems – and support people in meeting their aspirations. The new law applies a social work approach of responding to all the issues that contribute to poverty and strengthening community systems of self-care.

Pentagon Questioned Over Blackout On War Zone Troop Numbers

For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.
The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives. At first there was talk about a much bigger pot of money -- $100 million or more. When the bill was reintroduced this year, the amount was $20 million. By the end of the legislative session, it was down to $5 million.
VETERAN PROTESTING TREATMENT BY VA SETS HIMSELF ON FIRE NEAR GEORGIA STATE CAPITOL, POLICE SAY
"It looks like a veteran that was disgruntled with the VA did a personal protest in front of the Capitol which involved gasoline and some fireworks,” Commissioner Mark McDonough, of the Georgia Department of Public Safety, said. The commissioner added a Capitol trooper "actually put him out with his fire extinguisher." Watts had no current address. Veterans groups in recent years have demanded changes in the Veterans Affairs system as some veterans say they've waited months for appointments. President Trump last month signed legislation aimed at allowing veterans more freedom to see doctors outside the system in an attempt to reduce wait times and improve care.

If Seehofer does step down, it was not immediately clear what effect the move would have on a three-week impasse between Merkel and her Bavarian-only CSU partners, which has centered on his resolve to turn away some types of asylum-seekers at Germany's borders. Merkel has insisted on Europe-wide solutions to handling the waves of desperate foreigners trying to reach the continent and the standoff could spell the end of her fourth government. Merkel insisted earlier Sunday that a plan to regulate immigration European Union leaders approved Friday and agreements she hashed out with several key countries would accomplish what Seehofer seeks. "The sum total of everything we have agreed upon has the same effect" as what Seehofer has demanded, Merkel said in an interview with ZDF television. "That is my personal opinion.

The NHS will consume 66% of the Welsh budget by 2048 if demand increases in line with predicted demand, according to new research. Health economist Prof Ceri Phillips said spending on the NHS would need to rise by 4% a year. Currently £6bn out of a total Welsh budget of £14.5bn goes to the NHS. The Welsh Government said its Health and Social Care Plan aimed to reduce demand through more people managing their own health and well-being. BBC Wales Investigates had asked Prof Phillips, from Swansea University, to question existing projections for healthcare in Wales and then calculate how much extra spending would be needed to keep the NHS afloat.

Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups. According to the New York Times, the Supreme court’s decision will affect these left-wing groups and causes. “If the progressive movement is a navy, they’re trying to take out our aircraft carriers,” said Ben Wikler, of MoveOn.org, the Times reported. However, progressive groups are optimistic that the loss of union funds will be compensated for with grass-roots activism.

HR McMaster, National Security Adviser - 22 March 2018
A lieutenant general with the US Army, Mr McMaster served in Iraq and Afghanistan, where he worked on a government anti-corruption drive. He replaced Lt Gen Michael Flynn, who was fired after just three weeks and three days in the job after he misled Vice-President Pence about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. Time magazine named him as one of its 100 most influential people in the world in 2014, saying he "might be the 21st Century Army's pre-eminent warrior-thinker".
“We are not going to fight. We are always going to seek for there to be an agreement. … We are going to extend our frank hand to seek a relation of friendship, I repeat, of cooperation with the United States.”
Trump was equally tactful, telling reporters: “I think he’s going to try and help us with the border. “I think the relationship will be a very good one,” the US president said of the Mexican politician, whose swearing-in will be in December. “We talked about trade, we talked about Nafta, we talked about a separate deal, just Mexico and the United States.”
Such restraint contrasted with Trump’s call to López Obrador’s predecessor, weeks after his inauguration last year.

Meanwhile, other media personalities have faced kidnappings, arrests and physical abuse by mysterious hooded men who no journalist dare name - but every journalist in the country is convinced belong to the military intelligence agencies. But after maintaining months of silence as to what it has endured, or what exactly the military's complaints are, Dawn recently published a frank and stinging editorial. The editorial describes its important, factual reporting about the serious rift between civil and military authorities during the Nawaz Sharif government, which had infuriated the military, and Dawn's insistence on protecting the sources for its stories - a basic element of media ethics worldwide. The editorial states that "a campaign of disinformation, libel and slander, hate and virtual incitement to violence against Dawn and its staff has necessitated placing certain matters on record". It added that elements "within or sections of the state" are not upholding constitutional freedoms.
The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee is calling for 10 government officials who served at the State Department or White House during the Obama administration to testify in Congress about the Russia probe as he investigates possible government surveillance abuse during the 2016 election. In a Monday letter to a pair of congressional committees, Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., asked the Oversight and Judiciary Committees to take steps to interview former State Department officials Elizabeth Dibble, Jonathan Finer, Kathleen Kavalec, Lewis Lukens, Victoria Nuland, Thomas Williams and Jonathan Winer, as well as former Obama White House officials Jake Sullivan, Colin Kahl and Shailagh Murray. Dibble, the former deputy chief of mission at the U.S. embassy in London, a city where other figures in the Russia investigation were operating. Winer, a former Obama State Department official, has acknowledged he had regular contact with ex-British spy Christopher Steele, the author of the controversial anti-Trump dossier. Steele’s dossier was at the heart of the controversial memo released this year by Nunes alleging that the FBI sought a surveillance warrant for a Trump associate based in large part on that dossier, without fully revealing that the research had been funded by Democratic sources.

Police revoked Patriot Prayer's permit for the rally after the two groups began to clash. People were lighting firecrackers and smoke bombs in the crowd while police used flash bangs in an effort to disperse the clashing protesters.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.

Nebraska May Join Utah, Idaho in Putting Medicaid Expansion Before Voters

Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.

There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void. In New Jersey, this is compounded by the fact that the state is located between two big cities, New York and Philadelphia, that are in other states. The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.
President Trump had suggested lifting the prohibition, which environmentalists charge would raise levels of ground ozone during warmer months, during his campaign for the White House. Following the news of Mr. Pruitt’s resignation, Mr. Dinneen wrote that there was a “collective sigh of relief coming from the Midwest,” calling the 2019 ethanol quotas “the straw that broke the camel’s back.”
While it is too early to say how the handling of waivers or the treatment of E15 may change under new leadership, one indicator was small losses in affected refiners in early Friday trading and gains in most ethanol producers. CVR Refining, Andeavor and Delek U.S. Holdings , all of which benefited from waivers granted by the EPA, had rallied by 136%, 40% and 92% in the year ended Thursday, respectively. Ethanol companies Pacific Ethanol and Green Plains had fallen by 60% and 14%, respectively. Agricultural lobbyists often portray any easing of the rules as a sop to “big oil,” but that isn’t accurate.
The committee said on its website that it received the responses shortly before midnight on Friday; the deadline for the responses was the close of business Friday. It is Facebook’s second attempt at answering Congress’s queries. In June, Facebook delivered 450 pages of answers to two Senate committees, deflecting some questions about its influence and market power while offering some detail about the information it collects on users. Facebook has been under scrutiny since March when revelations surfaced that political analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, which aided President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, purchased data on 87 million users without their consent. In the ensuing hearings, lawmakers asked Mr. Zuckerberg whether Facebook was in violation of a settlement the company made in 2012 with the Federal Trade Commission, under which the company is required to give its users clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before sharing their information beyond their privacy settings.

Twenty-eight percent said they didn't know or had no opinion. But at the Barons game, conservative Republican voters in attendance spoke up about their disappointment.

LONDON — Over the past century American and British troops have fought side-by-side in two World Wars, Korea and the conflicts in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan. But some lawmakers and experts in the United Kingdom are warning that the British military could soon be seen as irrelevant by the United States unless it receives a colossal funding boost. "There is a concern that the U.K. is falling ever further behind and becoming even more useless from a U.S. point of view," said Andrew Dorman, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a think tank in London.
Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods.

In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop.

“It’s incredibly difficult to find housing in Seattle now,” said Nicole Keenan-Lai, executive director of Puget Sound Sage, a Seattle thinktank focused on low-income and minority communities. “Two years ago a study came out that said 35% of Seattle’s homeless population has some college or a college degree.”
John Burbank of the Economic Opportunity Institute said there is a a direct link between the surge in highly paid jobs and the numbers of people forced on to the street. “There’s an incredible correlation between the increase in homelessness and the increase in the number of people who have incomes in excess of $250,000,” he said. “That has grown by almost 50% between 2011 and 2017. The population of homeless kids in the Seattle public schools has grown from 1,300 kids to 4,200.”
Amazon has sought to improve its standing with financial support for organisations such as Mary’s Place to build a new shelter for 200 homeless women and families.
If you look at his high school yearbook, it said he wanted to be a lawyer. But I think he got involved with various movements, and that was more important to him at the time. And then he finally went back to school. GROSS: Was it hard for him to keep the lights on while he was in school? RILEY: I know that we were at various times on food stamps, and yeah.
As motorists pay more to fill their tanks this Independence Day -- with gas prices at a four-year high for the holiday -- safety advocates are urging caution during celebrations that turn deadly on U.S. roadways. The national average for a gallon of gas on Tuesday stood at $2.86, making it the costliest for an Independence Day holiday in four years, according to AAA. That said, the nearly 40 million motorists expected to travel this week will pay 11 cents less per gallon at the pump than they did this past Memorial Day holiday, the motorist club noted. "The national gas price average has held fairly steady for the past 10 days, suggesting that U.S. demand is keeping pace with supply and stabilizing summer gas prices," a spokesperson for the motorist group said in a statement. "However, elevated crude oil prices and other geopolitical concerns could tilt gas prices more expensive in the early fall despite an expected increase in global crude production from OPEC and its partners."
A look at recent developments in the South China Sea, where China is pitted against smaller neighbors in multiple disputes over islands, coral reefs and lagoons in waters crucial for global commerce and rich in fish and potential oil and gas reserves:

EDITOR'S NOTE: This is a weekly look at the latest developments in the South China Sea, the location of several territorial conflicts that have raised tensions in the region. ———
XI ASSERTS TERRITORIAL CLAIMS IN MEETING WITH US DEFENSE SECRETARY
Chinese President Xi Jinping strongly asserted China's determination to defend territory it claims, including in the South China Sea, in a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. While the tone of Mattis' visit to Beijing was largely upbeat, Xi made sure to reinforce his reputation as a fervent nationalist when it comes to issues of sovereignty. Though Xi gave no specifics in his statement, he was largely seen as indicating the South China Sea as well as self-governing Taiwan. China also claims territory held by India and uninhabited East China Sea islands controlled by Japan.
The proposal would:
Legalize the possession and sale of up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana for personal, recreational use for people over the age of 21. A person could keep up to 10 ounces of marijuana at home. Tax marijuana sales with a 10 percent excise tax at the retail level as well as the state's 6 percent sales tax. Split those revenues, with 35 percent going to K-12 education, 35 percent to roads, 15 percent to the communities that allow marijuana businesses in their communities and 15 percent to counties where marijuana business are located. Allow communities to decide whether they’ll allow marijuana businesses in their towns.
An interactive online HIV prevention program has reduced the sexually transmitted infection rates of gonorrhea and chlamydia by 40 percent among young gay and bisexual men, the first such approach to show an impact on sexual health, a new study found. The program, “Keep It Up!,” challenges traditional sexual education models and seeks to “keep up” HIV negative test results and educate racially and ethnically diverse at-risk gay and bisexual youth through soap operas, interactive games and real-world simulations. The program targets men 18 to 29 who have sex with men, a group that is disproportionately affected by HIV infections in the U.S. While this group represents only 2 percent of all young people, it accounts for 70 percent of HIV diagnoses according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Keep It Up!” is made up of different modules involving interactive games, exercises, a simulation at a bar and a soap opera.
The major U.S. stock indexes were mostly higher in early trading Friday following a solid jobs report, keeping the market on track for a weekly gain after two weeks of losses. The modest gains came despite an escalation in global trade tensions as the U.S. imposed tariffs on billions in Chinese goods and China responded in kind. Health care stocks posted the biggest gains, led by Biogen. The drugmaker's stock soared 18 percent to $353.28 on encouraging results from an Alzheimer's therapy. Industrials companies took some of the biggest losses.
Peach Wars: Southern States Spar Over Which Has The Most Juice
It's a juicy rivalry complete with peach emoji and a well-timed "bless your heart." The agriculture departments in Georgia and South Carolina sparred on Twitter this week over which of them really deserves the title of Peach State. It started with a tweet from South Carolina's Department of Agriculture — an account off to a feisty start since it was created in June. The department claimed that South Carolina harvests three times more peaches than Georgia does. We know Georgia gets all the credit but SC actually harvests three times more peaches than GA 🍑 pic.twitter.com/W8OXoj5Sh1 — South Carolina Department of Agriculture (@SCDAgriculture) July 3, 2018

On this much police and activist South Side priest Michael Pfleger can agree: Saturday morning’s anti-violence march on the Dan Ryan Expressway is all about danger. Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.
"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.
Leah Millis / Reuters Discussing school shootings, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told community leaders in his home state of Kentucky, “I don’t think at the federal level there’s much that we can do other than appropriate funds.”
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday he thinks the federal government can’t do much to help stop school shootings. “I don’t think at the federal level there’s much that we can do other than appropriate funds,” McConnell said while speaking to community leaders in Danville, Kentucky, the Lexington Herald-Leader reports. McConnell said he feels heightened security in schools may help prevent shootings but argued that’s not the responsibility of the U.S. Congress. “You would think, given how much it takes to get on an American plane or given how much it takes to get into courthouses, that this might be something that we could achieve, but I don’t think we could do that from Washington, I think it’s basically a local decision,” he said. “It’s a darn shame that’s where we are, but this epidemic is something that’s got all of our attention,” he added.
In their statement, Mr Netanyahu and Mr Morawiecki praised the Polish wartime government-in-exile, saying it tried to "raise awareness among Western allies of the systematic murder" of Polish Jews. They also said structures of the Polish underground state supervised by the Polish government-in-exile "created a mechanism of systematic help and support to Jewish people". However Yad Vashem said this contradicted decades of historical research and contained "grave errors and deceptions". It said much of the Polish resistance in its various movements "not only failed to help Jews, but was also not infrequently actively involved in persecuting them". Polish assistance to Jews during the Holocaust was "relatively rare", Yad Vashem said, and "attacks against and even the murder of Jews were widespread".
Abbott said on Tuesday night he never conceived of climate change as a moral challenge. “It was an issue, that’s all, and – at least on the actual changes we’ve so far seen – not a very significant one compared to man’s inhumanity to man; maintaining and improving living standards; and even to many other environmental issues such as degraded bush and waterways, particulate pollution, water quality in the third world, deforestation and urban overcrowding.”
He contended that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide from roughly 300 to 400 parts per million over the last century had not triggered “dramatic consequences”. Play Video 0:32 Andrew Probyn calls Tony Abbott 'destructive' in ABC report – video
“Storms are not more severe; droughts are not more prolonged; floods are not greater; and fires are not more intense than a century ago – despite hyperventilating reportage and over-the-top claims from Green politicians,” he said. “Sea levels have hardly risen and temperatures are still below those of the medieval warm period. Over time, temperature change seems to correlate rather more with sun spot activity than with carbon dioxide levels.
The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.
“I was defending myself,” Sumpter said during the hearing. Judge John Blawie told Sumpter that he believed his version of events, but had to follow the letter of the law. Under Connecticut law, assault victims cannot use deadly force if they are able to retreat from their attackers. By contrast, 27 states — most notably Florida — have passed so-called “stand-your-ground” laws, which entitle citizens to use force in self-defense if there is a reasonable belief of a threat. The Associated Press contributed to this report.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) spent a total of $4 billion on improper food stamp payments to those receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the USDA confirmed with Breitbart News on Friday. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service announced this week that improper payments made up 6.3 percent of SNAP money in the fiscal year (FY) 2017—the latest data available from the agency. Breitbart News analyzed the USDA’s data on food stamp spending and found that $4,007,026,532 of the $63,603,595,754 the agency spent on SNAP in FY 2017 went to improper payments. The USDA told Breitbart News that “it is important to note that improper payments include both overpayments and underpayments,” meaning that households on SNAP that received less than what they were supposed to receive for the month are also included in the percentage rate. Brandon Lipps, the Acting Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services at the agency, said that most improper payments are due to “human errors”—either because of state agencies miscalculating benefits or benefit recipients giving state agencies the wrong information.
CLACKAMAS, Ore. -- A black Oregon lawmaker says one of her constituents called police as she canvassed a Portland-area neighborhood that she represents. State Rep. Janelle Bynum, who is running for re-election this fall, said she was knocking on doors, talking to residents and taking notes on her cellphone in Clackamas on Tuesday when a Clackamas County sheriff's deputy showed up. Bynum said the deputy told her a woman called police because the lawmaker appeared to spend a long time at homes and appeared to be casing the neighborhood while on her phone, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. The deputy asked if she was selling something, and she introduced herself as a state legislator and told him she was canvassing, Bynum said. She said she only had campaign fliers, her cellphone and a pen on her.

The U.S. trade deficit dropped in May to the lowest level in 19 months as U.S. exports rose to a record level. But the trade gap between the United States and China increased sharply, underscoring the economic tensions between the world's two biggest economies. The Commerce Department says the May trade deficit — the difference between what America sells and what it buys in foreign markets — fell 6.6 percent to $43.1 billion. It was the smallest imbalance since October 2016. Exports climbed 1.9 percent to a record $215.3 billion.
You can’t push any group of people that hard, that fast and for that long and expect them to maintain their composure.”
Eric Young, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees’ Council of Prison Locals, now prays before he looks at his phone every morning, worried he’ll receive a message from BOP’s director notifying him of a staff death. Young estimates that around two-thirds of his union members were Trump supporters. That makes sense: It’s a law enforcement agency that leans white and male (72 percent male, 62 percent white), and many federal prisons are in rural parts of the country, which Trump dominated. But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau. BOP has long suffered the kind of problems you’d expect for a massive bureaucracy centered on caging tens of thousands of people.

Watts was transported to a nearby hospital, where 85 to 90 percent of his body was found to have been burned, Georgia State Patrol told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Authorities said Watts, upset with the federal agency designated to aid veterans, attached a homemade incendiary device and fireworks to his body before pouring liquid on himself. He then ignited the fluid. VETERAN PROTESTING TREATMENT BY VA SETS HIMSELF ON FIRE NEAR GEORGIA STATE CAPITOL, POLICE SAY

SAO PAULO (AP) — A Brazilian businessman who amassed and then lost a multi-billion-dollar fortune has been convicted of corruption and sentenced to 30 years in jail. Eike Batista was found guilty of paying around $16.5 million in bribes to the former governor of Rio de Janeiro to gain an advantage in government contracts. ———

It was described as a tense meeting, the BBC's Norman Smith said. Mrs May is trying to find an arrangement to unite her cabinet when ministers gather at her country retreat, Chequers, on Friday. The UK is leaving the EU in March 2019, but has yet to agree how it will trade with the remaining EU members - who are part of a single market and a customs union - in years to come. Some former Remain campaigners want the government to pursue close ties to the EU to avoid barriers to trade with Europe - but Eurosceptics say the UK needs freedom to set its own independent trade policy. After two alternative models for customs were criticised, Downing Street has come up with what it calls a "third way" solution to be presented on Friday, claiming it will offer "the best of both worlds" - frictionless trade with Europe and the freedom to strike international trade deals.
Nuclear wouldn't count toward the 50 percent mandate, and APS says its Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station is the largest electricity producer in the U.S.
Jeff Burke, APS director of resources planning, says customers would see 6 to 14 percent per year increases on their bills if the company is forced to ratchet up renewable use ahead of schedule. "We continue to add renewables to our system, but they have to make sense," Burke said. "It's not really about a target, it's about what makes sense for our customers' usage and what makes rates affordable and what keeps our system reliable." Thirty-two states with renewable standards didn't have, on average, a correlated rate increase, according to Wesley Hersche, an associate director of research with Arizona State University's Global Security Initiative. "These issues involve a complex interaction of factors, and we should be careful not to oversimplify things," Hersche wrote in April.

As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
The government will appoint a national LGBT health adviser and take measures to end so-called conversion therapy as part of a plan to deliver what Theresa May has promised will be “real and lasting change”. The proposals form part of an action plan published by the Equalities Office on Tuesday. It follows a UK-wide survey of LGBT people that had more than 108,000 responses, billed as the largest study of its kind. The 30-page plan contains a series of pledges, including to improve the police response to LGBT hate incidents, more support for LGBT students and teachers and improvements to gender identity services for transgender adults. The proposals, which will receive an initial £4.5m in funding, were welcomed by the campaign groups Stonewall and the LGBT Foundation.
In the four days since he was elected, he has repeatedly said he didn't want bodyguards and that "the people will protect me." He has also said the crowd of press also serves to protect him, but complained half-jokingly about the crush of journalists that accompany him everywhere — even interviewing him from motorcycles that shadow his car's every move. He said Thursday: "I would like a little, just a little bit, of privacy."
That may be less true in cases where U.S. companies engage in businesses with a ready substitute. Chinese leader Xi Jinping recently hinted that European and Asian conglomerates might soon find themselves benefiting as China punches back against the U.S.

In turn, that means American firms in China could soon find their new product models at the bottom of the regulatory pile for things like safety approvals, or their state-owned Chinese partners might shift resources toward European joint ventures instead. China has a history of this sort of bureaucratic malfeasance, with its consumers often helping out.

Breitbart News reported in April 2017 that the major Missouri institution would close a total of seven residential buildings. “Historically every year between now and August, various situations occur that result in position openings, e.g. normal attrition and voluntary staff choices, as well as unplanned academic or personal challenges,” the university said in a statement. “If necessary, we will offer alternative employment opportunities at comparable compensation to the remaining staff.”
Several years later, the university is still facing a crisis. According to new reports, the University of Missouri is currently facing a $49 million budget shortfall. Additionally, the university has laid off 30 employees and eliminated 155 vacant positions.
The number of predominantly Christian people killed in Nigeria by Muslim Fulani terrorists in the first six months of this year has dwarfed the fatalities carried out by the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL)-affiliated Boko Haram, a non-governmental organization (NGO) based in the African country revealed this week. In one weekend last month (June 23 and 24), the Fulani stormed nearly a dozen Christian-majority villages in Nigeria’s Plateau state, using machetes and firearms to massacre at least 200 people, including women and children. Referring to the Plateau incident in an article published by Nigeria’s Daily Post, the NGO, known as the International Society for Civil Liberties and the Rule of Law (Intersociety), noted Monday that the fatalities from the Fulani massacre could reach 300, making it one of the deadliest by any group in Nigeria. Intersociety explains:
The total death toll in Plateau State following the 23rd and 24th June 2018 coordinated attacks and killings in eleven villages may most likely have hit 300, from its present 250, out of which 218 bodies have been recovered and buried in mass graves. The activists on the ground said dozens of people are still missing after the head count was carried out.
"I think my own view is that China and the U.S. have this unavoidable mutuality where China only wins if the U.S. wins and the U.S. only wins if China wins and the world only wins if China and the U.S. win," Cook said in an early May conference call with investors to discuss the company's financial performance. "And so I think there's lots of things that bind the countries together and I'm actually very optimistic." Outside of Silicon Valley, several prominent Republicans have expressed concerns over the tariffs the administration is placing on Chinese goods. Former Massachusetts governor and presidential candidate Mitt Romney expressed hope that the tariffs can be quickly removed and a new trade agreement can be agreed upon by the world's two largest economies. "Trade wars are a tax on Americans," Romney wrote on Twitter.

Republicans are more likely to rate secure borders as a strong value; Democrats are more likely to rate welcoming immigrants and refugees as a strong value. In follow-up interviews, there was angst over the Trump administration policy, now modified, of separating children from their parents when they cross the border illegally. "There's always been immigrants; that's what this country is," says Kimberly Bainter, 29, of Norfolk, Virginia. The United States has become "less welcoming" than it used to be, says Harry Bridgen, 56, a band manager from Studio City, California, adding, "How scared and alone these children must feel." Hundreds of thousands rallied across the country Saturday to protest the immigration policy that resulted in more than 2,000 children separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border.

General Motors is one of the latest to weigh in on the threat of new tariffs targeting foreign autos and automotive parts, warning that GM could be forced to scale back production and cut U.S. jobs. GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra, who briefly served on President Donald Trump’s economic advisory council before it was disbanded last year, is the latest to come out against tariffs that could run as high as 25 percent. Harley-Davidson has already announced plans to move some production abroad, while BMW has said it would likely cut back operations at its Spartanburg, South Carolina plant that is currently the largest exporter of American-made automobiles.

On the whole, Jones, who served as a U.S. attorney in the state during Bill Clinton's second term, is getting generally good reviews at home. According to an April Morning Consult poll, 47 percent of state voters said they approved of the job he was doing, while 25 percent said they disapproved. Twenty-eight percent said they didn't know or had no opinion. But at the Barons game, conservative Republican voters in attendance spoke up about their disappointment.
Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.

For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.
Did he display these tendencies? He was a fairly good mayor. He used his term as mayor many times during the campaign [to show] how he was more pragmatic rather than authoritarian. And in that he is correct. He was also fairly popular as mayor and ended his term with a very respectable approval rating.
If that happens there would be plenty of credit to go around. Certainly President Moon would deserve great credit for his unprecedented initiative in engaging the North. Certainly Kim Jong Un would deserve great credit for seeing that he could achieve his country’s security without nuclear weapons. And certainly Trump would deserve great credit for seeing the possibility of a peaceful solution where many of his advisers saw military action as the only option. In the meantime, we have much hard work ahead.
At least 41 alleged injuries have been reported, but NHTSA has yet to publicly offer any answers. Now at the two-year anniversary of the investigation, safety advocates are expressing frustration over the limited information coming out of NHTSA, reports CBS News correspondent Kris Van Cleave. Following our reports and the decision by a number of police departments to start parking Explorers, Ford began offering a free repair if a customer asks for it. The automaker claims it "effectively resolves" the problem. NHTSA has received almost 200 complaints about the issue.

China's foreign ministry says retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods "took effect immediately" after Washington raised import duties on billions of dollars of Chinese goods. A foreign ministry spokesman, Hu Chunhua, on Friday gave no details of the increase. But Beijing previously issued a $34 billion list of American goods including soybeans and electric cars it said would be subject to 25 percent tariffs.
In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners. Alas, he is wasting his time trying to shift the views of the Democratic Party, which has become ever more left-wing, if not outright socialist. I think it is time for Mr. James to become a Republican. Guy Randolph

It’s shocking that Mr. James is surprised by the positive economic results of less regulation and lower taxes.
It would be wrong to say this incident proves that Australia is struggling with the #MeToo movement and what it might mean, although it is. Australia has a blokey culture, and there is considerable backlash to revelations of the ubiquity of sexual harassment, whether low level or more serious. It’s a “yes, but” response. Yes, but it’s not that bad. Yes, but women are taking it too far.
The Russell 2000 index picked up 5.33 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,660.42. Benchmark U.S. crude added 20 cents to $74.14 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 46 cents to $77.76 a barrel in London. Heating oil gained 1 cent to $2.16 a gallon. Wholesale gasoline added a penny to $2.12 a gallon.
Any amount of prescription opioid use was correlated with greater involvement. Among people with prescription opioid use disorder, nearly 20 percent had criminal justice involvement. For heroin users, it was 40 percent. "People who use opioids, including heroin, were up to 13 times more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system," says Winkelman. The study shows the complexity of the the opioid crisis, according to Josiah Rich, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Brown University, who wasn't involved in the research.
"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.
Amlo has said that a crackdown on corruption will mean that his administration will have more money at its disposal as it will stop millions of pesos being embezzled.
“They’ve twisted American values,” she said in a follow-up phone interview. “A lot of them are anti-God, anti-religion and anti-military.”
In the survey, most say they are proud to be Americans, although Republicans feel that way more strongly (90 percent) than Democrats (61 percent). There is no consensus when asked about the country’s current course, though: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. “Overwhelming majorities of those in both parties and independents agree that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.”” USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll

The Republican Party is rotting away. The problem is that GOP policies just aren’t popular. Most Americans unsurprisingly oppose climate denial, tax cuts for the wealthy, and putting children (including toddlers) in concentration camps, for example. The Republican Party has thus far managed to continue winning elections by creating “a coalition between racists and plutocrats,” as Paul Krugman put it. The party’s economic policies are aimed at benefitting wealthy individuals and corporations, but that’s a slim segment of the American electorate.

That's more than all but three Democratic senators (Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana), all of whom are from red states and facing re-election this fall. "I think he's terrific," Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., who also faces a tough re-election fight, said in an interview. "It's harder work when you're not interested in voting the party line. You've got to look at every issue from all sides." "I really have been pleasantly surprised how willing he is to tell Chuck Schumer to go fly a kite," she added, referring to the Senate minority leader.

Teddy Roosevelt hopped on whistle stop tour after whistle stop tour where he was able to drop into rural and suburban communities alike to deliver short, pre-packaged speeches that local papers would usually print verbatim. (He left them short on purpose for that very reason.) Franklin Roosevelt revolutionized and heightened the stature of the office with his fireside chats, that brought his message over the heads of the pesky press corps and directly into the living rooms of the American people. But, though it would have been seen as a scoop, even the reporters covering Lyndon B. Johnson had the good sense not to report on every turd he dropped in their presence. While the founders envisioned a government that moved slowly and methodically, today’s Wi-Fi-enabled political discourse is demanding the opposite.
"People who use opioids, including heroin, were up to 13 times more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system," says Winkelman. The study shows the complexity of the the opioid crisis, according to Josiah Rich, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Brown University, who wasn't involved in the research. It shows "the spectrum of the disease and its overlap with the criminal justice system, showing that the more you progress along that continuum, the more likely you are to get tangled up in the criminal justice system." The study also showed that most people with opioid use disorder had other mental illnesses and were also more likely to have certain chronic health conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The study authors argue for the need to engage and involve the criminal justice system in dealing with the opioid epidemic, including reducing overdose deaths.
"I told them how I was feeling, but they didn’t listen to me." There were no beds, so Rosa laid on the floor. She said she wondered whether she might die there on the cold, hard, floor of that Arizona detention center. "Thanks to God," she said, "I am better."
Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
According to a Russian state media report related by Turkey’s Hurriyet Daily News , the United States is planning to send next-generation B61 nuclear gravity bombs to NATO bases in several European countries, including Turkey. The bomb is said to be compatible with F-35 joint strike fighters, which Turkey is also due to receive amid some controversy. Hurriyet describes the B61 nuclear bomb and Russia’s sour reaction to the prospect of NATO bases receiving them:
The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) and the U.S. Air Force completed two non-nuclear system qualification flight tests of the B61-12 gravity bomb on June 9 at Tonopah Test Range in Nevada, according to a June 29 statement by DOE/NNSA. The test, which was reportedly the first of its kind, was aimed at extending the B61 bomb’s service life by adapting it to next generation aircraft, including B-2A Spirit Bomber. “The B61-12 LEP will consolidate and replace the existing B61 bomb variants in the [U.S.] nuclear stockpile.
Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left a demoralized agency where staff fear their ability to protect public health is diminished
Scott Pruitt is out but his impact on the environment will be felt for years
Scott Pruitt, who has finally stepped down as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency after a long-rumbling corruption scandal, rose to public prominence on the back of a series of increasingly outlandish ethical controversies. Scott Pruitt resigns: Trump's scandal-ridden EPA chief steps down Read more
From lobbying fast food company Chick-fil-A on behalf of his wife, to demanding his staff acquire a mattress from a Trump Hotel – not to mention the millions of taxpayer dollars spent on security, first-class travel and soundproof booths – Pruitt’s behavior clashed spectacularly with any pretense of Trump’s pledge to “drain the swamp” in Washington. But the lasting legacy of the former Oklahoma attorney general – who was picked by Trump after crusading against what he called the EPA’s “activist agenda” – is likely to be felt in the systematic weakening of environmental regulations. While not as eye-catching as, for example, his demand that his official vehicle use sirens so he could reach a French restaurant on time, Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left behind a demoralized agency where staff fret that their ability to protect public health has been diminished. A staunch ally of oil and gas companies, Pruitt stacked EPA advisory boards with industry representatives and sought to set aside whole troves of research that link pollution to various illnesses.
Many high-priced commercial parcels were under-assessed, pushing more of the tax burden onto smaller businesses and homeowners, the series concluded. Berrios’ office disputes that there are problems with commercial property assessments, the consultants haven’t been asked to work on the issue, and County Board President Toni Preckwinkle has said it would have to be addressed later. Kaegi, who is poised to take office in early December, said the issue “is something that we’re going to take a very close look at from the outset.” Tax hike coming? The assessor’s office conducts a major reassessment of all properties in the county over a three-year period, dividing up the geography by the north suburbs, south suburbs and the city. This year, the city is under review.

3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.
A "permanent" cease-fire the rivals agreed on last week was violated within hours on Saturday, with each side blaming the other. They have not yet agreed on any power-sharing deal. South Sudan's civil war has killed tens of thousands and created Africa's largest refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Millions are near famine and aid delivery is often blocked in one of the world's most dangerous countries for humanitarian workers.

When Shyaira Dineen was in first grade, a teacher of hers told her to mark her race as African-American on a standardized test. Dineen remembers that day clearly because she says it confused her. She has a black mother and a white father. "I didn't argue with her," says the 23-year-old, but she did think it was weird. "Why do I feel like I only have to choose one?
Cult activities escalated after the defeat of Aum members in the 1990 parliamentary election. During their bizarre election campaign, Asahara and his top disciples sang and danced to the guru's songs. In June 1994, the cult spread sarin gas in Matsumoto in central Japan, killing eight people and injuring more than 140 others, in an attack targeting residents who were protesting the cult's presence in their neighborhood and court officials handling their legal disputes. Nakagawa and key members produced sarin at a cult compound and sprayed it from a van, in what was later regarded as an experiment for the subsequent subway gassing. Under intensifying scrutiny from the government, the cult plotted the larger sarin attack on the subways in Tokyo on March 20, 1995.
"The possibility that these two investigations might be linked is clearly a line of inquiry for us," he said late Wednesday night. Initially, the investigation was led by local police, but Basu said counterterrorism detectives were taking charge after the substance was identified as Novichok. He said 100 officers had been assigned to the case. Police said officers were initially called Saturday morning about a collapsed woman, then were summoned back in the evening after a man fell ill at the same property. Police at first thought the two had taken a contaminated batch of heroin or crack.

Three of the teens were named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit. Howard told U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Dillon during a status conference Tuesday that all three original plaintiffs are no longer part of the case. But he said another teen "is anxious to participate in the case" and will be named as a new plaintiff. "We believe that his allegations with respect to his experience at the facility are sufficiently analogous ... to those of John Does Nos. 1, 2 and 3," Howard said.
Dec. 7, 2016: Trump announces that Pruitt will be his nominee for EPA administrator
The then-Attorney General of Oklahoma was touted by Trump as having "great qualifications and a good record." Part of that record was Pruitt touting himself as a "leading advocate against the EPA's activist agenda," and his history of challenging the EPA was well known. Feb. 17, 2017: Confirmed by the Senate
Pruitt's confirmation, which was approved with a vote of 52-46, came in the midst of a court order that required him to turn over thousands of communications with major coal, oil and gas companies from his time in office. Democratic senators expressed outrage that Republicans were going ahead as scheduled with the vote on Pruitt, despite the judge’s ruling in the order. March 23, 2017: Defends budget cuts to his agency
The budget plan put forward by the Trump administration proposed cuts 31 percent of the EPA’s funding, including significant reductions to research programs and enforcement of clean air and clean water programs, but that didn’t bother Pruitt.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
In his first loss — by a mere 0.56 percent to conservative Felipe Calderon in 2006 — his supporters held months-long protests in Mexico City and he referred to himself as "the legitimate president." His allies are warning even before Sunday's presidential vote that there better not be any funny business. "They shouldn't dare commit a fraud, because if they do they will meet the devil," said Yeidckol Polevnsky, president of Lopez Obrador's Morena party. "We will not accept it." Still, the voting Sunday was by and large peaceful, apart from the usual complaints about some volunteer-staffed polling places opening late.
There is reason to believe that might happen. The foundation, in conjunction with UIC, recently held its Chicago Community Conversation on the West Side. The event at UIC drew nearly 350 community activists, representing a broad range of interests, to exchange ideas about some of the city’s most pressing issues. Like most foundation forums, it was a spectacular event, drawing everyone from MacArthur Foundation “genius grant” winner Rami Nashashibi to philanthropic organizations to Tony- and Grammy-winning performer Daveed Diggs. Notably absent, though, was Obama.
Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.

* China is putting pressure on the European Union to issue a strong joint statement against President Donald Trump's trade policies at a summit later this month but is facing resistance, European officials said. * China's leaders are confident the country can cope with major and external risks, they said at a high-level internal financial meeting, amid financial turbulence at home and rising trade tensions with the United States. * China's central bank moved to calm jittery financial markets on Tuesday after the yuan dropped through the psychologically significant 6.7 to the dollar mark, hitting its lowest in almost a year as anxieties over U.S. trade frictions deepened. * U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will visit Mexico on July 13 to meet President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and discuss immigration, trade, security and development, the U.S. and Mexican governments said on Tuesday. * New orders for U.S.-made goods unexpectedly rose in May, pointing to a strengthening manufacturing sector, but business spending on equipment appeared to have slowed further in the second quarter.
There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void. In New Jersey, this is compounded by the fact that the state is located between two big cities, New York and Philadelphia, that are in other states. The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.

What has the government said? Mr Javid called on Russia to explain "exactly what has gone on", adding: "We will stand up to the actions that threaten our security." The home secretary said he was "comfortable" the "exact same nerve agent" had been used in both the Salisbury and Amesbury poisonings - but added it was not yet known if they were from the same batch. In response to Mr Javid's comments, Russia said the British government was subjecting them "to hell". Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova urged police not to be led by the "dirty political game" and said she was confident London would have to apologise to Russia.

Appointing Amul Thakar to the Supreme Court is an opportunity to make a bold outreach to the most prosperous of America’s immigrant communities and one that is increasingly important politically. The political benefits of naming Thapar are clear. Although Asian voters made up only 4 percent of the electorate in 2016, they are the fastest growing part of the electorate and a key factor in swing states such as Nevada (11 percent of the electorate) and Virginia (7 percent). Although they increasingly lean left, Republicans can get their votes. Nevada GOP Senator Dean Heller narrowly won re-election in 2012 by carrying 54 percent of the Asian vote.
The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. Teachers are also running a ballot measure campaign that would tax the highest income earners for an additional $690 million to spend on schools. “Regardless of political parties, we need people to make a decision about what’s happening in the classroom,” said Marisol Garcia, vice president of the Arizona Education Association. “To limit ourselves and to say ‘only these people are going to support us’ is just not true.”
Teachers can be at a disadvantage compared to wealthier candidates, who tend to have built-in networks of potential donors.

Began his career in environmental law at the EPA, as a special assistant in the agency's toxics office during President George H.W. Spent years playing various roles on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, which oversees the EPA, drafting regulations on chemical safety, air and water pollution and climate change — generally seeking to reduce government regulations on industries that generate greenhouse gases. Served as longtime aide to Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., whom you may recall from the 2015 floor speech in which he rebutted climate change science with a snowball. After leaving Congress, worked for years as a lobbyist for some of the largest coal, chemical and uranium companies in the U.S. — including the uranium mining firm that pushed for the reduction of Bears Ears National Monument, which is near one of its processing facilities.

When nothing else was working, civil disobedience is what eventually made authorities and the government listen.”
Law enforcement officials have asked Pfleger to reconsider, saying the protesters are putting their lives on the line by walking onto a busy expressway. In fact, Illinois State police troopers, who have jurisdiction over Chicago expressways, will try to stop protesters from getting on the Dan Ryan — and arrests will be made, if necessary.

If that happens there would be plenty of credit to go around. Certainly President Moon would deserve great credit for his unprecedented initiative in engaging the North. Certainly Kim Jong Un would deserve great credit for seeing that he could achieve his country’s security without nuclear weapons. And certainly Trump would deserve great credit for seeing the possibility of a peaceful solution where many of his advisers saw military action as the only option. In the meantime, we have much hard work ahead.
So it’s no exaggeration to say that critical legal rights and protections are truly hanging in the balance.”
‘A very, very modest preview’

“This was probably the best term that conservatives had in the supreme court maybe in my lifetime,” he said. The term might provide only “a very, very modest preview” of waves of conservative rulings to come, however, because a locked-down conservative majority would likely inspire rightwing activists to bring increasingly aggressive cases, said Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. “It’s not just that justice Kennedy’s successor is likely going to move the court to the right,” Vladeck said.
Referendum to remove ‘outdated’ clause encouraging mothers to choose domestic duties over paid employment to be held by November
Ireland to vote over constitution clause on women's role in the home
Ireland will hold a referendum to remove a clause in the constitution marking the importance of a woman’s “life within the home” and encouraging mothers to shun paid employment to fulfil domestic duties, the government has announced. The move unveiled on Thursday is the latest to update Ireland’s socially conservative 1937 constitution to reflect a more secular and socially liberal population. Ireland was long one of Europe’s most socially conservative countries, but opinions have changed rapidly in recent decades as the power of the Roman Catholic church has waned. A 2015 referendum introduced gay marriage into the constitution and a vote earlier this year allowed access to abortion. The constitution, which includes a number of references to the country’s traditional Christian ethos, currently contains a clause that “recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the state a support without which the common good cannot be achieved”.
Practice is only one of Deborah Glass’s 125 recommendations not accepted by Victorian government
Female prisoners in Victoria are still subject to “abusive” routine strip searches, a state government watchdog says. The Victorian ombudsman, Deborah Glass, said the government has failed to adopt a recommendation from her 2015 report into the prison system that called for an end to the searches. “Why has the government not accepted my recommendation to stop the abusive practice of routinely strip-searching women prisoners – in fact, the only recommendation out of 125 not accepted?” she asked on Wednesday. The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year.
"And for this reason the decision has been made to use the faster process of DNA verification to confirm that biological relationship."
Did he display these tendencies? He was a fairly good mayor. He used his term as mayor many times during the campaign [to show] how he was more pragmatic rather than authoritarian. And in that he is correct. He was also fairly popular as mayor and ended his term with a very respectable approval rating.
López Obrador, or Amlo as he is best known, romped to a historic landslide victory on Sunday night, capitalising on public frustration at soaring crime rates and corruption with a promise to drain Mexico’s very own swamp. Indeed, some see similarities between the two men. Like Trump, Amlo cast himself as a political outsider during his campaign, despite having been a professional politician for decades, although Amlo avoided much of the New York billionaire’s nastiness and nativism. Both men are considered inward-looking nationalists with López Obrador claiming “the best foreign policy is domestic policy” and preaching “mexicanismo”, a philosophy some have compared to Trump’s America First. But the US president was not an election issue in the recent Mexican campaign.
Those factories are the core of an American operation that employs about 136,000 people, but they're also dependent on components sourced overseas for reasons of cost or availability. About 70 percent of the parts in a U.S.-built Camry, the country's best-selling car, come from domestic suppliers. Toyota on June 27 said that Trump's threatened 25 percent tariff on automotive imports would add $1,800 to the price of each sedan. The carmaker's warning of the dangers of tit-for-tat tariffs was just one of many. German lighting manufacturer Osram Licht's shares plunged 22 percent Thursday after it announced a weaker outlook due to trade tensions.
There are fewer than 450 North Atlantic right whales left in the world, and Canada is under international pressure to step up protection of the species, after 12 of the animals were killed last year in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence – many of them in collisions with ships and some after becoming tangled in fishing gear. Scientists believe climate change is causing the species to shift its feeding grounds into the Gulf, putting it on a collision course with the shipping and fishing industries. US lawmakers, meanwhile, say Canada isn’t doing enough to protect the whales and are threatening to block Canadian fishermen from selling lobster into the American market.

“They’ve twisted American values,” she said in a follow-up phone interview. “A lot of them are anti-God, anti-religion and anti-military.”
In the survey, most say they are proud to be Americans, although Republicans feel that way more strongly (90 percent) than Democrats (61 percent). There is no consensus when asked about the country’s current course, though: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. “Overwhelming majorities of those in both parties and independents agree that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.”” USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll

What has the government said? Mr Javid called on Russia to explain "exactly what has gone on", adding: "We will stand up to the actions that threaten our security." The home secretary said he was "comfortable" the "exact same nerve agent" had been used in both the Salisbury and Amesbury poisonings - but added it was not yet known if they were from the same batch. In response to Mr Javid's comments, Russia said the British government was subjecting them "to hell". Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova urged police not to be led by the "dirty political game" and said she was confident London would have to apologise to Russia.

Key California lawmakers said Thursday they've reached an agreement on legislation to enshrine net neutrality provisions in state law after the Federal Communications Commission dumped rules requiring an equal playing field on the internet. California's bill is one of the nation's most aggressive efforts to continue net neutrality, and the deal comes after a bitter fight among Democrats over how far the state should go. Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener, who repudiated his own legislation when major pieces were removed two weeks ago, said those provisions have been restored under his agreement with Democratic Assemblyman Miguel Santiago. "We need to ensure the internet is an open field where everyone has access, the companies that are providing internet access are not picking winners and losers," Wiener told reporters at a Capitol news conference. Santiago came under fire from net neutrality advocates around the country when the Assembly committee he leads stripped key provisions from the legislation — a decision that drew rebukes from members of Congress, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.
But, though it would have been seen as a scoop, even the reporters covering Lyndon B. Johnson had the good sense not to report on every turd he dropped in their presence. While the founders envisioned a government that moved slowly and methodically, today’s Wi-Fi-enabled political discourse is demanding the opposite. Trump isn’t reinventing the wheel. If anything, he’s just spray painted an old, rusty wagon wheel with the glitzy gold that, over the decades, he’s made synonymous with his own family name. But this era of bright screens and on-demand delivery seems to be clouding our minds, as though we’ve purposefully trained ourselves to focus on the shiny spray painted object in front of us and not on the more important stories unfolding just off our phone screens.
A Florida man said Wednesday he felt “blessed” after someone turned in $1,300 he lost at a grocery store parking lot. Chris Woods, of Clearwater, had taken the money out from one bank account two weeks ago with the intention of putting it into another one, according to FOX13 Tampa Bay. He said he thinks he sandwiched the cash between two phones in his pocket and when he went to grab one of them in a Publix parking lot, the cash fell out. “We looked everywhere for it. I went everywhere and assumed it was gone,” Woods told the station.

But Matthew Buettgens, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a government and foundation supported policy research group says such budget discussion should take into account increased tax revenues and economic activity. "Of the states that have done detailed estimates of, 'What effect does Medicaid expansion have on the budget?' generally it's been found to be a net gain for the state," he says. Supporters say expansion could bring health insurance to around 90,000 low income Nebraskans – single people making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line, or $16,753 a year, or $34,638 for a four-person household. By law, the federal government would be required to pay 90 percent of the cost of that additional coverage.
In one case, Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion that illegal immigrants do not have the same bargaining rights as American citizens and legal workers. “… an illegal immigrant worker is not an ’employee’ under the NLRA for the simple reason that, ever since 1986, an illegal immigrant worker is not a lawful ’employee’ in the United States,” Kavanaugh wrote. In another case, Kavanaugh noted that American multi-national corporations do not have the right to import foreign workers. The Circuit judge explained, “Under the provision of the immigration laws at issue here, mere economic expediency does not authorize an employer to displace American workers for foreign workers.”
Prominent conservative Ann Coulter has also called for Trump to nominate Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, arguing that other judges such as Thomas Hardiman and Raymond Kethledge “are open borders zealots.”

The services sector, where most Americans are employed, has now expanded for 101 consecutive months, or more than eight years. The gain was better than many economists had been expecting and depicts an overall economy that appears to be regaining momentum after a slowdown in the winter.
He took a short position in shipping company Navigator Holdings worth between $100,001 and $250,000 on Oct. 31, five days after the New York Times contacted him about an article linking Navigator indirectly to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ross told CNBC earlier this week that he also shorted shares in Air Lease and Ocwen Financial. Ross, who plays a key role in increasingly high-stakes trade talks, says those sales were part of divestments made to work in government and he didn’t profit from those transactions. Democratic lawmakers are increasingly concerned, though. Last week, three members of Congress asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate whether Ross violated insider-trading laws.
Bishop John Bauerschmidt, who oversees the Middle Tennessee region of the church, stands firmly by his decision not to authorize their use, nor allow clergy within his diocese to officiate the religious ceremonies or permit the weddings on church property. In doing so, the bishop says he is being faithful to his job of guarding the discipline, faith and unity of the church.

"The teaching that Christian marriage is between a man and a woman is reasonable, traditional, and scriptural," Bauerschmidt said in an email. "There really is nothing remarkable about a Christian bishop who holds to this teaching." While Bishops can place limitations on the use of the marriage liturgies, they must refer couples to a willing diocese if they do not authorize them.
Even Pruitt’s own staff had begun to sour on him, with many worrying that their future career prospects would be damaged by their association with Pruitt’s tenure. Each scandal seemed more damning than the last. Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.

Breitbart News reported in April 2017 that the major Missouri institution would close a total of seven residential buildings. “Historically every year between now and August, various situations occur that result in position openings, e.g. normal attrition and voluntary staff choices, as well as unplanned academic or personal challenges,” the university said in a statement. “If necessary, we will offer alternative employment opportunities at comparable compensation to the remaining staff.”
Several years later, the university is still facing a crisis. According to new reports, the University of Missouri is currently facing a $49 million budget shortfall. Additionally, the university has laid off 30 employees and eliminated 155 vacant positions.
A helicopter trip to a hospital may not be the only shock a patient faces after a bad accident. The next one could hit when the bill arrives. Rides in so-called air ambulances can lead to bills of more than $20,000 depending on a person's coverage, and insurance experts say big invoices are becoming more common as costs rise and coverage shifts. Air ambulances transport around 400,000 people each year in the U.S., according to industry estimates. Most trips are from one hospital to another.
There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void. In New Jersey, this is compounded by the fact that the state is located between two big cities, New York and Philadelphia, that are in other states. The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.
(AFP) BEIRUT, Lebanon — At least eight battered rebel-held towns in southern Syria returned to regime control under Russian-brokered deals on Saturday as air strikes killed at least 15 civilians, a monitor said. Since June 19, backed by its ally Russia, the Damascus regime has carried out a deadly bombing campaign in southern Syria as it pushes to retake the strategic area bordering Jordan and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. As of Saturday, government forces controlled more than half of Daraa, up from just 30 percent at the start of the operation, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said. Eight towns in the province returned to regime control under Russia-brokered deals, the Observatory said. That came “after talks in each town between Russian generals as well as local notables and remaining rebels,” Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman said.

Some immigrant U.S. Army reservists and recruits who enlisted in the military with a promised path to citizenship are being abruptly discharged, the Associated Press has learned. The AP was unable to quantify how many men and women who enlisted through the special recruitment program have been booted from the Army, but immigration attorneys say they know of more than 40 who have been discharged or whose status has become questionable, jeopardizing their futures. "It was my dream to serve in the military," said reservist Lucas Calixto, a Brazilian immigrant who filed a lawsuit against the Army last week. "Since this country has been so good to me, I thought it was the least I could do to give back to my adopted country and serve in the United States military." Some of the service members say they were not told why they were being discharged.
Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
Under the laws, up to 40% of Supreme Court judges could be forced out. The first president of the court, Malgorzata Gersdorf, could be among those pushed out before her six-year term ends, by a rule that brings down the retirement age from 70 to 65, the EU warns. Why are the reforms so controversial? Poland insists its reforms, which have already come into effect, are aimed at updating an inefficient system and replacing judges who date back to a communist era that collapsed in 1989.

That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different. The interstate highways and the air travel revolution killed off most of the country’s long-distance passenger rail. The original Penn Station was razed in all its neoclassical glory, and its cramped replacement is a dingy national embarrassment. But 108 years later, the nation’s dense metropolitan areas still depend on railroads to bring millions of suburban commuters to their jobs; Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor line has become profitable and popular; and those twin Hudson tunnels and the swing-span Portal Bridge carry 450 New Jersey Transit and Amtrak trains every day.
America has a love-hate relationship with Walmart (WMT), sparking debates about whether the giant retailer helps or hurts the country's economy. It turns out that Walmart might be helping one segment that's overlooked in the debate: low-income families who struggle with food insecurity, according to new research from economists at Georgia State University, Nairobi's Columbia Global Centers and Samford University, and funded by the University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Some municipalities have sought to block or restrict Walmart from opening up within their borders, often on the grounds that a new Walmart could hurt local businesses. The researchers said they wanted to come at the question of Walmart's impact from another direction: "Are barriers to Walmart's entry at odds with the goal of eliminating hunger?"
As well as a new president, Mexican will be voting for 128 senators and 500 deputies in Congress as well as state and local officials. In all, 88 million people will be eligible to vote. Mexico is the second largest economy in Latin America and a major oil exporter. However, oil prices have dropped and the Mexican currency, the peso, has fallen sharply against the dollar. More than 40% of the population lives in poverty and high levels of corruption and violence have led some companies to pull out of the worst affected areas.
NANTERRE, France -- French investigators believe a team of four or five loyal accomplices carried out the brazen prison helicopter escape of one of France's most notorious criminals. The armed, masked men took a helicopter pilot hostage, forced him to land Sunday in Reau Prison's yard, used power tools to break through the prison yard's doors and hustled Redoine Faid to freedom. Inmates could be heard cheering on cell phone video taken inside the prison during the bust. Faid's brother, Brahim, was visiting him at the time of the escape. He was detained immediately afterward and freed late Monday.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.
“The water was coming out dark as coffee for hours,” McCathern remembered. The shock of it caught in his throat. “Something is wrong here.”
Something had been wrong for months. That spring, Flint, under direction from state officials, turned off the drinking water it had relied upon for nearly 50 years.

And then you have the old guard, like Pelosi and others at the top. And there is no overall messaging that is bringing that all together. That's why these arguments like abolish ICE start catching fire, because there's no other counter message out there from the Democrats--

As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) spent a total of $4 billion on improper food stamp payments to those receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the USDA confirmed with Breitbart News on Friday. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service announced this week that improper payments made up 6.3 percent of SNAP money in the fiscal year (FY) 2017—the latest data available from the agency. Breitbart News analyzed the USDA’s data on food stamp spending and found that $4,007,026,532 of the $63,603,595,754 the agency spent on SNAP in FY 2017 went to improper payments. The USDA told Breitbart News that “it is important to note that improper payments include both overpayments and underpayments,” meaning that households on SNAP that received less than what they were supposed to receive for the month are also included in the percentage rate. Brandon Lipps, the Acting Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services at the agency, said that most improper payments are due to “human errors”—either because of state agencies miscalculating benefits or benefit recipients giving state agencies the wrong information.
Practice is only one of Deborah Glass’s 125 recommendations not accepted by Victorian government
Female prisoners in Victoria are still subject to “abusive” routine strip searches, a state government watchdog says. The Victorian ombudsman, Deborah Glass, said the government has failed to adopt a recommendation from her 2015 report into the prison system that called for an end to the searches. “Why has the government not accepted my recommendation to stop the abusive practice of routinely strip-searching women prisoners – in fact, the only recommendation out of 125 not accepted?” she asked on Wednesday. The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year.
There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void. In New Jersey, this is compounded by the fact that the state is located between two big cities, New York and Philadelphia, that are in other states. The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.
The problem is so pervasive that a lawmaker recently asked El Salvador's Legislative Assembly for national identity cards to be issued without addresses "to save lives." Fifteen years ago, the Salvadoran government began a crackdown on gangs, resulting in thousands of members being imprisoned. Yet they continued to proliferate, even running operations with cell phones from behind bars. El Salvador's defense minister said in 2015 there were 60,000 gang members in the country, compared to a combined police and army strength of 50,000. Members of those security forces contribute to the violence that is causing the northward migration.
Jordan, who has served in the House since 2007, repeatedly has said he only learned about the alleged abuse this spring, when former students began speaking out. On Tuesday there were conflicting claims Jordan that had been contacted by the university's law firm regarding the investigation. But Jordan's office maintains it has no records of any efforts to contact the congressman: "Despite claims to the contrary, Congressman Jordan's office has not received a request for interview from the investigative team. We have demanded that they send us the supposed communication and remain willing to assist in any way that we can." Former Ohio State wrestler Mike DiSabato, whose allegations against Strauss prompted the investigation, told NBC that Jordan was lying.
Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. Federal prosecutors on Tuesday publicly debunked conspiracy theories pushed by President Donald Trump and right-wing media that a former Democratic aide charged with bank fraud was actually a foreign spy trying to steal government secrets. In a plea deal with Imran Awan, who worked as an information technology aide for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., and other Democratic lawmakers, prosecutors said they had conducted "a thorough investigation" into claims that Awan stole information from government servers on behalf of another country while working for House Democrats, but reported that they found no evidence to support the conspiracy theories. "The Government agrees that the public allegations that (Awan) stole U.S. House of Representatives equipment and engaged in unauthorized or illegal conduct involving House computer systems do not form the basis of any conduct relevant to the determination of the sentence in this case," prosecutors said.
Last week, the new Italian government – a coalition of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the far-right Lega – was so frustrated by the failure to make progress on migration that it refused to sign the conclusions of the European council. “Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,” an Italian official said. Italy – which is now at the centre of both the euro and refugee crises as much as Greece once was – could be the key swing state in the three-way clash of visions. There are sections of Italian society that support each. Much of the Italian centre-right – which always supported European integration and in particular the euro as a way to impose external discipline on the country – supports Merkel’s vision of a competitive Europe.
If anything, he’s just spray painted an old, rusty wagon wheel with the glitzy gold that, over the decades, he’s made synonymous with his own family name. But this era of bright screens and on-demand delivery seems to be clouding our minds, as though we’ve purposefully trained ourselves to focus on the shiny spray painted object in front of us and not on the more important stories unfolding just off our phone screens. While the founders envisioned a government that moved slowly and methodically, today’s Wi-Fi-enabled political discourse is demanding the opposite, and the allure of being one day’s internet sensation has drawn most all of us in like moths to a flame named Trump — the one steady, bright light that we all shamelessly, even helplessly, flitter towards even as we should know the momentary warmth is hiding the heat that will eventually be our own doom. Trump’s chaos theory of running companies is now on full display in the West Wing, but it’s also on display in the rest of us. He’s the made himself the center of our universe, and most of us are now unwittingly circling his orbit.
Algeria Strands Thousands Of Migrants In The Sahara
Algeria has abandoned more than 13,000 migrants in the Niger desert in the past 14 months, according to new reports. NPR's Michel Martin talks with AP reporter Lori Hinnant about their plight. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
The EU has been putting pressure on countries to stop migrants from entering Europe through North Africa, but that's precipitating another humanitarian crisis. The Associated Press is reporting that Algeria has abandoned more than 13,000 migrants and refugees in the Sahara Desert over the last 14 months. The migrants are mostly people who are crossing Algeria trying to get to Europe.
Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.
The vast majority of swing voters across the United States oppose the Democrats’ latest plan to abolish all immigration enforcement by ending the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. In recent weeks, Democrats in the House and Senate, along with progressive liberals like Cynthia Nixon in New York and most recently insurgent Democrat candidate for Congress, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have been demanding ICE be abolished and all immigration enforcement be ended. House Democrats are now crafting legislation that would officially abolish ICE. The latest Harvard/Harris Poll, though, reveals that swing voters are overwhelmingly opposed to the Democrats’ plan to end all immigration enforcement across the U.S.
Nearly 3-in-4 swing voters, about 73 percent, of swing voters said they do not want ICE to be disbanded. Less than 30 percent of swing voters said they support the abolishment of ICE.
President Trump has just said in the past week he's going to raise things like Syria, like Ukraine, like the election meddling issue, really the whole range of issues between us. And I think that, in the president's mind, this is very important, because it gives him an opportunity to size up Vladimir Putin, to see where there are areas where we might make progress together and where there are areas where we may not. BRENNAN: Well, right now, Russia is blanket-bombing Southern Syria. That violates the last agreement Vladimir Putin made with President Trump. Why would he believe that he's in any way trustworthy?

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen.

Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt’s resignation was “long overdue,” some lawmakers said as President Trump announced the Cabinet change on Thursday. Pruitt, 50, and his office, which he led since 2017, had come under fire for extravagant spending habits, including on first-class travel, pay raises to top aides and a $43,000 soundproof booth. In announcing his resignation on July 5, Trump said Pruitt had “done an outstanding job” leading the EPA and “will always be thankful to him for this.”
The resignation sparked a variety of responses from lawmakers. “Scott Pruitt was the worst EPA administrator in the history of the agency. Not only has he acted, time and time again, in an unethical manner, but he has led the agency in exactly the wrong direction,” Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said in a statement.

In their statement, Mr Netanyahu and Mr Morawiecki praised the Polish wartime government-in-exile, saying it tried to "raise awareness among Western allies of the systematic murder" of Polish Jews. They also said structures of the Polish underground state supervised by the Polish government-in-exile "created a mechanism of systematic help and support to Jewish people". However Yad Vashem said this contradicted decades of historical research and contained "grave errors and deceptions". It said much of the Polish resistance in its various movements "not only failed to help Jews, but was also not infrequently actively involved in persecuting them". Polish assistance to Jews during the Holocaust was "relatively rare", Yad Vashem said, and "attacks against and even the murder of Jews were widespread".

Trump’s campaign to limit legal and illegal immigration is driving up wages and salaries for Americans in various locations and careers around the country. The beneficiaries include new employees, African-American bakers in Chicago, Latino restaurant workers in Monterey, Calif., disabled people nationwide, high schoolers, resort workers in Hilton Head, construction workers, Superbowl workers, the garment industry, and workers at small businesses, and even Warren Buffett’s railroad workers. Amnesty advocates rely on business-funded “Nation of Immigrants” push-polls to show apparent voter support for immigration and immigrants. But “choice” polls reveal most voters’ often-ignored preference that CEOs should hire Americans at decent wages before hiring migrants.
The proposal would:
Legalize the possession and sale of up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana for personal, recreational use for people over the age of 21. A person could keep up to 10 ounces of marijuana at home. Tax marijuana sales with a 10 percent excise tax at the retail level as well as the state's 6 percent sales tax. Split those revenues, with 35 percent going to K-12 education, 35 percent to roads, 15 percent to the communities that allow marijuana businesses in their communities and 15 percent to counties where marijuana business are located. Allow communities to decide whether they’ll allow marijuana businesses in their towns.
Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) trashed the June jobs report — even though it showed rapid job growth, rising wages, and low unemployment. The report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that employers created 213,000 new jobs in June — 22,000 more than economists had expected. Manufacturing jobs in particular rose by 36,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.
"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.
The services sector, where most Americans are employed, has now expanded for 101 consecutive months, or more than eight years. The gain was better than many economists had been expecting and depicts an overall economy that appears to be regaining momentum after a slowdown in the winter.
"The president of the republic and his government will be absolutely respectful and support the authorities that are elected," Pena Nieto told reporters. Hovering over the election is the specter of vote fraud, though electoral officials deny it is a possibility with the modern balloting technology and institutions now in place. In both of Lopez Obrador's previous two presidential losses he alleged fraud. In his first loss — by a mere 0.56 percent to conservative Felipe Calderon in 2006 — his supporters held months-long protests in Mexico City and he referred to himself as "the legitimate president." His allies are warning even before Sunday's presidential vote that there better not be any funny business.

In the lead-up to the upcoming NATO summit in Brussels, President Donald Trump has reportedly sent “sharply worded letters” to the leaders of several NATO allies, escalating his long-simmering feud with the military alliance. The New York Times reported Monday that the letters, sent last month to leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Prime Minister Charles Michel of Belgium, rebuked NATO allies for not spending enough on their own defense ― a criticism that Trump has repeatedly leveled against other alliance members. The president also suggested in the letters that the U.S. would consider reducing its military commitment globally if its allies don’t ramp up spending, reported the Times. In his letter to Merkel, Trump reportedly wrote: “There is growing frustration in the United States that some allies have not stepped up as promised. The United States continues to devote more resources to the defense of Europe when the Continent’s economy, including Germany’s, are doing well and security challenges abound.
President Donald Trump appeared to rely on a dubious Fox News report Tuesday morning to unleash an attack on his predecessor, accusing President Barack Obama, without any real evidence, of granting citizenship to 2,500 Iranians as part of nuclear deal negotiations. "Just out that Obama Administration granted citizenship, during the terrible Iran Deal negotiation, to 2,500 Iranians - including to government officials," Trump tweeted. "How big (and bad) is that?" Jeff Prescott, the former senior director on Obama's National Security Council, called Trump's allegation "absurd and entirely false." Prescott shared with CNN immigration data from the Department of Homeland Security which showed that the number of Iranians naturalized in the United States over the course of the Obama and Bush administrations was relatively consistent.
Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left a demoralized agency where staff fear their ability to protect public health is diminished
Scott Pruitt is out but his impact on the environment will be felt for years
Scott Pruitt, who has finally stepped down as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency after a long-rumbling corruption scandal, rose to public prominence on the back of a series of increasingly outlandish ethical controversies. Scott Pruitt resigns: Trump's scandal-ridden EPA chief steps down Read more
From lobbying fast food company Chick-fil-A on behalf of his wife, to demanding his staff acquire a mattress from a Trump Hotel – not to mention the millions of taxpayer dollars spent on security, first-class travel and soundproof booths – Pruitt’s behavior clashed spectacularly with any pretense of Trump’s pledge to “drain the swamp” in Washington. But the lasting legacy of the former Oklahoma attorney general – who was picked by Trump after crusading against what he called the EPA’s “activist agenda” – is likely to be felt in the systematic weakening of environmental regulations. While not as eye-catching as, for example, his demand that his official vehicle use sirens so he could reach a French restaurant on time, Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left behind a demoralized agency where staff fret that their ability to protect public health has been diminished. A staunch ally of oil and gas companies, Pruitt stacked EPA advisory boards with industry representatives and sought to set aside whole troves of research that link pollution to various illnesses.
"Please join me in praying for the injured and their families. We must come together to condemn this vile act." Megan Schwab, who works with the International Rescue Committee in Boise, said the organization was working to provide temporary housing, counseling and other support to those affected by the attack. For some of the refugees living at the complex, the attack revived traumatic memories of the war and violence they had fled. The blood from the stabbings reminded residents Ibod Hasn and Thado Aip of the terror they left in Somalia, they said on Sunday.

Multiple proposed travel bans were stayed by federal courts. Congress has passed various immigration laws; some have been interpreted to allow the executive to restrict immigration the way Trump has, while other interpretations suggest that he cannot. The courts will rule on the question, and the Trump administration will almost certainly honor that ruling, as it has every other court ruling. That does not mean Trump will be nice about it; it does not mean the absence of absurd, scurrilous and misleading tweets. It simply means that the legal process will be obeyed.
Maryanne Trump Barry, the president's sister, served with him until her retirement. He drove a taxi to get through law school, and his degrees from Notre Dame and Georgetown give him a non-Ivy League appeal. Minuses: His star appears to be fading. A limited paper trail on the appeals court worries some conservatives. He is not known as a great legal theorist like Kavanaugh, nor is he a "feeder judge" whose law clerks are snapped up by Supreme Court justices.
Even Pruitt’s own staff had begun to sour on him, with many worrying that their future career prospects would be damaged by their association with Pruitt’s tenure. Each scandal seemed more damning than the last. Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.
Focusing much-needed attention on the South Side does not give the city a license to ignore other struggling neighborhoods. Three years ago, when UIC and the University of Chicago were both engaged in aggressive campaigns to woo the presidential center to their neighborhoods, things got a little testy. People forgot that although there were two separate bids from Chicago, the South Side and the West Side were playing for the same team. Everyone took a deep breath and thought about the alternative — losing the center to either New York or Hawaii. So in a striking show of unity, the two universities came together for a community breakfast designed to send a message to Obama.

Began his career in environmental law at the EPA, as a special assistant in the agency's toxics office during President George H.W. Spent years playing various roles on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, which oversees the EPA, drafting regulations on chemical safety, air and water pollution and climate change — generally seeking to reduce government regulations on industries that generate greenhouse gases. Served as longtime aide to Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., whom you may recall from the 2015 floor speech in which he rebutted climate change science with a snowball. After leaving Congress, worked for years as a lobbyist for some of the largest coal, chemical and uranium companies in the U.S. — including the uranium mining firm that pushed for the reduction of Bears Ears National Monument, which is near one of its processing facilities.
Trump has since signed an executive order to block the separation of undocumented families attempting to enter the country, but Birdwell believes that’s not enough to undo damage the policy has caused. “There’s no guarantee that they'll go back with their parents again, and beside all the torture they've gone though, they are going to need a lot of help and support and psychological help and emotional help through all this,” Birdwell said. Those who attended the Round Lake Beach rally were encouraged to bring 24-inch-by-24-inch piece of fabric to share their message of outrage and to start a quilt that Birdwell intends to send to elected officials in Washington, D.C.
Birdwell also arranged for a station where those in attendance could register to vote. Lindsey Salvatelli/Lake County News-Sun Community members hold up signs at Sunday's Families Belong Together rally at Round Lake Beach. Nearly 100 people showed up with signs and support for families that were separated under a controversial immigration policy issued by the Trump administration.
Last month, both houses of the New Jersey legislature passed the "Civic Info Bill." The bill sets up a nonprofit group that will be supported by five of the state's universities.

New Jersey governor Phil Murphy signed a state budget on Sunday night that allocates $5 million for the Civic Information Consortium. But Murphy hasn't signed the bill yet.

However, oil prices have dropped and the Mexican currency, the peso, has fallen sharply against the dollar. More than 40% of the population lives in poverty and high levels of corruption and violence have led some companies to pull out of the worst affected areas. The run-up to Sunday's elections has seen some of the worst violence in living memory, our correspondent says, as criminal groups attempt to control local politics. More than 130 candidates and political workers have been killed across the country since campaigning began in September. On Saturday, a journalist was shot dead in a bar in the village of Saban in the southern state of Quintana Roo, officials said.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
It was described as a tense meeting, the BBC's Norman Smith said. Mrs May is trying to find an arrangement to unite her cabinet when ministers gather at her country retreat, Chequers, on Friday. The UK is leaving the EU in March 2019, but has yet to agree how it will trade with the remaining EU members - who are part of a single market and a customs union - in years to come. Some former Remain campaigners want the government to pursue close ties to the EU to avoid barriers to trade with Europe - but Eurosceptics say the UK needs freedom to set its own independent trade policy. After two alternative models for customs were criticised, Downing Street has come up with what it calls a "third way" solution to be presented on Friday, claiming it will offer "the best of both worlds" - frictionless trade with Europe and the freedom to strike international trade deals.

If the unthinkable were to happen and Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., were injured in any way by an assailant, the situation must be squarely laid at the feet of the president of the United States. There isn’t much ambiguity about this, anyone can connect the dots. More: Democrats took the bait from Donald Trump, it's not a winning strategy at the polls
President Donald Trump is playing with fire by calling Waters “crazy” and accusing her of corruption. The potential awful effects, which he can neither foresee nor control, are dangerous. Trump is playing with people’s lives.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) spent a total of $4 billion on improper food stamp payments to those receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the USDA confirmed with Breitbart News on Friday. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service announced this week that improper payments made up 6.3 percent of SNAP money in the fiscal year (FY) 2017—the latest data available from the agency. Breitbart News analyzed the USDA’s data on food stamp spending and found that $4,007,026,532 of the $63,603,595,754 the agency spent on SNAP in FY 2017 went to improper payments. The USDA told Breitbart News that “it is important to note that improper payments include both overpayments and underpayments,” meaning that households on SNAP that received less than what they were supposed to receive for the month are also included in the percentage rate. Brandon Lipps, the Acting Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services at the agency, said that most improper payments are due to “human errors”—either because of state agencies miscalculating benefits or benefit recipients giving state agencies the wrong information.
Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) trashed the June jobs report — even though it showed rapid job growth, rising wages, and low unemployment. The report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that employers created 213,000 new jobs in June — 22,000 more than economists had expected. Manufacturing jobs in particular rose by 36,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.
ZTE is far from alone. China assembles some 90 percent of the world's smartphones, computers and other electronics. But most of the revenue flows to American companies that supply computer chips and other technology. In the broader economy, Chinese banks, airlines, farms and other industries need U.S. technology from jetliners to drugs to software. What Washington welcomes as a source of well-paid jobs, Chinese leaders consider a dangerous dependence.
You've had Senators Joe Donnelly, Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp, who are the three red state Democrats who voted in favor of Neil Gorsuch, get their only personal meeting with President Trump and who say they are very open to confirming President Trump nominee who -- if the nominee is the right person. So those are the five senators who our attention is going to be really on for the next two months. BRENNAN: And what about immigration, Jan? Do you think this could actually come before the Supreme Court (INAUDIBLE)?
“They’ve twisted American values,” she said in a follow-up phone interview. “A lot of them are anti-God, anti-religion and anti-military.”
In the survey, most say they are proud to be Americans, although Republicans feel that way more strongly (90 percent) than Democrats (61 percent). There is no consensus when asked about the country’s current course, though: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. “Overwhelming majorities of those in both parties and independents agree that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.”” USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll

"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.
Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
“We’ve looked into our options – there really are none. The irony is not lost on me. Here we are being sued for having a welcoming city ordinance and people are being deported out of the airport.”
ICE began using the airport for detainee removal flights in June 2013. The immigrant detainees are bused into Gary from a detention center about 40 miles away in Broadview, Ill. They are then flown to Brownsville, Texas, near the Mexican border, for deportation.
In a speech to the huge crowd in the Zocalo, he struck a moderate tone, stressing a need to act respectfully, to maintain economic and financial stability. He also pledged to increase support payments for the elderly and to give scholarships or paid apprenticeships to young people. "Now that he has won, he cannot fail this new generation that believes in him," said Mariano Bartolini, a 29-year-old lawyer who voted for Lopez Obrador in the northwestern city of Rosarito, near Tijuana. "It is thanks to us young people who are supporting him that he was able to get more votes than he did in past elections." ———

So let’s be clear - you have no shared plans,no tourist business consultation and no agreement with the Scottish Gov. — Fiona Hyslop (@FionaHyslop) July 4, 2018 Report
On Wednesday, Mr McVey said the council had "engaged pretty consistently" with the government, adding: "Fiona Hyslop said any scheme would require engagement with the industry and that's exactly what we're doing. "We have taken a far more robust and professional approach and I've noticed a huge amount of openness to the idea in some quarters that were fairly dismissive of our previous attempts as a local authority." The Scottish Conservatives - who oppose having a tourist tax scheme - said the exchange was "an embarrassing split right at the top of the SNP", with Ms Hyslop "slapping down" Mr McVey "in full public view".
They are to consult on detailed plans to restrict the promotion and marketing of foods high in salt, sugar and fat. This would target confectionary, biscuits, crisps, cakes, pastries, sugary soft drinks and potentially ice creams, and include restrictions on multi-buy offers, meal deals, unlimited refill deals and where products can be displayed in shops. Newly appointed public health minister Joe Fitzpatrick said "far too many people" were facing "serious risks to their health" which were "largely avoidable". 'Profound impact'
The new government report states that "the Scottish diet remains stubbornly unhealthy", with the country "far from meeting our dietary goals" - something which has a "profound" impact on health and lifestyle. Problems start early, with the report setting out "alarming" findings on the number of children consuming food and drinks high in fat or sugar - studies suggest 29% of children are at risk of being overweight, half of whom are at risk of obesity.
In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners. Alas, he is wasting his time trying to shift the views of the Democratic Party, which has become ever more left-wing, if not outright socialist. I think it is time for Mr. James to become a Republican. Guy Randolph

It’s shocking that Mr. James is surprised by the positive economic results of less regulation and lower taxes.
The president told Fox News that he believes his nominee will get some support from Democrats. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, an abortion rights supporter, is considered one of the key votes on a nominee. She said she wouldn't vote for someone who would overturn Roe v. Wade. "A candidate who would overturn Roe would not be acceptable," she said Sunday on ABC's This Week. Collins, who has previously bucked party lines on other key issues such as health care, said she plans to have an in-depth conversation with the nominee.
“There is nothing in their background to suggest that at all.”

Police have cordoned off at least five areas, including a park, a church and a pharmacy, where the couple had been before they became sick. Officials said people who had been in the areas around where the pair had been before collapsing should wash their clothes, although they insisted risk of contamination was minimal. The pair is now being treated in the same hospital where Skripal and his daughter spent weeks in critical condition following the attack, which London blamed on Moscow.
"The president of the republic and his government will be absolutely respectful and support the authorities that are elected," Pena Nieto told reporters. Hovering over the election is the specter of vote fraud, though electoral officials deny it is a possibility with the modern balloting technology and institutions now in place. In both of Lopez Obrador's previous two presidential losses he alleged fraud. In his first loss — by a mere 0.56 percent to conservative Felipe Calderon in 2006 — his supporters held months-long protests in Mexico City and he referred to himself as "the legitimate president." His allies are warning even before Sunday's presidential vote that there better not be any funny business.

In what ways should these concerns shape congressional expectations about transparency of the nominee vetting process and the standards for recusal in cases involving President Trump’s legal affairs? Consider first the not-unlikely prospect of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who has developed a robust view of presidential immunity from legal process fully consistent with some of the more aggressive positions of the president and his legal team. Kavanaugh has written that:
Congress might consider a law exempting a President—while in office—from criminal prosecution and investigation, including from questioning by criminal prosecutors or defense counsel. Criminal investigations targeted at or revolving around a President are inevitably politicized by both their supporters and critics. As I have written before, “no Attorney General or special counsel will have the necessary credibility to avoid the inevitable charges that he is politically motivated—whether in favor of the President or against him, depending on the individual leading the investigation and its results.” The indictment and trial of a sitting President, moreover, would cripple the federal government, rendering it unable to function with credibility in either the international or domestic arenas.
Teddy Roosevelt hopped on whistle stop tour after whistle stop tour where he was able to drop into rural and suburban communities alike to deliver short, pre-packaged speeches that local papers would usually print verbatim. (He left them short on purpose for that very reason.) Franklin Roosevelt revolutionized and heightened the stature of the office with his fireside chats, that brought his message over the heads of the pesky press corps and directly into the living rooms of the American people. But, though it would have been seen as a scoop, even the reporters covering Lyndon B. Johnson had the good sense not to report on every turd he dropped in their presence. While the founders envisioned a government that moved slowly and methodically, today’s Wi-Fi-enabled political discourse is demanding the opposite.
As well as a new president, Mexican will be voting for 128 senators and 500 deputies in Congress as well as state and local officials. In all, 88 million people will be eligible to vote. Mexico is the second largest economy in Latin America and a major oil exporter. However, oil prices have dropped and the Mexican currency, the peso, has fallen sharply against the dollar. More than 40% of the population lives in poverty and high levels of corruption and violence have led some companies to pull out of the worst affected areas.
Any amount of prescription opioid use was correlated with greater involvement. Among people with prescription opioid use disorder, nearly 20 percent had criminal justice involvement. For heroin users, it was 40 percent. "People who use opioids, including heroin, were up to 13 times more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system," says Winkelman. The study shows the complexity of the the opioid crisis, according to Josiah Rich, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Brown University, who wasn't involved in the research.
It was no surprise to read that the very first lesson you suggest could be learned from overseas (Five things the NHS could do to improve service, 3 July) is the establishment of integrated health and social care, as has happened in New Zealand. The achievements of the Attlee government are at the heart of my socialist beliefs but the compromises which led then to the split between free NHS care and means-tested social care remain the achilles heel as the NHS celebrates 70 years. It is utterly ludicrous to have separate systems which imply distinct and neat boundaries between health and care, with rather a lot of people making a good living arguing on which side of the fence some poor demented soul belongs. Disputes around the funding of continuing care have become a major industry. The recent NHS funding announcement, making no reference whatsoever to social care, evidenced the fact that the government still hasn’t the least idea of how the two are umbilically linked.
This was particularly an issue for Pruitt’s former executive scheduler Sydney Hupp, who often had to shell out for Pruitt’s trips. Hupp was also asked by Pruitt to speak with staff at one of Trump’s hotels, believing he could get a deal on a second-hand mattress they were selling. Pruitt remained miserly even when he was abusing his position to get a good deal. He fell behind on the rental payments on the condo he was getting on the cheap and eventually had to be evicted and the locks were changed.
'We’re going to run different'
His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.
Pentagon Questioned Over Blackout On War Zone Troop Numbers
Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images
For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.
He spent more than six months waiting for a final decision on his status from the Home Office.

“I don’t want to remember,” he said. “It pains me a lot. We worked nonstop, all the time, no sleep, picking stones out of the conveyor belts of fish.
But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau. BOP has long suffered the kind of problems you’d expect for a massive bureaucracy centered on caging tens of thousands of people. The federal population skyrocketed from less than 25,000 in 1980 to nearly 222,000 by 2013. A bipartisan, congressionally mandated report on federal prisons issued in 2016 said the system was in a state of crisis and called for massive changes to the nation’s sentencing policies in order to relieve the strain. Unsurprisingly in an election year, wide changes weren’t implemented.
But on the advice of his attorney, Cohen declined to address specific questions about matters currently under investigation. ABC News
“I respect the prosecutors. I respect the process,” Cohen said. “I would not do or say anything that might be perceived as interfering with their professional review of the evidence and the facts.”
One subject the prosecutors are surely exploring: that $130,000 payment Cohen made to adult-film star Stephanie Clifford, aka Stormy Daniels, less than two weeks before the 2016 election, in exchange for her silence –- a possible violation of campaign finance law. I asked Cohen if the president directed him to make that payment or promised to reimburse him.

He took a short position in shipping company Navigator Holdings worth between $100,001 and $250,000 on Oct. 31, five days after the New York Times contacted him about an article linking Navigator indirectly to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ross told CNBC earlier this week that he also shorted shares in Air Lease and Ocwen Financial. Ross, who plays a key role in increasingly high-stakes trade talks, says those sales were part of divestments made to work in government and he didn’t profit from those transactions. Democratic lawmakers are increasingly concerned, though. Last week, three members of Congress asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate whether Ross violated insider-trading laws.
The strategy reprises last year's successful approach to confirming Justice Neil Gorsuch in the early spring of 2017. Gorsuch was named to fill the vacancy left by the death of Antonin Scalia and then kept open by the refusal of the Senate's Republican majority to consider Merrick Garland, the replacement named by President Barack Obama in 2016. Gorsuch was greeted with delight by abortion opponents, even though he had not ruled directly on Roe in his judicial career. But his confirmation was far from a sure thing because two Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, were seen as defenders of abortion rights.

Veteran actor James Woods was dropped by his “liberal” talent agent on July 4, according to a tweet by the Oscar-nominated actor. “It’s the 4th of July and I’m feeling patriotic,” agent Ken Kaplan wrote, according to a screenshot of the email posted by Woods. “I don’t want to represent you anymore. I could go on a rant but you know what I would say.”
Woods, who is a rare and outspoken President Donald Trump supporter in Hollywood, identified his former agent as a “political liberal.”

Trump’s campaign to limit legal and illegal immigration is driving up wages and salaries for Americans in various locations and careers around the country. The beneficiaries include new employees, African-American bakers in Chicago, Latino restaurant workers in Monterey, Calif., disabled people nationwide, high schoolers, resort workers in Hilton Head, construction workers, Superbowl workers, the garment industry, and workers at small businesses, and even Warren Buffett’s railroad workers. Amnesty advocates rely on business-funded “Nation of Immigrants” push-polls to show apparent voter support for immigration and immigrants. But “choice” polls reveal most voters’ often-ignored preference that CEOs should hire Americans at decent wages before hiring migrants.
A new USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll about patriotism, pegged to this week's celebration of the Fourth of July, finds an overwhelming majority of those surveyed — 90 percent — say they are proud to be Americans. But they split almost down the middle, 42 percent to 39 percent, when asked whether they are proud of America right now. Not surprisingly, the split was along partisan lines: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. There was bipartisan agreement on one thing: Across party lines, roughly seven in 10 agree with the statement, "I feel fatigued watching the news." Elsewhere in politics

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

PORTLAND, Ore. -- Two opposing protest groups -- Patriot Prayer and antifa -- clashed in downtown Portland Saturday, CBS Portland affiliate KOIN reports. Portland police said failure to leave the area could leave to arrests, calling the demonstration a riot. More than 100 members of Patriot Prayer group gathered at Terry Schrunk Plaza for a "freedom rally," while more than 100 counter protesters with an antifa group gathered across the street at Chapman Square for rallies before a march. Police revoked Patriot Prayer's permit for the rally after the two groups began to clash. People were lighting firecrackers and smoke bombs in the crowd while police used flash bangs in an effort to disperse the clashing protesters.
Michigan lawmakers axed a requirement that would make prospective teachers take a basic skills test before earning their certification in Michigan. Rick Snyder signed legislation last week to get rid of the law requiring all prospective teachers to take the SAT to become certified in the state of Michigan, the Detroit Free Press reported. “The basic skills test … is not a strong indicator of how successful a teacher will be,” said Sen. Marty Knollenberg (R-Troy), one of the sponsors of the bipartisan-supported legislation. Knollenberg, who serves as the state Senate Education Committee chair, said the panel made its decision to make it easier for people to become teachers.

During Tuesday's hearing, the judge had the men say no contest as the name of each victim was read.

Delivering a speech in Newcastle on Thursday, he said: “At the moment, protectionism is largely just talk (and tweets). But what if rhetoric becomes reality?”
Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.

Teachers might conceivably prove formidable candidates in suburban swing areas like the one that helped Democrat Ralph Northam win his race for governor in Virginia. And they’re logical torch-bearers for gun control, an issue that galvanized the left after the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Fifteen years ago, Oklahoma was ruled by Democrats — and it could be headed that way again. The Republican surge reached a critical point in 2004 when the GOP took over the Oklahoma House; in 2008, Republicans took control of the Senate, and in 2010 they seized the governor’s office.

Eric Young, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees’ Council of Prison Locals, now prays before he looks at his phone every morning, worried he’ll receive a message from BOP’s director notifying him of a staff death. Young estimates that around two-thirds of his union members were Trump supporters. That makes sense: It’s a law enforcement agency that leans white and male (72 percent male, 62 percent white), and many federal prisons are in rural parts of the country, which Trump dominated. But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau. BOP has long suffered the kind of problems you’d expect for a massive bureaucracy centered on caging tens of thousands of people.

That makes sense: It’s a law enforcement agency that leans white and male (72 percent male, 62 percent white), and many federal prisons are in rural parts of the country, which Trump dominated. But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau. BOP has long suffered the kind of problems you’d expect for a massive bureaucracy centered on caging tens of thousands of people.

Durbin’s advocacy for mass-migration and for younger ‘dreamer’ illegals has caused the Democrats much political pain. He pushed for the abortive budget-shutdown in January 2018, and for the “Gang of Eight” amnesty bill in 2013 which helped the Democrats lose nine seats in 2014. The Democrats’ top leader in the Senate, Sen. Chuck Schumer, is keeping his distance from the “Abolish ICE” campaign. He is instead using his Twitter account to tout Democrats’ promises on healthcare, guns, gay status, and claims that President Donald Trump is tied to Russian President Vladimir Putin. On the Abolish ICE campaign, Schumer is instead calling for a “czar” to focus media attention on “reunifying families.” That topic polls better for Democrats than ending immigration enforcement.
Ramos had an unsuccessful history suing the Gazette: In a 2012 suit, he claimed the newspaper defamed him after a columnist wrote about his 2011 guilty plea to criminal harassment. The suit was dismissed, and an appeals court affirmed the decision. Davis declined to provide details of the letters, but the Baltimore Sun, which first reported the documents, published a copy of one allegedly sent to the law office of the Capital Gazette's former attorney. NBC News has independently confirmed the authenticity of the document. Jarrod W. Ramos mugshot after his arrest on June 28, 2018 in Annapolis, Maryland.
About four years ago, Dais had lined up a Chinese company to help develop its business in nanotechnology that helps produce clean water. Tangredi said the Chinese company persuaded a long-time Dais employee to defect with trade secrets. "They just stole it, and they are using it against us," he said. Tangredi said he hopes the threat of a trade war will force China to rethink its practices: "You've got to do something to get their attention."
Any amount of prescription opioid use was correlated with greater involvement. Among people with prescription opioid use disorder, nearly 20 percent had criminal justice involvement. For heroin users, it was 40 percent. "People who use opioids, including heroin, were up to 13 times more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system," says Winkelman. The study shows the complexity of the the opioid crisis, according to Josiah Rich, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Brown University, who wasn't involved in the research.
"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.
Having started out with a higher than average unemployment rate, Telford has since witnessed the arrival of major American, European and Japanese businesses: notably Hitachi, Denso, Maxell and Ricoh. Together they brought in thousands of high-technology jobs while the neighbouring Birmingham and Black Country conurbation was still rooted predominantly in traditional metal-based industries. Equally, there is no disguising the scale of the challenges the town has faced along the way. Sixteen years ago, the Commons select committee for transport, local government and the regions reported on new towns in general, but this could could easily have been about Telford in particular:
"While many new towns have been economically successful, most are now experiencing major problems. Their design is inappropriate for the 21st century.
You've had Senators Joe Donnelly, Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp, who are the three red state Democrats who voted in favor of Neil Gorsuch, get their only personal meeting with President Trump and who say they are very open to confirming President Trump nominee who -- if the nominee is the right person. So those are the five senators who our attention is going to be really on for the next two months. BRENNAN: And what about immigration, Jan? Do you think this could actually come before the Supreme Court (INAUDIBLE)?

A lawmaker and three legislative staffers have accused Attorney General Curtis Hill of inappropriately touching them during a party on the final night of the legislative session, prompting an investigation by leaders of the Indiana General Assembly. Hill denied the allegations in an emailed statement to IndyStar. Details of the accusations are outlined in a confidential June 18 memorandum prepared by the Taft Stettinius & Hollister law firm at the request of legislative leaders.
Breitbart News, especially, took notice of Nielsen’s role as chairwoman of World Economic Forum’s Global Agenda Council on Risk and Resilience. After Nielsen was nominated to run DHS, Breitbart published several pieces critical of her role in overseeing a 2016 annual report from the Global Agenda Council that directly addressed the worldwide refugee crisis. The report suggested that world leaders should seek to “change the narrative on refugees’ impact in host countries” so that the risks of refugee settlement are downplayed in favor of “the substantial social and economic contribution refugees can make to their host societies.” The report also cited studies showing a positive economic impact of $48 million to the local economy of Cleveland from refugees who had settled there. Work like that drew jeers from some of the right’s loudest voices when Trump nominated Nielsen for the DHS job. Ann Coulter called Nielsen an “open borders zealot.” Former deputy assistant to the president Sebastian Gorka said Nielsen “has a track record before coming into government of being pro-open borders.” Political operative Roger Stone called her “a neocon who likely did not vote for Donald Trump and certainly does not support his non-interventionist worldview.” And Breitbart News has dubbed her, among other things, “Lady DACA” and a “pro-amnesty, Bush bureaucrat.”
But if she lacked the border bona fides prized by the right, she possessed other qualities needed inside a White House lacking discipline and overwhelmed with infighting—namely a directness and and an intense focus.
Mrs May said she would not comment on a leaked report that the government had not yet seen. She said the government would consider it when it received it. (you can read the BBC story on it here)
She then said all donations to the Scottish Conservatives were accepted and declared in accordance with the law after Mr Blackford accused the party of "systematically shielding donations from public scrutiny". Referring to reports on the Ferret website, he alleged the Scottish Conservatives had received £319,000 from the Scottish Unionist Association Trust and said there was no information about who manages the trust, who its donors are or its assets. He urged the prime minister to reveal what checks had taken place before the money was accepted and for an investigation.
That came on the heels of 0.9 percent drop in March, the first monthly drop since July of 2017. Total private construction rose 0.3 percent, with residential projects up 0.8 percent in May. New single-family home construction rose 0.6 percent and the volatile apartment building sector jumped 1.6 percent. Private, non-residential building fell 0.3 percent. Economists are forecasting that construction spending will contribute to overall growth this year even though interest rates are rising.
"If we can work in partnership with them, they actually understand their children far more than we do in the NHS, and they can help us identify the potential children with issues early, but they need to build up understanding," Mr Hunt added. Mental and physical health - why the confusion? The issue of confusion with physical health problems, and a lack of being taken seriously over mental health, was also raised by those interviewed for the programme. One young teacher described her visits to the doctor and their refusal to believe her. Another interviewee called for parity with physical health.
“Some of these articles feature exaggerations or overgeneraliszations [sic]; for example, some claim that China is ‘world No.1’ in certain field.”
The problem with these pieces, the People’s Daily argued in this column, is that “they lack basic facts and deep thought.”
Should Xi implement this reform in the tone of Chinese state media, it would mean a significant change for the typical styles of the nation’s largest publications. In 2017 alone, Chinese state publications proclaimed that the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse scandal proves that “Chinese traditional values” are superior to Western ones; the Soviet Union failed because it lacked “Chinese culture”; and that the West was doomed to fail because Western leaders “always believe in absolute conquest.”
An extensive profile of Xi Jinping in the state outlet Xinhua last year also went out of its way to proclaim that the world is riveted by Xi and his ability to “make things happen,” as evidenced by the “numerous clicks and many thumbs-up on the Internet” his speeches and political commentary garner. The story featured an anecdote about a man who drank some of the ink he was using to translate the Communist Manifesto because “the taste of truth is so sweet.”
Not to be left behind, in December, the People’s Daily proclaimed, “A unique path, a unique theory, a unique system, a unique culture; Xi Jinping’s thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era has developed a rich path for China that has transcended Western-centric theory.”
The growing human rights movement within China has also become one of the most common targets of vitriol for state media. Shortly following the death of Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo last year, the Global Times called Liu and his supporters “losers” and dismissed their lives as a “waste.”
The People’s Daily message this week may be aimed for North Korea as much as it is for China, as Pyongyang prepares for what appears to be inevitable economic profit following dictator Kim Jong-un’s in-person meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. North Korean state media are more vitriolic and exaggerated than their Chinese counterpart, spending much of 2017 threatening a nuclear attack on the United States and sentencing Trump to death.
Nebraska May Join Utah, Idaho in Putting Medicaid Expansion Before Voters
Enlarge this image toggle caption Fred Knapp/NET News Fred Knapp/NET News
Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.
"People who use opioids, including heroin, were up to 13 times more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system," says Winkelman. The study shows the complexity of the the opioid crisis, according to Josiah Rich, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Brown University, who wasn't involved in the research. It shows "the spectrum of the disease and its overlap with the criminal justice system, showing that the more you progress along that continuum, the more likely you are to get tangled up in the criminal justice system." The study also showed that most people with opioid use disorder had other mental illnesses and were also more likely to have certain chronic health conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The study authors argue for the need to engage and involve the criminal justice system in dealing with the opioid epidemic, including reducing overdose deaths.
Trump's scam-dar might be on the fritz: On June 28, former Howard Stern sidekick "Stuttering" John Melendez announced via Twitter that he successfully prank-called President Trumpon Air Force One by impersonating Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), who was acquitted of accepting bribes earlier this year. Melendez added that he'd even passed a phone interview with the president's son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner to suss out what he was calling about (he claimed it was about separating immigrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border). Trump called him back later that day. Melendez later said he was being investigated by the Secret Service and was being represented in the matter by Stormy Daniels' attorney, Michael Avenatti. He later told TMZ, "At the very least, what I did was expose how easy it is to infiltrate the White House.

Jose Arizmendi, 54, a native of Mexico, pleaded guilty in April 1996 to aggravated sexual assault of a child in the District Court of Harris County, Texas … When the Department of Justice filed a complaint in federal court to initiate denaturalization proceedings in February 2015, Arizmendi was serving an 18-year prison sentence in Mexico for a separate sex offense of rape that he committed in that country. Araceli Martinez aka Maria Araceli Ramos de Martinez, 53, a native of Mexico, pleaded guilty in September 2012 to Obtaining Money, Labor or Property by False Pretense in violation of California Penal Code § 532(a) in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles. Between June 2011 and March 2012, Martinez engaged in a scheme in which she impersonated a U.S. immigration officer. Fosia Abdi Adan, 51, a native of Somalia, applied for and received a diversity visa from the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, Yemen, under the Diversity Visa (DV) Program on Jan. 10, 2001, and used her visa to unlawfully obtain beneficiary visas for the below individuals who were ineligible to be beneficiaries. Adan arrived and was admitted to the United States on Jan. 29, 2001, on her diversity immigrant visa as a permanent resident.
There have been numerous reports of concern among ICE agents. “Even the cops don’t like us anymore because they’re listening to the news also,” one ICE agent, who did not want his name used, told the Los Angeles Times. In California, many police departments have a longstanding policy against working with ICE to arrest people on immigration charges. The backlash against ICE has become so heated that senior officials in the agency’s criminal investigative division sent a letter to DHS Secretary Nielsen last month urging an organizational split of ICE. The letter, signed by the majority of special agents in charge of ICE’s Homeland Security Investigative Division (HSI), argued that the Homeland Security Investigative Division and ICE’s other division, Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), should be two separate organizations.
That may be less true in cases where U.S. companies engage in businesses with a ready substitute. Chinese leader Xi Jinping recently hinted that European and Asian conglomerates might soon find themselves benefiting as China punches back against the U.S.

In turn, that means American firms in China could soon find their new product models at the bottom of the regulatory pile for things like safety approvals, or their state-owned Chinese partners might shift resources toward European joint ventures instead. China has a history of this sort of bureaucratic malfeasance, with its consumers often helping out.

Freshman Rep. Moira Jayne Walsh, 27, who has been outspoken about what she sees as a culture of corruption in the State House, lost her party's endorsement to Michael Earnheart, who voted for President Donald Trump. As a safe blue state, Rhode Island rarely gets any national political attention. But Walsh woke up Tuesday to donations from as far away as Texas and California. Party officials describe Earnheart as a "lifelong Democrat" who voted for Trump because he didn’t like Hillary Clinton.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
Bishop John Bauerschmidt, who oversees the Middle Tennessee region of the church, stands firmly by his decision not to authorize their use, nor allow clergy within his diocese to officiate the religious ceremonies or permit the weddings on church property. In doing so, the bishop says he is being faithful to his job of guarding the discipline, faith and unity of the church.

"The teaching that Christian marriage is between a man and a woman is reasonable, traditional, and scriptural," Bauerschmidt said in an email. "There really is nothing remarkable about a Christian bishop who holds to this teaching." While Bishops can place limitations on the use of the marriage liturgies, they must refer couples to a willing diocese if they do not authorize them.

Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease. Two aides who came with him from Oklahoma received massive raises Pruitt was later forced to reverse. He replaced the head of his security detail who wouldn’t let him use lights and sirens to zip around the city like the president. And a top career official was dismissed after he questioned the security justifications for Pruitt’s beefed up, multimillion-dollar protective detail.
ZTE is far from alone. China assembles some 90 percent of the world's smartphones, computers and other electronics. But most of the revenue flows to American companies that supply computer chips and other technology. In the broader economy, Chinese banks, airlines, farms and other industries need U.S. technology from jetliners to drugs to software. What Washington welcomes as a source of well-paid jobs, Chinese leaders consider a dangerous dependence.
Sixteen years ago, the Commons select committee for transport, local government and the regions reported on new towns in general, but this could could easily have been about Telford in particular:
"While many new towns have been economically successful, most are now experiencing major problems. Their design is inappropriate for the 21st century. Their infrastructure is aging at the same rate and many have social and economic problems...
"The new towns are no longer new and many of the quickly-built houses have reached the end of their design life. The master-plans dictated low density developments with large amounts of open space, and housing segregated from jobs, shopping and business services. These created car dependency and are now not considered sustainable.
Infrastructure is supposed to knit us together as a nation, increasing our personal mobility and economic connectivity, but the politics of infrastructure is increasingly exposing our divides. ***
For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
Since I don’t believe in magic, Isaac, that worries me. Can you explain a little bit about the politics of immigration within Mexico? He has been very careful about this topic, and he has been very careful when it comes to Trump. He says he will convince President Trump that it isn’t in his best interest to keep on adding to this nativist rhetoric.
On this much police and activist South Side priest Michael Pfleger can agree: Saturday morning’s anti-violence march on the Dan Ryan Expressway is all about danger. Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.
“We are not going to fight. We are always going to seek for there to be an agreement. … We are going to extend our frank hand to seek a relation of friendship, I repeat, of cooperation with the United States.”
Trump was equally tactful, telling reporters: “I think he’s going to try and help us with the border. “I think the relationship will be a very good one,” the US president said of the Mexican politician, whose swearing-in will be in December. “We talked about trade, we talked about Nafta, we talked about a separate deal, just Mexico and the United States.”
Such restraint contrasted with Trump’s call to López Obrador’s predecessor, weeks after his inauguration last year.
Brayan remains in Maryland, where according to his grandmother he shares a room with 11 other children and is able to make a 20-minute phone call twice a week. The shelter is run the Board of Child Care in Baltimore, which is affiliated with the United Methodist Church, according to the program's website. It launched its migrant-child program in 2014, targeted at the time to unaccompanied minors who came to the U.S., to "offer care, safety, and support to a unique population in need," the agency's website says. ABC News reached out to the Board of Child Care but the agency declined to comment. Cáceres has been told that Brayan might be released around July 4, but, she said she has been given inaccurate or incomplete information before and is skeptical.
Most were in their twenties, and some were couples, but otherwise, they fit no single profile. Only a little information about their fate has trickled out from the secretive North Korean regime. The full explanation of why they were taken remains a mystery. The unexplained state-sponsored crime has shaped Japanese politics, with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe using the abductions to capitalize on anti-North Korean sentiment and advance his political career.

XI ASSERTS TERRITORIAL CLAIMS IN MEETING WITH US DEFENSE SECRETARY
Chinese President Xi Jinping strongly asserted China's determination to defend territory it claims, including in the South China Sea, in a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. While the tone of Mattis' visit to Beijing was largely upbeat, Xi made sure to reinforce his reputation as a fervent nationalist when it comes to issues of sovereignty. Though Xi gave no specifics in his statement, he was largely seen as indicating the South China Sea as well as self-governing Taiwan. China also claims territory held by India and uninhabited East China Sea islands controlled by Japan.
About four years ago, Dais had lined up a Chinese company to help develop its business in nanotechnology that helps produce clean water.

So does a commitment to EPA’s mission," Natural Resources Defense Council President Rhea Suh tweeted. "Pruitt failed miserably on both counts. If his successor puts interests of polluters ahead of protecting public health, they will encounter the same wall of resistance, & meet the same fate." Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., called Pruitt "the worst EPA administrator in the history of the agency." "Instead of protecting our environment and combating climate change, he has worked to protect the interests of the fossil fuel industry and polluters all over the country," Sanders said in a statement.

Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.
Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.

One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. Teachers are also running a ballot measure campaign that would tax the highest income earners for an additional $690 million to spend on schools. “Regardless of political parties, we need people to make a decision about what’s happening in the classroom,” said Marisol Garcia, vice president of the Arizona Education Association. “To limit ourselves and to say ‘only these people are going to support us’ is just not true.”
Teachers can be at a disadvantage compared to wealthier candidates, who tend to have built-in networks of potential donors.
Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.
As motorists pay more to fill their tanks this Independence Day -- with gas prices at a four-year high for the holiday -- safety advocates are urging caution during celebrations that turn deadly on U.S. roadways. The national average for a gallon of gas on Tuesday stood at $2.86, making it the costliest for an Independence Day holiday in four years, according to AAA. That said, the nearly 40 million motorists expected to travel this week will pay 11 cents less per gallon at the pump than they did this past Memorial Day holiday, the motorist club noted. "The national gas price average has held fairly steady for the past 10 days, suggesting that U.S. demand is keeping pace with supply and stabilizing summer gas prices," a spokesperson for the motorist group said in a statement. "However, elevated crude oil prices and other geopolitical concerns could tilt gas prices more expensive in the early fall despite an expected increase in global crude production from OPEC and its partners."
Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
A new USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll about patriotism, pegged to this week's celebration of the Fourth of July, finds an overwhelming majority of those surveyed — 90 percent — say they are proud to be Americans. But they split almost down the middle, 42 percent to 39 percent, when asked whether they are proud of America right now. Not surprisingly, the split was along partisan lines: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. There was bipartisan agreement on one thing: Across party lines, roughly seven in 10 agree with the statement, "I feel fatigued watching the news." Elsewhere in politics

There are fewer than 450 North Atlantic right whales left in the world, and Canada is under international pressure to step up protection of the species, after 12 of the animals were killed last year in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence – many of them in collisions with ships and some after becoming tangled in fishing gear. Scientists believe climate change is causing the species to shift its feeding grounds into the Gulf, putting it on a collision course with the shipping and fishing industries.

Nebraska May Join Utah, Idaho in Putting Medicaid Expansion Before Voters

Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.
The services sector, where most Americans are employed, has now expanded for 101 consecutive months, or more than eight years. The gain was better than many economists had been expecting and depicts an overall economy that appears to be regaining momentum after a slowdown in the winter.
An interactive online HIV prevention program has reduced the sexually transmitted infection rates of gonorrhea and chlamydia by 40 percent among young gay and bisexual men, the first such approach to show an impact on sexual health, a new study found. The program, “Keep It Up!,” challenges traditional sexual education models and seeks to “keep up” HIV negative test results and educate racially and ethnically diverse at-risk gay and bisexual youth through soap operas, interactive games and real-world simulations. The program targets men 18 to 29 who have sex with men, a group that is disproportionately affected by HIV infections in the U.S. While this group represents only 2 percent of all young people, it accounts for 70 percent of HIV diagnoses according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Keep It Up!” is made up of different modules involving interactive games, exercises, a simulation at a bar and a soap opera.
It's difficult to imagine Old Hickory, as he was known, excusing himself from military duty on the grounds that he could not march long distances, as Mr Trump did during the Vietnam War, citing bone spurs. The parallels between the 45th president and the 13th - unlucky for some - are arguably more compelling. Fillmore launched his career in the 1820s with the Anti-Masonic Party, hawking a paranoid rumour that ruling Freemasons were murdering whistleblowers. Mr Trump paved the way for his White House bid by peddling a conspiracy theory, too - that President Barack Obama was not a US citizen.

This is just terrible timing all around." Medicaid, an $11 billion, state-federal health plan in Kentucky, covers 1.4 million people, about 600,000 of them children. The federal government provides about 80 percent of the state's Medicaid funds. The cuts to dental and vision benefits were supposed to affect only able-bodied adults, mostly those added to Medicaid under an expansion authorized through the Affordable Care Act.
Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.

Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.

The United States has always been both a major producer and consumer of oil, which means that most presidents have favored moderate oil prices. High prices hurt motorists and oil consumers across the country.
Of the three laws, the most prominent and most targeted by the Trump administration is SB 54, which California Gov. Jerry Brown signed in October and which went into effect Jan. 1. Provisions of the law bar local law enforcement officials from telling Immigration and Customs Enforcement when they will release certain individuals and from facilitating their transfer in most cases. AB 103 is a provision of a budget bill approved last year that allows the state to review federal detention of immigrants in the state. AB 450, which also went into effect Jan. 1, restricts private employers’ cooperation with federal immigration officials, requiring that businesses notify workers about employment documentation reviews and that immigration officials present a subpoena or warrant to enter workplaces.

Khalaf spent time in a camp for displaced people in northern Iraq before eventually relocating to Germany, where she lives now. Ahmed Khudida Burjus, the deputy director of Yazda, a U.S.-based Yazidi rights group, says around 7,000 women and girls were captured and sold into slavery, with nearly half eventually escaping. In Kocho alone, at least 500 men and boys were killed, and 800 women and girls taken away. The group has documented at least 54 mass graves of Yazidis, but says a lack of resources has delayed the exhumation of the remains, and that there may be more graves yet to be discovered. Over the past three years, Syrian and Iraqi forces have gradually driven IS out of nearly all the territory it once held.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
On this much police and activist South Side priest Michael Pfleger can agree: Saturday morning’s anti-violence march on the Dan Ryan Expressway is all about danger. Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.

That will allow Trump to argue that his tough approach to trade is paying off. There are reasons why the US economy is currently strong, but none of them have anything to do with tariffs on imports. In part, it is the lagged effect of a buoyant global economy in 2017; in part it is explained by tax cuts and the stimulus still being provided by only gently rising interest rates. Mickey Levy, chief US economist for Berenberg, says Trump’s deregulation agenda has been a factor in boosting America’s underlying growth rate. Evidence from Barack Obama’s presidency shows how protectionist policies can backfire.

A marriage between a 41-year-old Malaysian Muslim man and an 11-year-old Thai girl prompted widespread outcry and calls for child brides to be banned as authorities launch an investigation. Che Abdul Karim Che Abdul Hamid secretly married his third wife in Thailand. The marriage was only made known after one of Che Abdul Karim’s wives lodged a complaint with police. The girl in question is set to meet with Malaysian officials Monday to discuss the marriage, authorities said. Deputy Prime Minister Wan Azizah Wan Ismail said the marriage was illegal because it hadn’t been approved by the Shariah court.
The woman who was flown back Thursday said she didn't know if she'd try it again. First, she needed to find out when her partner would be coming back. He was still detained in Texas.

Asked who was waiting for her there, she looked bereft and answered weakly: "No one."
The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year. The prison population has soared by 20% since the 2015 report. Almost half of all prisoners released reoffend and return to prison within two years. “As the government tightens sentencing and bail conditions, and builds more prisons, there is no indication that these trends are likely to change,” Glass said.

And -- but I -- you know, one of the things I think that's really interesting that we've seen in the last year and half is these lower courts take a look at some of the president's policies is that you have federal judges -- one federal judge ruling a whole nationwide program unconstitutional. So a federal judge is essentially -- one federal judge, can be anywhere in the country, is setting federal policy. And the justices are really concerned about that. You saw Justice Thomas last week write separately, saying that the Supreme Court eventually is going to have to take this issue up, these nationwide injunctions being handed down by one federal judge.
A judge ordered federal emergency officials to extend vouchers for temporary hotel housing for nearly 1,700 Puerto Rican hurricane evacuees, saying ending the program could cause irreparable harm.

Earthquakes may now become easier to detect than ever before, with the aid of developing technology. Researchers in Iceland have successfully used an existing fibre-optic communications cable to assess seismic activity. Such cables are laid beneath the ground in countries around the world, to supply internet and television service. The technique has proven sensitive to ground shaking, but is not yet ready for widespread use. It joins a series of recent advances in earthquake sensing, including smartphone apps and more affordable detection hardware.
Most of the incidents involved the amputation of fingers or fingertips, but there were recordings of lost hands, arms or toes. During the period there were a total of 550 serious injuries which cover 22 of the 50 states so the true total for the USA would be substantially higher. Recorded injuries include:
An employee’s left arm had to be surgically amputated at the shoulder after it was pulled into the cubing machine during sanitation
A worker was reaching down to pick up a box to clear a jam when his jacket became caught in a roller. As he tried to pull it out, his hand got pulled in as well. His hand and lower arm were crushed
While an employee was attempting to remove the ribs from the spine of a cattle rib set, his hand made contact with a running vertical band saw and two of his fingers were amputated

Research has consistently shown that Trump won because of racial resentment among white voters. Chris Hayes (@chrislhayes) The modern GOP is basically Steve Bannon, Steve King and Stephen Miller on one side engaged in a project to preserve and enshrine dominance for its ethnic/racial base, and Paul Ryan and John Roberts on the other who pretend they have no idea what they’re up to. While that strategy has worked in the short-term, some Republicans recognize that it can’t work in the long-term, and they’re fighting to save their party from extinction. Can a carbon tax save the GOP? Climate change is one of many issues that divides the Republican Party.
Germany remains haunted by the Nazis' mass murder of Jews in 1933-1945.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) trashed the June jobs report — even though it showed rapid job growth, rising wages, and low unemployment. The report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that employers created 213,000 new jobs in June — 22,000 more than economists had expected. Manufacturing jobs in particular rose by 36,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.

Appointing Amul Thakar to the Supreme Court is an opportunity to make a bold outreach to the most prosperous of America’s immigrant communities and one that is increasingly important politically. The political benefits of naming Thapar are clear. Although Asian voters made up only 4 percent of the electorate in 2016, they are the fastest growing part of the electorate and a key factor in swing states such as Nevada (11 percent of the electorate) and Virginia (7 percent). Although they increasingly lean left, Republicans can get their votes. Nevada GOP Senator Dean Heller narrowly won re-election in 2012 by carrying 54 percent of the Asian vote.
The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.

Cindy Farquhar, postgraduate professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Auckland and senior author of the research, told the Guardian clinics should stop offering women endometrial scratches. “I think it is unreasonable for clinics to ask for patients to pay for something when there is now clear evidence that there is no added benefit,” she said. “I would hope that it will disappear from the list of add-ons that many clinics have both in the UK and in New Zealand and Australia.”
Stuart Lavery, a consultant gynaecologist at Hammersmith Hospital who was not involved in the study, said women who have recurrent implantation failure are hard to treat. “This mini-trauma offered a real potentially exciting way forward and it has become very widely adopted in international practice and in UK practice,” he said.
A medical transcriptionist would usually catch this type of error, notify us in the medical records office, and we’d then place a call to the doctor to confirm which leg they meant. Courtesy Abby Norman Working as a medical records clerk gave me an incredible amount of insight into our health care system -- insight that I now call upon as I adjust to life as a person with chronic illness. Sometimes, though, these errors made it into a patient’s official record, and it wasn’t always because someone just didn’t notice. Staff didn’t always have the proper privileges to make a correction, and if they even viewed a patient record, let alone made alterations to it, they could face disciplinary action. Ideally, computer systems would be able to automate these processes effectively and take humans out of the equation, giving doctors more time with patients.
Michael Avenatti told POLITICO that he's being targeted over his political views. | Seth Wenig/AP Photo Feds target Avenatti over old firm's unpaid taxes U.S. Attorney accuses Trump critic of 'misrepresentations' and 'misconduct.' U.S. Government lawyers are slamming one of President Donald Trump's most prominent critics, attorney Michael Avenatti, over nearly half a million dollars in unpaid federal taxes owed by his former firm. Avenatti's former law firm, Eagan Avenatti LLP, agreed to make the roughly $452,000 tax payment last month in order to resolve a bankruptcy case, but the funds never arrived at the IRS, according to a filing Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, Calif.

The submission from tax lawyers in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles attacks Avenatti personally, accusing him of trying to scam the federal government. "The Debtor and its principle [sic] Michael Avenatti made misrepresentations to the United States that it’s [sic] claim would be fully paid," Assistant U.S. Attorney Najah Shariff wrote.

WASHINGTON – If it's a holiday, it must be time for President Donald Trump to hit the golf course. Right on schedule, the presidential motorcade arrived at the Trump National Golf Club in suburban Virginia in the late morning, the middle of a day that also has the president tweeting and hosting a military-themed picnic later at the White House. As he departed the presidential mansion in the morning, Trump took to Twitter. In addition to a general salutation – "Happy Fourth of July....Our Country is doing GREAT!"
“His ruling was closer to congressional talking points than legal precedent.”
Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center, said that the center doesn’t weigh in on potential judicial appointees, but that open hostility to the agency’s mission would be cause for concern. “Obviously, it would be concerning if there was a justice that was inclined to invalidate the CFPB,” she said. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, renamed the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection under acting director Mick Mulvaney, returned nearly $12 billion to 29 million customers of financial services companies from 2011 to 2017 under its original director, Richard Cordray, an Obama appointee and former Ohio attorney general. But the CFPB’s structure — in fact, its very existence — has been a lightning rod since the agency’s inception. Opponents say not making the CFPB subject to the congressional appropriations process — it’s funded directly by the Federal Reserve — gives it unchecked power; supporters counter that having the central bank as its funding source protects the CFPB from partisan-driven attempts to starve it of resources.

TEHRAN, Iran – Iran on Sunday asked fellow OPEC members to “refrain from any unilateral measures” to increase oil production beyond the 1 million additional barrels of crude a day it already agreed to, a warning to Saudi Arabia after President Donald Trump said the kingdom would increase production. The Iranian warning, in a letter to the United Arab Emirates’ energy minister, comes as Tehran faces a U.S. push to get its allies to stop buying its oil as part of Trump’s decision to pull America from the nuclear deal with world powers. Meanwhile, Iran’s first vice president said the country’s private sector will be able to buy and export crude oil under a new plan to combat U.S. sanctions.

Pruitt said modern mining practices and existing regulations made the financial requirement unnecessary and a burden on mining. — AUTOS: Pruitt's EPA has proposed freezing vehicle fuel-efficiency standards at 2020 levels for the next five years, according to a draft of the proposal obtained by Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del. For new vehicles, that means an average of about 30 miles per gallon instead of rising to 36 mpg by 2025 as Obama's EPA proposed. — OIL AND GAS: More than a dozen states are suing the EPA for failing to take action against leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, from oil and natural gas wells.
The report says metallurgical coal export earnings are also forecast to decline over the next two years, by 5.7% to $35bn in 2018–19, and by another 11% to $32bn in 2019–20, as lower prices offset rising export volumes. Australia's high electricity prices the 'new normal', report says Read more
The metallurgical coal spot price is forecast to decline from an average of US$193 a tonne in 2018 to US$148 a tonne in 2020, with the impacts of improved supply combined with weakening demand from China expected to outweigh growing demand from India. The shadow energy minister, Mark Butler, said the figures from the report were being misrepresented. “Minister Canavan and PM Turnbull may think it’s their job to present this as a booming market, but the Australian people, especially those living and working in thermal coal communities, deserve to be treated with respect and intelligence,” Butler said.

As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
"Jon's record is clear—if it's good for Montana, Jon works with anyone from either party to get things done. If it's bad for Montana, he'll stand up to anyone," Tester spokesman Chris Meagher said. "East Coast developer Matt Rosendale is only looking out for himself and whatever out-of-state special interest group that is propping up his campaign with cash. We can't trust him to defend Montana." But before Trump arrived in Montana, Tester's campaign took out full-page ads in newspapers across the state, highlighting bills the senator sponsored that Trump has signed into law.
But that no-deportations policy would allow many companies to hire illegals instead of Americans. That subsequent rush of migrants would force down wages for Americans and for legal immigrants, force up rents and housing prices, and also overcrowd public K-12 schools.

Trump’s campaign to limit legal and illegal immigration is driving up wages and salaries for Americans in various locations and careers around the country.
He was, in other words, beginning to sound more like his tweets, and perhaps just a bit like Donald Trump. Brennan’s father, Owen, was a blacksmith who immigrated to New Jersey from Ireland in 1948. Owen’s own father, Brennan told me, was “a supporter, an affiliate, say,” of the Irish Republican Army. Brennan moved twice while growing up, from one apartment to another before settling in a three-family house in North Bergen. His grandmother lived on the top floor.
You can’t push any group of people that hard, that fast and for that long and expect them to maintain their composure.”
Eric Young, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees’ Council of Prison Locals, now prays before he looks at his phone every morning, worried he’ll receive a message from BOP’s director notifying him of a staff death. Young estimates that around two-thirds of his union members were Trump supporters. That makes sense: It’s a law enforcement agency that leans white and male (72 percent male, 62 percent white), and many federal prisons are in rural parts of the country, which Trump dominated. But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau. BOP has long suffered the kind of problems you’d expect for a massive bureaucracy centered on caging tens of thousands of people.
It was President Obama who left his party in this position. His anti-business agenda was unpopular, but was never revisited. Democrats’ losses over the past decade stemmed in large part from a slow-growth economy that never gained momentum. Even though he received what he called a “shellacking” in the 2010 midterms, and even though the GOP made unprecedented political gains during his tenure, President Obama was always convinced the country was behind him. As Mara Liasson wrote for NPR in 2016: “During Obama's eight years in office, the Democrats have lost more House, Senate, state legislative and governors seats than under any other president.” She noted that the Obama legacy includes “one huge failure: a diminished Democratic Party.”
In 2013, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., invoked the so-called “nuclear option,” discarding traditional filibuster protections for the minority party in favor of requiring only a simple majority to approve judicial and executive branch nominees.
The Philippine government will demand that peace talks with communist rebels shift from Europe to the Philippines and the insurgents are encamped in designated areas during the negotiations to peacefully settle one of Asia's longest-raging insurgencies. Presidential adviser Jesus Dureza said Thursday that New People's Army guerrillas would also be asked to stop collecting so-called "revolutionary tax" from companies and demanding to be part of a future coalition government. President Rodrigo Duterte's conditions were finalized in a meeting with top military and police officials late Wednesday. They're seen as likely to be rejected by the guerrillas, who fear that holding talks in Manila would expose them — including their Europe-exiled leaders — to military surveillance and harassment. The low-level, rural-based rebellion, which has raged since 1969, has left about 40,000 combatants and civilians dead, hampered security and economic development in the impoverished countryside for nearly half a century.
"Coming from a midwestern state, I think you need to be able to talk to the industrial Midwest. You need to be able to listen to the people there in order to win an election nationwide." Ocasio-Cortez responded on Twitter not much later, touting the midwestern states that Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., won in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary. With respect to the Senator, strong, clear advocacy for working class Americans isn’t just for the Bronx. Sen. Sanders won:
- Michigan
- Minnesota
- Kansas
- Nebraska
- Wisconsin
- Indiana We then lost several of those states in the general.

Infrastructure is supposed to knit us together as a nation, increasing our personal mobility and economic connectivity, but the politics of infrastructure is increasingly exposing our divides. ***
For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
Can a carbon tax save the GOP? Climate change is one of many issues that divides the Republican Party. Like racial resentment, climate denial is a position held mostly by old, white, male conservatives. There’s a climate change generational, ethnic, and gender gap. 61% of Republicans under the age of 50 support government climate policies, compared to just 44% of Republicans over 50.
“These people see in Brexit the chance to turn Britain into the low-wage, deregulated, race-to-the-bottom society of their dreams.

Corbyn told delegates Labour was back as the political voice of the working class. “Labour exists to represent the large majority of the population, the many, not the few, lower and middle income voters, the skilled and unskilled, nurses and teachers, shop floor workers, builders, designers, technicians, professionals in every community, region and nation,” he said.
Spokespeople for the Pentagon and the Army said that, due to the pending litigation, they were unable to explain the discharges or respond to questions about whether there have been policy changes in any of the military branches. Eligible recruits are required to have legal status in the U.S., such as a student visa, before enlisting. More than 5,000 immigrants were recruited into the program in 2016, and an estimated 10,000 are currently serving. Most go the Army, but some also go to the other military branches. To become citizens, the service members need an honorable service designation, which can come after even just a few days at boot camp.

Belfast City Council has become the first council in Northern Ireland to set up a committee specifically to deal with Brexit. The idea was proposed earlier this year, and membership of the committee was confirmed at the council's monthly meeting on Monday night. It will be responsible for "researching, monitoring and reviewing the financial, resource or operational impact" of Brexit on Belfast. Its first meeting will be on 9 August. While the UK as a whole voted to leave the EU in June 2016, a majority in Northern Ireland voted to remain.
POLITICO Playbook: Michael Cohen speaks
NEW YORK, NY - MAY 30: Michael Cohen, (C) former personal lawyer and confidante for President Donald Trump, exits the United States District Court Southern District of New York on May 30, 2018 in New York City. According to a filing submitted to the court Tuesday night by special master Barbara Jones, federal prosecutors investigating Michael Cohen, a longtime personal lawyer and confidante for President Donald Trump, are set to receive 1 million files from three of his cellphones that were seized last month.

BREAKING ...

LONDON — Over the past century American and British troops have fought side-by-side in two World Wars, Korea and the conflicts in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan. But some lawmakers and experts in the United Kingdom are warning that the British military could soon be seen as irrelevant by the United States unless it receives a colossal funding boost. "There is a concern that the U.K. is falling ever further behind and becoming even more useless from a U.S. point of view," said Andrew Dorman, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a think tank in London.
The economy has added an average 207,000 jobs a month this year after a blowout number of 223,000 in May. Economists predict that 195,000 jobs were added in June. Unemployment stands at 3.8%, the lowest rate since 2000. If it dips to 3.7%, it will be the lowest since 1969.
Federal Reserve officials last month said they expect to keep raising interest rates and suggested that by the next year, they could be high enough that they could start slowing growth, according to minutes of their discussion released Thursday. While noting a strong economy, Fed officials appeared vigilant about emerging risks, especially trade tensions, and the dangers of an economy that might overheat. The officials noted heightened concerns from businesses about President Donald Trump's get-tough trade policies and that some executives had already scaled back future spending plans because of the uncertainty. They also said they were monitoring changes in market-set interest rates. A narrowing in the gap between short-term and long-term rates has been an accurate predictor of downturns in the past.
The services sector, where most Americans are employed, has now expanded for 101 consecutive months, or more than eight years. The gain was better than many economists had been expecting and depicts an overall economy that appears to be regaining momentum after a slowdown in the winter.
Practice is only one of Deborah Glass’s 125 recommendations not accepted by Victorian government
Female prisoners in Victoria are still subject to “abusive” routine strip searches, a state government watchdog says. The Victorian ombudsman, Deborah Glass, said the government has failed to adopt a recommendation from her 2015 report into the prison system that called for an end to the searches. “Why has the government not accepted my recommendation to stop the abusive practice of routinely strip-searching women prisoners – in fact, the only recommendation out of 125 not accepted?” she asked on Wednesday. The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year.
They are to consult on detailed plans to restrict the promotion and marketing of foods high in salt, sugar and fat. This would target confectionary, biscuits, crisps, cakes, pastries, sugary soft drinks and potentially ice creams, and include restrictions on multi-buy offers, meal deals, unlimited refill deals and where products can be displayed in shops. Newly appointed public health minister Joe Fitzpatrick said "far too many people" were facing "serious risks to their health" which were "largely avoidable". 'Profound impact'
The new government report states that "the Scottish diet remains stubbornly unhealthy", with the country "far from meeting our dietary goals" - something which has a "profound" impact on health and lifestyle. Problems start early, with the report setting out "alarming" findings on the number of children consuming food and drinks high in fat or sugar - studies suggest 29% of children are at risk of being overweight, half of whom are at risk of obesity.
Even Pruitt’s own staff had begun to sour on him, with many worrying that their future career prospects would be damaged by their association with Pruitt’s tenure. Each scandal seemed more damning than the last. Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.
No one was ever arrested for the blaze, although Fieseler writes about how investigators keyed into one main suspect in the fire — a disgruntled bar patron who'd been kicked out earlier in the day and had been heard threatening to burn the place down. It wasn't until 2003 that a plaque commemorating the fire's victims was laid. New Orleans was a conflicted place for the gay community at the time of the fire, Fieseler says. In some ways, the city was a haven for the gay community where people could be themselves. But there were also raids on gay bars, harassment, and discrimination: "An individual who was quiet and who was closeted gay, could find companionship, could find love and joy, could have a job, could have a house, so long as this individual never spoke the dreaded H.

Rep. Jim Jordan Denies He Knew Of Decades-Long Sexual Abuse At Ohio State

Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, one of the most powerful conservatives in Congress, has denied reports that he ignored the alleged sexual abuse of athletes while he worked as an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University more than 20 years ago. Allegations that Jordan was aware of sexual misconduct and explicitly was informed of specific incidents of alleged assault by the wrestling team's doctor, first surfaced in an NBC news story on Tuesday. But Jordan — who was an assistant coach from 1987 until 1995, when he was elected to the state legislature — has refuted the claims. "Congressman Jordan never saw any abuse, never heard about any abuse, and never had any abuse reported to him during his time as a coach at Ohio State," Ian Fury, Jordan's spokesman, said in a statement. "He has not been contacted by investigators about the matter but will assist them in any way they ask, because if what is alleged is true, the victims deserve a full investigation and justice."Rep.

PORTLAND, Ore. -- Two opposing protest groups -- Patriot Prayer and antifa -- clashed in downtown Portland Saturday, CBS Portland affiliate KOIN reports. Portland police said failure to leave the area could leave to arrests, calling the demonstration a riot. More than 100 members of Patriot Prayer group gathered at Terry Schrunk Plaza for a "freedom rally," while more than 100 counter protesters with an antifa group gathered across the street at Chapman Square for rallies before a march. Police revoked Patriot Prayer's permit for the rally after the two groups began to clash. People were lighting firecrackers and smoke bombs in the crowd while police used flash bangs in an effort to disperse the clashing protesters.
Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.

It’s shocking that Mr. James is surprised by the positive economic results of less regulation and lower taxes.
"Peace and tranquility are the fruits of justice," Lopez Obrador said. Exit polling by Consulta Mitofsky for the Televisa network forecast gubernatorial wins for allies of Lopez Obrador's Morena party in at least four of eight state races on the ballot plus for the head of government in Mexico City. The central state of Guanajuato was expected to go to a candidate of the conservative National Action Party. Mitofsky predicted Morena allies would take between 56 and 70 seats in the 128-member Senate and between 256 and 291 spots in the 500-seat lower house. "The anger that the average Mexican feels toward the way things are being governed has favored Lopez Obrador," said Shannon O'Neil, senior fellow for Latin America Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.
Barbara is constantly being interrupted by pop-ups about the new GDPR. Is there anything she can do? Because of GDPR, it feels as though my internet access – my access to information – is now more restricted. I am constantly being interrupted by pop-ups that want me to agree to the website’s privacy policy, use of my data and so on, in order to “personalise my experience”. After recent revelations about unauthorised use of personal data, I’m wary of agreeing without checking what their proposals are, but I often just close the page because there are too many options and it’s too much of a bother.
"The national gas price average has held fairly steady for the past 10 days, suggesting that U.S. demand is keeping pace with supply and stabilizing summer gas prices," a spokesperson for the motorist group said in a statement. "However, elevated crude oil prices and other geopolitical concerns could tilt gas prices more expensive in the early fall despite an expected increase in global crude production from OPEC and its partners." AAA
Those elevated prices were in play in commodity markets on Tuesday, with global supply concerns pushing crude-oil futures above $75 a barrel for the first time since 2014, with outages reported in Libya, Canada and Venezuela. Holiday driving can also be costly in ways that hit more than one's bank account.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) tweeted a still more vague yet somehow more expansive vision Tuesday, calling for “restructuring the agencies that enforce our immigration laws, including ICE.”
Such aspirationalism allows establishment Democrats to harness the power behind the idea of abolishing ICE without taking a meaningful position on the underlying goal that animates that movement ― to radically undercut the government’s deportation efforts.
He initially explained that the meeting was held to discuss Russian adoptions, which were suspended after the US announced sanctions on Russia in 2012. But emails showed that he decided to attend the meeting after being offered damaging information about Hillary Clinton. He and President Trump have since described the meeting as "opposition research" that any politician would engage in. Eric Trump

Fox News again dominated for the second quarter of 2018 not only in cable news, but in all of cable, while CNN landed in last place by a country mile. For the eighth straight quarter, Fox was the most-watched network in all of cable. With an average of 1.409 million total day viewers, Fox attracted nearly as many eyeballs as MSNBC and CNN combined. MSNBC averaged just 930,000 viewers, while CNN nosedived with an average of just 658,000. During primetime, Fox snagged an average of 2.447 million viewers, compared to MSNBC’s 1.736 million.
Despite the ban, police allowed the organizers to read a press statement. “We do not recognize this ban,” the group said in the statement read out loud by a volunteer, calling the prohibition imposed by Istanbul’s governor “comical.”
Police told the crowd to disperse after the statement, warning “otherwise, we will intervene.” Officers patrolled with dogs and had water cannons stationed nearby. They fired tear gas on groups in some areas and were seen elsewhere pushing and shouting at participants who were too slow to scatter. March organizers said Friday that the governor had prohibited the march in violation of the right to freedom of assembly. The governor has cited security reasons and public “sensitivities” as grounds for barring LGBTI marches since 2015.
The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”

Hamilton, the Republican state lawmaker who beat the incumbent Karnes, won with a mix of support from teachers and other unions. While Karnes sparred with teachers during the strike, Hamilton took a moderate position. He aligned with teachers unions by opposing state right-to-work legislation and the proposed repeal of prevailing wage laws for public construction projects. The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.

Corporate America couldn’t hire Republican lobbyists fast enough after President Donald Trump’s election gave the GOP unified control of Washington. Now there are signs that Democrats are back in demand. Companies and trade groups are trying to hire congressional staffers with ties to influential House Democrats four months ahead of the midterm elections, in which Democrats are expected to pick up seats and potentially retake control of the House. Lobbyists are helping their clients meet with the Democrats who would become committee chairs if the party does win back the chamber. And trade groups are talking to members about what to expect from a Democratic takeover.
Watts was transported to a nearby hospital, where 85 to 90 percent of his body was found to have been burned, Georgia State Patrol told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Authorities said Watts, upset with the federal agency designated to aid veterans, attached a homemade incendiary device and fireworks to his body before pouring liquid on himself. He then ignited the fluid. VETERAN PROTESTING TREATMENT BY VA SETS HIMSELF ON FIRE NEAR GEORGIA STATE CAPITOL, POLICE SAY

The commissioner added a Capitol trooper "actually put him out with his fire extinguisher."
Even Pruitt’s own staff had begun to sour on him, with many worrying that their future career prospects would be damaged by their association with Pruitt’s tenure. Each scandal seemed more damning than the last. Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.

In its statement, Delancey said it remained committed to ensuring the continued maintenance of the centre but added that it was over 50 years old, “and as is often the way with older buildings, some elements do unfortunately fail”. The delay in repairing the escalator was because it was so old, spare parts were no longer made and had to be specially manufactured, the spokeswoman said. The shopping centre has long attracted scorn and been dismissed as an eyesore – not least because of its “manky, hot-pink” exterior, as Time Out once put it – but some see that as part of its charm, with the Guardian’s property section once describing it approvingly as the “anti-Westfield”. Now its traders and patrons fear it is going to be flipped from one extreme to the other, with chain stores filling the new commercial units to match the new luxury flats.

The hosts are meant to be outrageous, required to to offend. Dean chuckled along as Leyonhjelm said Hanson-Young “has the right to shag as many men as she likes”. This show appears designed to be unfair and ugly and angry. It has nothing to do with “basic human decency”, so it is far easier to scapegoat a junior producer than admit the program was working entirely as planned. A day later, the hosts issued an on-air apology, saying the senator had crossed a line and seeking to disassociate themselves from “unverified rumour and innuendo” about Hanson-Young’s private life.

XI ASSERTS TERRITORIAL CLAIMS IN MEETING WITH US DEFENSE SECRETARY
Chinese President Xi Jinping strongly asserted China's determination to defend territory it claims, including in the South China Sea, in a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. While the tone of Mattis' visit to Beijing was largely upbeat, Xi made sure to reinforce his reputation as a fervent nationalist when it comes to issues of sovereignty. Though Xi gave no specifics in his statement, he was largely seen as indicating the South China Sea as well as self-governing Taiwan. China also claims territory held by India and uninhabited East China Sea islands controlled by Japan.

Any amount of prescription opioid use was correlated with greater involvement. Among people with prescription opioid use disorder, nearly 20 percent had criminal justice involvement. For heroin users, it was 40 percent. "People who use opioids, including heroin, were up to 13 times more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system," says Winkelman. The study shows the complexity of the the opioid crisis, according to Josiah Rich, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Brown University, who wasn't involved in the research.

“The same sort of thing is true for a place like New York,” Frey added. “There has always been huge movement going from New York to Florida, but during the Great Recession period that slowed up quite a bit, and now it is picking up again.”
Frey added that the reasons behind the decline in population in cities like Los Angeles and New York -- overcrowding and high prices -- are very different than the reasons for decreases in other cities on this list, notably Rust Belt cities like Flint, Michigan; Toledo, Ohio; and Rockford, Illinois; and even larger cities like St. Louis, Cleveland, and Milwaukee. These cities have been losing domestic migrants for decades due to stagnating economic conditions stemming from the decline of American manufacturing. Methodology

Economists have warned the import tariffs could disrupt the supply chain, undermine business investment and raise prices for consumers, and wipe out the stimulus from a $1.5 trillion tax cut package that came into effect in January. “As with the manufacturing report released on Tuesday, there was plenty of anecdotal evidence that tariffs were beginning to have an impact, but with the prices balance falling in June and new export orders rising, there is little sign that this is affecting the economy yet,” said Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York. TRUCK DRIVER SHORTAGE
Services industries also complained about difficulties finding qualified workers, especially truck drivers, which some said was “getting worse each month.” There are a record 6.7 million unfilled jobs. The ISM survey’s measure of service industry employment slipped in June, but continued to show growth. Some industries said they “need to hire more people,” and others noted that “employee retention is getting much more competitive.”
Separately, the ADP National Employment Report showed private employers hired 177,000 workers in June, less than market expectations for a 190,000 gain.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections.

A senior Pentagon official during the Obama administration, Denmark worries that with President Trump's suspension of a major military exercise with South Korea next month, North Korea's already gotten a lot and given up very little. "Kim Jong Un did not make any new commitments in Singapore, and so the secretary of state is now forced to go into Pyongyang, trying to secure something that the president was not able to," says Denmark. "The real question is whether Kim Jong Un is genuinely interested in denuclearization." Trump, for one, apparently thinks he is. "I made a deal with him.

The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. Teachers are also running a ballot measure campaign that would tax the highest income earners for an additional $690 million to spend on schools. “Regardless of political parties, we need people to make a decision about what’s happening in the classroom,” said Marisol Garcia, vice president of the Arizona Education Association. “To limit ourselves and to say ‘only these people are going to support us’ is just not true.”

Jeff Burke, APS director of resources planning, says customers would see 6 to 14 percent per year increases on their bills if the company is forced to ratchet up renewable use ahead of schedule. "We continue to add renewables to our system, but they have to make sense," Burke said. "It's not really about a target, it's about what makes sense for our customers' usage and what makes rates affordable and what keeps our system reliable." Thirty-two states with renewable standards didn't have, on average, a correlated rate increase, according to Wesley Hersche, an associate director of research with Arizona State University's Global Security Initiative. "These issues involve a complex interaction of factors, and we should be careful not to oversimplify things," Hersche wrote in April.

The New York Times reported Monday that the letters, sent last month to leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Prime Minister Charles Michel of Belgium, rebuked NATO allies for not spending enough on their own defense ― a criticism that Trump has repeatedly leveled against other alliance members. The president also suggested in the letters that the U.S. would consider reducing its military commitment globally if its allies don’t ramp up spending, reported the Times. In his letter to Merkel, Trump reportedly wrote: “There is growing frustration in the United States that some allies have not stepped up as promised. The United States continues to devote more resources to the defense of Europe when the Continent’s economy, including Germany’s, are doing well and security challenges abound.
Abbott said on Tuesday night he never conceived of climate change as a moral challenge. “It was an issue, that’s all, and – at least on the actual changes we’ve so far seen – not a very significant one compared to man’s inhumanity to man; maintaining and improving living standards; and even to many other environmental issues such as degraded bush and waterways, particulate pollution, water quality in the third world, deforestation and urban overcrowding.”
He contended that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide from roughly 300 to 400 parts per million over the last century had not triggered “dramatic consequences”. Play Video 0:32 Andrew Probyn calls Tony Abbott 'destructive' in ABC report – video
“Storms are not more severe; droughts are not more prolonged; floods are not greater; and fires are not more intense than a century ago – despite hyperventilating reportage and over-the-top claims from Green politicians,” he said. “Sea levels have hardly risen and temperatures are still below those of the medieval warm period. Over time, temperature change seems to correlate rather more with sun spot activity than with carbon dioxide levels.
Despite the current growth prospects and inflation finally reaching the Fed's goal of 2 percent annual gains in prices, the minutes noted a number of "risks and uncertainties" facing the economy. Officials said that the risks associated with trade policy had "intensified," with the uncertainty potentially hurting business sentiment and investment spending." The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and has also threatened to impose tariffs on billions of dollars in other Chinese products including tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese goods which are scheduled to take effect on Friday. Beijing has promised to retaliate with tariffs on U.S. goods, including farm products such as soybeans. Trump has staked out a tougher approach on trade in an effort to achieve his goal of dramatically shrinking America's huge trade deficits, which he has blamed for the loss of millions of U.S. factory jobs.
That's more than all but three Democratic senators (Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana), all of whom are from red states and facing re-election this fall. "I think he's terrific," Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., who also faces a tough re-election fight, said in an interview. "It's harder work when you're not interested in voting the party line. You've got to look at every issue from all sides."

The services sector, where most Americans are employed, has now expanded for 101 consecutive months, or more than eight years. The gain was better than many economists had been expecting and depicts an overall economy that appears to be regaining momentum after a slowdown in the winter.
San Francisco became the first California city to implement a $15 minimum wage ordinance for all businesses on July 1. The union-backed “Fight for $15” claimed Seattle as the first city to pass a $15 minimum wage ordinance in June 2014. The movement created a groundswell, and 17 percent of Americans will live in a metropolitan area or a state with a $15 minimum wage by 2023, including the State of California. Bay Area Labor Council union leaders, elected officials, and social justice activists that worked to pass Proposition J in 2014 with the support of 77 percent of voters celebrated in a Friday afternoon rally at City Hall. There were lots of speeches claiming that the “Fight for $15’”movement has economically and socially benefited 142,000 workers.
Any amount of prescription opioid use was correlated with greater involvement. Among people with prescription opioid use disorder, nearly 20 percent had criminal justice involvement. For heroin users, it was 40 percent. "People who use opioids, including heroin, were up to 13 times more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system," says Winkelman. The study shows the complexity of the the opioid crisis, according to Josiah Rich, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Brown University, who wasn't involved in the research.

In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners. Alas, he is wasting his time trying to shift the views of the Democratic Party, which has become ever more left-wing, if not outright socialist. I think it is time for Mr. James to become a Republican. Guy Randolph

It’s shocking that Mr. James is surprised by the positive economic results of less regulation and lower taxes.
But, unlike the wind industry which has settled on a three-blade design, underwater designers are also testing four and six-bladed versions too. OpenHydro, already deployed in Canada’s Bay of Fundy, use giant 16m hoops with inward-pointing blades that resemble the mouth of a giant lamprey fish. Its makers opened the world’s first tidal turbine manufacturing plant in Cherbourg last week. There are also vertical turbines that spin like a fairground carousel, such as Hydroquest in France and LHD in China, and one company is even making an undulating membrane inspired by swimming fish. Capturing wave power is even more challenging than tapping the tides – “survivability” is the key term in this sector.
There never was a rational reason for creating a “buffer zone.” This attendance status allowed enrollment at either Central or South high schools. Hinsdale High School District 86 history shows that buffer zone residents chose Central attendance at a 9 to 1 ratio compared to the choice for South. Yes, it is a fact that buffer zone status did increase property values.The two board members voting not to eliminate buffer zone status live within those attendance boundaries. This June 1, a discrimination complaint was filed against District 86 with the United States Office of Civil Rights. The complaint cites (1) unlawful discrimination due to fixing unlawful attendance boundaries, (2) continued expansion of those boundaries, as well as (3) curricular disparity between the two high schools.

LONDON — Over the past century American and British troops have fought side-by-side in two World Wars, Korea and the conflicts in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan. But some lawmakers and experts in the United Kingdom are warning that the British military could soon be seen as irrelevant by the United States unless it receives a colossal funding boost. "There is a concern that the U.K. is falling ever further behind and becoming even more useless from a U.S. point of view," said Andrew Dorman, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a think tank in London.
In his first loss — by a mere 0.56 percent to conservative Felipe Calderon in 2006 — his supporters held months-long protests in Mexico City and he referred to himself as "the legitimate president." His allies are warning even before Sunday's presidential vote that there better not be any funny business. "They shouldn't dare commit a fraud, because if they do they will meet the devil," said Yeidckol Polevnsky, president of Lopez Obrador's Morena party. "We will not accept it." Still, the voting Sunday was by and large peaceful, apart from the usual complaints about some volunteer-staffed polling places opening late.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) spent a total of $4 billion on improper food stamp payments to those receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the USDA confirmed with Breitbart News on Friday. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service announced this week that improper payments made up 6.3 percent of SNAP money in the fiscal year (FY) 2017—the latest data available from the agency. Breitbart News analyzed the USDA’s data on food stamp spending and found that $4,007,026,532 of the $63,603,595,754 the agency spent on SNAP in FY 2017 went to improper payments. The USDA told Breitbart News that “it is important to note that improper payments include both overpayments and underpayments,” meaning that households on SNAP that received less than what they were supposed to receive for the month are also included in the percentage rate. Brandon Lipps, the Acting Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services at the agency, said that most improper payments are due to “human errors”—either because of state agencies miscalculating benefits or benefit recipients giving state agencies the wrong information.The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) spent a total of $4 billion on improper food stamp payments to those receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the USDA confirmed with Breitbart News on Friday.
Five children 15 and younger were among 23 people shot during a scorching weekend in Chicago. From Friday afternoon to early Monday, 21 people were wounded and two people were killed, including a 14-year-old boy who was shot early Saturday while walking in the Washington Park neighborhood, according to police. About nine hours earlier, another 14-year-old boy was shot in the Loop. He was coming up stairs at the corner of Wabash Avenue and Wacker Drive when he was shot in the leg Friday evening, police said. Late Sunday night, three girls ages 5, 14 and 15 were shot while sitting in a parked car with their mother in the East Garfield Park neighborhood, police said.

We look at other parts of the world, where women are not allowed to vote, or dance, and we see ourselves as modern and liberated.

Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.

And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday. “I can’t predict anything right now, but we’re taking a page from the civil rights movement. When nothing else was working, civil disobedience is what eventually made authorities and the government listen.”
Law enforcement officials have asked Pfleger to reconsider, saying the protesters are putting their lives on the line by walking onto a busy expressway. In fact, Illinois State police troopers, who have jurisdiction over Chicago expressways, will try to stop protesters from getting on the Dan Ryan — and arrests will be made, if necessary.

Despite no signs of North Korea abandoning its nuclear weapons any time soon, South Korea is literally bouncing ahead this week with peace efforts with its rival, which was threatening war just months ago. Two days of friendly basketball games winding up Thursday in Pyongyang were the latest in a slew of goodwill gestures between the Koreas in recent months. The women's and men's matches came just ahead of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's arrival in North Korea on Friday for two days of talks over the future of the North's nuclear program. A capacity crowd of 12,000 applauded as the teams — dressed in white jerseys that read "Peace" and green jerseys that read "Prosperity" — marched onto the court holding hands. Players from the North and South were mixed into teams for Wednesday's games.

“This was probably the best term that conservatives had in the supreme court maybe in my lifetime,” he said. The term might provide only “a very, very modest preview” of waves of conservative rulings to come, however, because a locked-down conservative majority would likely inspire rightwing activists to bring increasingly aggressive cases, said Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. “It’s not just that justice Kennedy’s successor is likely going to move the court to the right,” Vladeck said.
Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left a demoralized agency where staff fear their ability to protect public health is diminished
Scott Pruitt is out but his impact on the environment will be felt for years
Scott Pruitt, who has finally stepped down as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency after a long-rumbling corruption scandal, rose to public prominence on the back of a series of increasingly outlandish ethical controversies. Scott Pruitt resigns: Trump's scandal-ridden EPA chief steps down Read more
From lobbying fast food company Chick-fil-A on behalf of his wife, to demanding his staff acquire a mattress from a Trump Hotel – not to mention the millions of taxpayer dollars spent on security, first-class travel and soundproof booths – Pruitt’s behavior clashed spectacularly with any pretense of Trump’s pledge to “drain the swamp” in Washington. But the lasting legacy of the former Oklahoma attorney general – who was picked by Trump after crusading against what he called the EPA’s “activist agenda” – is likely to be felt in the systematic weakening of environmental regulations. While not as eye-catching as, for example, his demand that his official vehicle use sirens so he could reach a French restaurant on time, Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left behind a demoralized agency where staff fret that their ability to protect public health has been diminished. A staunch ally of oil and gas companies, Pruitt stacked EPA advisory boards with industry representatives and sought to set aside whole troves of research that link pollution to various illnesses.

Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.

Abbott said on Tuesday night he never conceived of climate change as a moral challenge. “It was an issue, that’s all, and – at least on the actual changes we’ve so far seen – not a very significant one compared to man’s inhumanity to man; maintaining and improving living standards; and even to many other environmental issues such as degraded bush and waterways, particulate pollution, water quality in the third world, deforestation and urban overcrowding.”
He contended that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide from roughly 300 to 400 parts per million over the last century had not triggered “dramatic consequences”. Play Video 0:32 Andrew Probyn calls Tony Abbott 'destructive' in ABC report – video
“Storms are not more severe; droughts are not more prolonged; floods are not greater; and fires are not more intense than a century ago – despite hyperventilating reportage and over-the-top claims from Green politicians,” he said. “Sea levels have hardly risen and temperatures are still below those of the medieval warm period. Over time, temperature change seems to correlate rather more with sun spot activity than with carbon dioxide levels.

XI ASSERTS TERRITORIAL CLAIMS IN MEETING WITH US DEFENSE SECRETARY
Chinese President Xi Jinping strongly asserted China's determination to defend territory it claims, including in the South China Sea, in a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. While the tone of Mattis' visit to Beijing was largely upbeat, Xi made sure to reinforce his reputation as a fervent nationalist when it comes to issues of sovereignty. Though Xi gave no specifics in his statement, he was largely seen as indicating the South China Sea as well as self-governing Taiwan. China also claims territory held by India and uninhabited East China Sea islands controlled by Japan.
President Donald Trump is not responsible for the killing of journalists in Annapolis last week. His belittling of the press — his “enemy of the American people” taunts, his promises to roll back libel laws, his fomenting rage toward specific journalists at rallies — is worth mentioning within the context of the murders, because it speaks to a larger concern that last Thursday’s attack on The Capital Gazette won’t be an isolated incident. Journalists, many of whom already risk their lives covering war and violence, many of whom receive death threats regularly, feel understandable jitters about a leader who tries to turn the American public against us, particularly when we watch a member of that public shoot up a newsroom and end five lives. It’s reckless and inaccurate, though, to pin the shootings on Trump. The suspect swore an oath to kill a Capital writer who wrote about him in 2011.
Those factories are the core of an American operation that employs about 136,000 people, but they're also dependent on components sourced overseas for reasons of cost or availability. About 70 percent of the parts in a U.S.-built Camry, the country's best-selling car, come from domestic suppliers. Toyota on June 27 said that Trump's threatened 25 percent tariff on automotive imports would add $1,800 to the price of each sedan. The carmaker's warning of the dangers of tit-for-tat tariffs was just one of many. German lighting manufacturer Osram Licht's shares plunged 22 percent Thursday after it announced a weaker outlook due to trade tensions.
The court documents detail the accounts of four unnamed women, identified as Jane Does 1, 2, 3, and 4. Local reports cited depositions that Large took before his death wherein he reportedly admitted to suggesting some of the women participate in "catfight videos" for money, but he denied the claims of sexual assault. Now his five of his former supervisors, police department, and Horry County officials are facing claims from two of the victims, Jane Does 3 and 4, for allegedly failing to prevent years of egregious abuse. Large died in January, 16 months after he was indicted. On Monday, a judge rejected a motion for summary judgment from the defendants and decided the case would move forward with a trial against the Horry County Police Department and Horry County.
“They’ve twisted American values,” she said in a follow-up phone interview. “A lot of them are anti-God, anti-religion and anti-military.”
In the survey, most say they are proud to be Americans, although Republicans feel that way more strongly (90 percent) than Democrats (61 percent). There is no consensus when asked about the country’s current course, though: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. “Overwhelming majorities of those in both parties and independents agree that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.”” USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll

About four years ago, Dais had lined up a Chinese company to help develop its business in nanotechnology that helps produce clean water. Tangredi said the Chinese company persuaded a long-time Dais employee to defect with trade secrets. "They just stole it, and they are using it against us," he said. Tangredi said he hopes the threat of a trade war will force China to rethink its practices: "You've got to do something to get their attention."
The University of Missouri is still facing enrollment and budgetary problems, including a $49 million budget shortfall, as a result of the 2015 social justice protests that caught national media attention. Many people remember the high-pitched yell of former University of Missouri professor Melissa Click. Click found herself at the center of weeks of unrest at the University of Missouri in 2015 and 2016. Click rose to infamy after a video of her calling for a student photojournalist to be physically removed from campus simply because he was documenting the protests. The protests involved accusations by students that the administration had mishandled several alleged racial issues on campus.
As they were looking around, they noticed a moose at the pond and they both said how amazing it would be if that was the backdrop to their wedding photos. Sure enough, just before the couple’s first kiss as husband and wife, they heard something behind them. ‘I start seeing guests kind of looking that way and I’m just wondering what the commotion is and I look over and I see people kind of moving really fast and I see a moose right there.’ Shandy said the moose seemed more curious than aggressive, but everyone, including the pastor, made sure to be cautious of their surroundings.”

Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
Pentagon Questioned Over Blackout On War Zone Troop Numbers

For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.
No one was ever arrested for the blaze, although Fieseler writes about how investigators keyed into one main suspect in the fire — a disgruntled bar patron who'd been kicked out earlier in the day and had been heard threatening to burn the place down. It wasn't until 2003 that a plaque commemorating the fire's victims was laid. New Orleans was a conflicted place for the gay community at the time of the fire, Fieseler says. In some ways, the city was a haven for the gay community where people could be themselves. But there were also raids on gay bars, harassment, and discrimination: "An individual who was quiet and who was closeted gay, could find companionship, could find love and joy, could have a job, could have a house, so long as this individual never spoke the dreaded H.
Nuclear wouldn't count toward the 50 percent mandate, and APS says its Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station is the largest electricity producer in the U.S.
Jeff Burke, APS director of resources planning, says customers would see 6 to 14 percent per year increases on their bills if the company is forced to ratchet up renewable use ahead of schedule. "We continue to add renewables to our system, but they have to make sense," Burke said. "It's not really about a target, it's about what makes sense for our customers' usage and what makes rates affordable and what keeps our system reliable." Thirty-two states with renewable standards didn't have, on average, a correlated rate increase, according to Wesley Hersche, an associate director of research with Arizona State University's Global Security Initiative. "These issues involve a complex interaction of factors, and we should be careful not to oversimplify things," Hersche wrote in April.

Maryanne Trump Barry, the president's sister, served with him until her retirement. He drove a taxi to get through law school, and his degrees from Notre Dame and Georgetown give him a non-Ivy League appeal. Minuses: His star appears to be fading. A limited paper trail on the appeals court worries some conservatives. He is not known as a great legal theorist like Kavanaugh, nor is he a "feeder judge" whose law clerks are snapped up by Supreme Court justices.
There have been numerous reports of concern among ICE agents. “Even the cops don’t like us anymore because they’re listening to the news also,” one ICE agent, who did not want his name used, told the Los Angeles Times. In California, many police departments have a longstanding policy against working with ICE to arrest people on immigration charges. The backlash against ICE has become so heated that senior officials in the agency’s criminal investigative division sent a letter to DHS Secretary Nielsen last month urging an organizational split of ICE. The letter, signed by the majority of special agents in charge of ICE’s Homeland Security Investigative Division (HSI), argued that the Homeland Security Investigative Division and ICE’s other division, Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), should be two separate organizations.
“After all, it’s just a computer algorithm that’s just spitting all this out to begin with, based on so-called comparable sales.”
Liberated in March from immigration detention, where disease and threats were allegedly rife, he had been sent to a city ravaged by decades of civil war and terror. He told me his story but asked for his real name to be withheld as he feared being targeted by the Islamist al-Shabab group because of his work warning young people in the US about the dangers of recruitment by Somali militants. 'TB contracted in detention'
Six months earlier, in a small town in Minnesota - which is home to the largest population of Somalis living in the US - it was dawn when Ahmed was driving his daughter to nursery. He noticed a large vehicle with tinted windows beginning to follow him. It seems officers from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) had been watching him closely and, after getting him to pull over, he was shackled and taken into custody.
"For a good few years we did see a decrease in the number of young people reportedly taking substances. "But over the last 12 to 18 months we have seen a slight increase."
Just hours after his historic election victory sent thousands of supporters pouring on to the streets, the 64-year-old leftist tweeted that he had received a call from Donald Trump. “I proposed that we explore an integral agreement of development projects, which generate jobs in Mexico and with that reduce migration and improve security. There was respectful treatment and our representatives will speak more.”
In an interview with the Televisa news network, López Obrador emphasized the need for mutual respect and cooperation between the two neighbors. “We are conscious of the need to maintain good relations with the United States. We have a border of more than 3,000 kilometers, more than 12 million Mexicans live in the United States.
Kinner was being held without bail at the Ada County jail on 15 charges, including six of injury to a child and nine of aggravated battery, jail records showed. There was no lawyer listed for Kinner in the records. Kinner may have wanted to “extract vengeance” for being kicked out by a tenant who took him in, Police Chief Bill Bones said at a press conference on Sunday. The woman who took Kinner in was not harmed and was not at the residence at the time of the attack. Kinner assaulted the children at the party after he was unable to find the woman, police said, adding his motive was still under investigation.
There never was a rational reason for creating a “buffer zone.” This attendance status allowed enrollment at either Central or South high schools. Hinsdale High School District 86 history shows that buffer zone residents chose Central attendance at a 9 to 1 ratio compared to the choice for South. Yes, it is a fact that buffer zone status did increase property values.The two board members voting not to eliminate buffer zone status live within those attendance boundaries. This June 1, a discrimination complaint was filed against District 86 with the United States Office of Civil Rights. The complaint cites (1) unlawful discrimination due to fixing unlawful attendance boundaries, (2) continued expansion of those boundaries, as well as (3) curricular disparity between the two high schools.
Yet those people were served. And since it is in Virginia, was Sanders even the first member of the Trump administration to eat there? Maybe others less recognizable had already come and gone. As for “compassion,” what compassion are you showing for someone who, for all you know, may struggle with certain elements of her job herself? What compassion are you showing in a country where the Supreme Court just ruled on gay customers being denied services in a cake shop, yet your gay staff members want you to refuse service to someone they don’t like?
He aligned himself with most of his Democratic colleagues against Gina Haspel, Trump's pick for CIA director, arguing that her record on enhanced interrogation techniques was unacceptable. And instead of focusing on a politically safe issue in his maiden Senate floor speech, Jones struck a nerve by calling for a dialogue on gun violence after the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida. In addition, during the campaign, Jones made no secret of his desire to protect LGBTQ rights and to support a woman's right to abortion. It's those kinds of positions that have made him a darling of Alabama's progressive minority — and somewhat of a public enemy among the state's conservative majority. Jones has introduced four pieces of legislation — none of any huge significance — since he arrived on Capitol Hill, including two agriculture bills, one that would expand access to capital for rural job creators and the last seeking to mandate an annual Medicaid expansion review.
He said he supports the project and wants to see it succeed “more than anybody.”

Durbin’s advocacy for mass-migration and for younger ‘dreamer’ illegals has caused the Democrats much political pain. He pushed for the abortive budget-shutdown in January 2018, and for the “Gang of Eight” amnesty bill in 2013 which helped the Democrats lose nine seats in 2014. The Democrats’ top leader in the Senate, Sen. Chuck Schumer, is keeping his distance from the “Abolish ICE” campaign. He is instead using his Twitter account to tout Democrats’ promises on healthcare, guns, gay status, and claims that President Donald Trump is tied to Russian President Vladimir Putin. On the Abolish ICE campaign, Schumer is instead calling for a “czar” to focus media attention on “reunifying families.” That topic polls better for Democrats than ending immigration enforcement.
The president told Fox News that he believes his nominee will get some support from Democrats. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, an abortion rights supporter, is considered one of the key votes on a nominee. She said she wouldn't vote for someone who would overturn Roe v. Wade. "A candidate who would overturn Roe would not be acceptable," she said Sunday on ABC's This Week. Collins, who has previously bucked party lines on other key issues such as health care, said she plans to have an in-depth conversation with the nominee.
“I will not be a punching bag as part of anyone’s defense strategy,” he said emphatically. “I am not a villain of this story, and I will not allow others to try to depict me that way.”

The services sector, where most Americans are employed, has now expanded for 101 consecutive months, or more than eight years. The gain was better than many economists had been expecting and depicts an overall economy that appears to be regaining momentum after a slowdown in the winter.
The most-active Brent LCOc1 futures contract for September delivery settled up 48 cents at $78.24 per barrel.

But that no-deportations policy would allow many companies to hire illegals instead of Americans. That subsequent rush of migrants would force down wages for Americans and for legal immigrants, force up rents and housing prices, and also overcrowd public K-12 schools.

While not as eye-catching as, for example, his demand that his official vehicle use sirens so he could reach a French restaurant on time, Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left behind a demoralized agency where staff fret that their ability to protect public health has been diminished. A staunch ally of oil and gas companies, Pruitt stacked EPA advisory boards with industry representatives and sought to set aside whole troves of research that link pollution to various illnesses. He oversaw the delay or destruction of dozens of clean air and water rules, sparking legal battles with states and environmental groups. The EPA’s record in court under Pruitt was patchy but his deregulatory zeal was enough to impress Trump, who said Pruitt was doing a “fantastic job” even as scandals that sparked more than a dozen different investigations swirled around him. Pruitt became a trusted advisor to Trump, helping convince the president the US should withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.
China Mobile has reportedly been censoring content banned by the Chinese government’s “great firewall,” even when Chinese citizens are in the United States — prompting the FCC to debate its license. According to the Washington Post, on Monday, the U.S. Department of Commerce “recommended the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) deny a license to China Mobile, the state-run company that is the world’s largest phone network by subscribers.”
“The Commerce Department suggested the move because of the national security risk China Mobile poses,” they explained, adding that China Mobile is an “arm of the Chinese state,” and that “those with China Mobile as their carrier are often unable to access American websites and apps that are banned in China.”
One Chinese journalist was reportedly unable to access Facebook, the New York Times, and Google Maps from their phone while in the United States. Another user, Shanghai analyst May Sun, warned that the “Great Firewall” doesn’t stop when you enter the United States as a Chinese citizen. “[It] is exactly the same as when you surf on the Internet at home,” May Sun declared. “You still don’t have access to what is blocked by the Great Firewall.”
In a statement, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) called China Mobile an “unacceptable risk.”
“Granting the authorization poses an unacceptable risk to U.S. national security and law enforcement,” NTIA proclaimed.
So let’s be clear - you have no shared plans,no tourist business consultation and no agreement with the Scottish Gov. — Fiona Hyslop (@FionaHyslop) July 4, 2018 Report
On Wednesday, Mr McVey said the council had "engaged pretty consistently" with the government, adding: "Fiona Hyslop said any scheme would require engagement with the industry and that's exactly what we're doing. "We have taken a far more robust and professional approach and I've noticed a huge amount of openness to the idea in some quarters that were fairly dismissive of our previous attempts as a local authority." The Scottish Conservatives - who oppose having a tourist tax scheme - said the exchange was "an embarrassing split right at the top of the SNP", with Ms Hyslop "slapping down" Mr McVey "in full public view".
That will allow Trump to argue that his tough approach to trade is paying off. There are reasons why the US economy is currently strong, but none of them have anything to do with tariffs on imports. In part, it is the lagged effect of a buoyant global economy in 2017; in part it is explained by tax cuts and the stimulus still being provided by only gently rising interest rates. Mickey Levy, chief US economist for Berenberg, says Trump’s deregulation agenda has been a factor in boosting America’s underlying growth rate. Evidence from Barack Obama’s presidency shows how protectionist policies can backfire.
POLITICO Playbook: Michael Cohen speaks
NEW YORK, NY - MAY 30: Michael Cohen, (C) former personal lawyer and confidante for President Donald Trump, exits the United States District Court Southern District of New York on May 30, 2018 in New York City. According to a filing submitted to the court Tuesday night by special master Barbara Jones, federal prosecutors investigating Michael Cohen, a longtime personal lawyer and confidante for President Donald Trump, are set to receive 1 million files from three of his cellphones that were seized last month.

BREAKING ... ABC NEWS' GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS SPOKE TO MICHAEL COHEN: "Michael Cohen says family and country, not President Trump, is his 'first loyalty'": "When I asked Cohen directly what he would do if prosecutors forced him to choose between protecting the president and protecting his family, he said his family is 'my first priority.' "Cohen added: 'Once I understand what charges might be filed against me, if any at all, I will defer to my new counsel, Guy Petrillo, for guidance.' Story Continued Below
"But when I pointed out to Cohen that he wasn’t repeating past vows to 'take a bullet' and 'do anything' to protect the president, the longtime Trump loyalist left little doubt about where he stands now, saying simply: 'To be crystal clear, my wife, my daughter and my son, and this country have my first loyalty.'
In addition, five women experienced excessive pain and two had excessive bleeding. Cindy Farquhar, postgraduate professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Auckland and senior author of the research, told the Guardian clinics should stop offering women endometrial scratches. “I think it is unreasonable for clinics to ask for patients to pay for something when there is now clear evidence that there is no added benefit,” she said. “I would hope that it will disappear from the list of add-ons that many clinics have both in the UK and in New Zealand and Australia.”
Stuart Lavery, a consultant gynaecologist at Hammersmith Hospital who was not involved in the study, said women who have recurrent implantation failure are hard to treat. “This mini-trauma offered a real potentially exciting way forward and it has become very widely adopted in international practice and in UK practice,” he said.
The University of Missouri is still facing enrollment and budgetary problems, including a $49 million budget shortfall, as a result of the 2015 social justice protests that caught national media attention. Many people remember the high-pitched yell of former University of Missouri professor Melissa Click. Click found herself at the center of weeks of unrest at the University of Missouri in 2015 and 2016. Click rose to infamy after a video of her calling for a student photojournalist to be physically removed from campus simply because he was documenting the protests. The protests involved accusations by students that the administration had mishandled several alleged racial issues on campus.
Cult activities escalated after the defeat of Aum members in the 1990 parliamentary election. During their bizarre election campaign, Asahara and his top disciples sang and danced to the guru's songs. In June 1994, the cult spread sarin gas in Matsumoto in central Japan, killing eight people and injuring more than 140 others, in an attack targeting residents who were protesting the cult's presence in their neighborhood and court officials handling their legal disputes. Nakagawa and key members produced sarin at a cult compound and sprayed it from a van, in what was later regarded as an experiment for the subsequent subway gassing. Under intensifying scrutiny from the government, the cult plotted the larger sarin attack on the subways in Tokyo on March 20, 1995.
What has the government said? Mr Javid called on Russia to explain "exactly what has gone on", adding: "We will stand up to the actions that threaten our security." The home secretary said he was "comfortable" the "exact same nerve agent" had been used in both the Salisbury and Amesbury poisonings - but added it was not yet known if they were from the same batch. In response to Mr Javid's comments, Russia said the British government was subjecting them "to hell". Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova urged police not to be led by the "dirty political game" and said she was confident London would have to apologise to Russia.

In one case, Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion that illegal immigrants do not have the same bargaining rights as American citizens and legal workers. “… an illegal immigrant worker is not an ’employee’ under the NLRA for the simple reason that, ever since 1986, an illegal immigrant worker is not a lawful ’employee’ in the United States,” Kavanaugh wrote. In another case, Kavanaugh noted that American multi-national corporations do not have the right to import foreign workers. The Circuit judge explained, “Under the provision of the immigration laws at issue here, mere economic expediency does not authorize an employer to displace American workers for foreign workers.”
Prominent conservative Ann Coulter has also called for Trump to nominate Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, arguing that other judges such as Thomas Hardiman and Raymond Kethledge “are open borders zealots.”

"The cost that implies is just not realistic." Trump's singular focus on reviving manufacturing is, in some ways, at a right angle to the true nature of the U.S. economy. Service industries employ more than 10 times as many Americans -- about 125 million -- as manufacturing does, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The figure includes about 19 million jobs in healthcare and social assistance, almost 16 million in leisure and hospitality and 16 million in retail. Services include most of America's corporate stars, from Alphabet Inc. to Goldman Sachs, and are unquestionably globally competitive: the country exported about $255 billion more in services than it imported last year.

Began his career in environmental law at the EPA, as a special assistant in the agency's toxics office during President George H.W. Spent years playing various roles on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, which oversees the EPA, drafting regulations on chemical safety, air and water pollution and climate change — generally seeking to reduce government regulations on industries that generate greenhouse gases. Served as longtime aide to Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., whom you may recall from the 2015 floor speech in which he rebutted climate change science with a snowball. After leaving Congress, worked for years as a lobbyist for some of the largest coal, chemical and uranium companies in the U.S. — including the uranium mining firm that pushed for the reduction of Bears Ears National Monument, which is near one of its processing facilities.

The list of Democrats expressing frustration with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has been growing longer in recent weeks, but don’t expect to see former President Barack Obama’s name on it. At a party fundraising event Friday afternoon in Northern California, Obama spoke highly of Pelosi – and even predicted that she will return to the job of House speaker after November’s midterm elections. “I think everybody knows how much I love Nancy Pelosi,” Obama told the gathering at a home in affluent Atherton, Politico reported.

Sharif's overthrow by then army chief Pervez Musharraf showed how dangerous it was for any politician to attempt to curtail the military's influence in Pakistan with its history of coups. Sharif was arrested, jailed and eventually sentenced to life imprisonment on charges of hijacking and terrorism. He was also convicted of corruption and banned for life from political activities.

On this much police and activist South Side priest Michael Pfleger can agree: Saturday morning’s anti-violence march on the Dan Ryan Expressway is all about danger. Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.
That came on the heels of 0.9 percent drop in March, the first monthly drop since July of 2017. Total private construction rose 0.3 percent, with residential projects up 0.8 percent in May. New single-family home construction rose 0.6 percent and the volatile apartment building sector jumped 1.6 percent. Private, non-residential building fell 0.3 percent. Economists are forecasting that construction spending will contribute to overall growth this year even though interest rates are rising.
And that was the case pertaining to public unions. So would you describe the case for us? So about 20 states have laws that say if you're a government worker and you want to work for the government, you're going to be represented by a public union. And you don't have to pay for their political activities, but you do have to pay fees for their collective bargaining on your behalf.
Straight-A students are being turned away from British medical schools and forced to pay for training in Eastern Europe, while the National Health Service (NHS) plunders the Third World for already-trained doctors instead. The Daily Mail spoke to a number of star students who earned top A-levels and supplemented their CVs with spells volunteering at local GP surgeries, overseas clinics, hospices, and pharmacies — and even earned degrees in related fields such as Biomedical Science — who were turned away from British medical schools, despite the NHS facing a shortfall of some 10,000 doctors. Department of Health and Social Care figures show that only 6,000 of 18,000 medical school applicants were awarded places last year — with many of the 6,000 likely going to foreign applicants, who have often been favoured over British applicants. In fact, the Mail found that so many talented would-be medical students were being rejected that a cottage industry of English-language medical schools in countries such as Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Armenia, and Georgia have sprung up to cater to them — but even this option is not available to youngsters who cannot afford the fees.

Nearly 600 more retail jobs are to go in the UK as the Jacques Vert, Windsmoor and Precis department store brands are wound down by administrators. Administrators said they had failed to find a buyer for Calvetron Brands, which had been restructured following a rescue deal last summer. The business entered administration in May and had already shed more than 400 jobs before Wednesday’s announcement. The latest retail job losses come as more than 30,000 jobs are at risk in the UK following mass closure announcements by major chains including House of Fraser, New Look and Marks & Spencer. Retailers are suffering from rising costs and the switch to online shopping just as hard-pressed consumers rein in spending.

Watts was transported to a nearby hospital, where 85 to 90 percent of his body was found to have been burned, Georgia State Patrol told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Authorities said Watts, upset with the federal agency designated to aid veterans, attached a homemade incendiary device and fireworks to his body before pouring liquid on himself. He then ignited the fluid. VETERAN PROTESTING TREATMENT BY VA SETS HIMSELF ON FIRE NEAR GEORGIA STATE CAPITOL, POLICE SAY
"It looks like a veteran that was disgruntled with the VA did a personal protest in front of the Capitol which involved gasoline and some fireworks,” Commissioner Mark McDonough, of the Georgia Department of Public Safety, said. The commissioner added a Capitol trooper "actually put him out with his fire extinguisher."
Despite the ban, police allowed the organizers to read a press statement. “We do not recognize this ban,” the group said in the statement read out loud by a volunteer, calling the prohibition imposed by Istanbul’s governor “comical.”
Police told the crowd to disperse after the statement, warning “otherwise, we will intervene.” Officers patrolled with dogs and had water cannons stationed nearby. They fired tear gas on groups in some areas and were seen elsewhere pushing and shouting at participants who were too slow to scatter. March organizers said Friday that the governor had prohibited the march in violation of the right to freedom of assembly. The governor has cited security reasons and public “sensitivities” as grounds for barring LGBTI marches since 2015.
He said he supports the project and wants to see it succeed “more than anybody.”

Corporate America couldn’t hire Republican lobbyists fast enough after President Donald Trump’s election gave the GOP unified control of Washington. Now there are signs that Democrats are back in demand. Companies and trade groups are trying to hire congressional staffers with ties to influential House Democrats four months ahead of the midterm elections, in which Democrats are expected to pick up seats and potentially retake control of the House. Lobbyists are helping their clients meet with the Democrats who would become committee chairs if the party does win back the chamber. And trade groups are talking to members about what to expect from a Democratic takeover.

In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners.

It’s shocking that Mr. James is surprised by the positive economic results of less regulation and lower taxes.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
In one case, Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion that illegal immigrants do not have the same bargaining rights as American citizens and legal workers. “… an illegal immigrant worker is not an ’employee’ under the NLRA for the simple reason that, ever since 1986, an illegal immigrant worker is not a lawful ’employee’ in the United States,” Kavanaugh wrote. In another case, Kavanaugh noted that American multi-national corporations do not have the right to import foreign workers. The Circuit judge explained, “Under the provision of the immigration laws at issue here, mere economic expediency does not authorize an employer to displace American workers for foreign workers.”
Prominent conservative Ann Coulter has also called for Trump to nominate Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, arguing that other judges such as Thomas Hardiman and Raymond Kethledge “are open borders zealots.”

As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections.

"Peace and tranquility are the fruits of justice," Lopez Obrador said. Exit polling by Consulta Mitofsky for the Televisa network forecast gubernatorial wins for allies of Lopez Obrador's Morena party in at least four of eight state races on the ballot plus for the head of government in Mexico City. The central state of Guanajuato was expected to go to a candidate of the conservative National Action Party. Mitofsky predicted Morena allies would take between 56 and 70 seats in the 128-member Senate and between 256 and 291 spots in the 500-seat lower house. "The anger that the average Mexican feels toward the way things are being governed has favored Lopez Obrador," said Shannon O'Neil, senior fellow for Latin America Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.
Multiple proposed travel bans were stayed by federal courts. Congress has passed various immigration laws; some have been interpreted to allow the executive to restrict immigration the way Trump has, while other interpretations suggest that he cannot. The courts will rule on the question, and the Trump administration will almost certainly honor that ruling, as it has every other court ruling. That does not mean Trump will be nice about it; it does not mean the absence of absurd, scurrilous and misleading tweets. It simply means that the legal process will be obeyed.
“They’ve twisted American values,” she said in a follow-up phone interview. “A lot of them are anti-God, anti-religion and anti-military.”
In the survey, most say they are proud to be Americans, although Republicans feel that way more strongly (90 percent) than Democrats (61 percent). There is no consensus when asked about the country’s current course, though: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. “Overwhelming majorities of those in both parties and independents agree that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.”” USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll

Even Pruitt’s own staff had begun to sour on him, with many worrying that their future career prospects would be damaged by their association with Pruitt’s tenure. Each scandal seemed more damning than the last. Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.
Here's a quick review: Wheeler ...
Began his career in environmental law at the EPA, as a special assistant in the agency's toxics office during President George H.W. Spent years playing various roles on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, which oversees the EPA, drafting regulations on chemical safety, air and water pollution and climate change — generally seeking to reduce government regulations on industries that generate greenhouse gases. Served as longtime aide to Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., whom you may recall from the 2015 floor speech in which he rebutted climate change science with a snowball. After leaving Congress, worked for years as a lobbyist for some of the largest coal, chemical and uranium companies in the U.S. — including the uranium mining firm that pushed for the reduction of Bears Ears National Monument, which is near one of its processing facilities.
Among those reported to be among the top of President Donald Trump’s short list is Judge Brett Kavanaugh on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The prospect of a Justice Kavanaugh worries some consumer advocates, who say he has taken an activist position against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the regulator implemented in the wake of the Great Recession in the hopes of thwarting future financial meltdowns. “Kavanaugh’s track record has shown tremendous sympathy to political rhetoric, more so than to established precedent as it relates to the Bureau,” said Aaron Klein, director of the Center on Regulation and Markets at the Brookings Institution. “His ruling was closer to congressional talking points than legal precedent.”
Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center, said that the center doesn’t weigh in on potential judicial appointees, but that open hostility to the agency’s mission would be cause for concern. “Obviously, it would be concerning if there was a justice that was inclined to invalidate the CFPB,” she said.

But even those sympathetic to the biggest retailer in the US are questioning whether there has been more take than give. Amazon has long been accused of stretching the city’s transit and education systems, and its highly paid workers have driven up prices of goods and housing. The resentful murmur recently became a roar after Amazon reacted to the city’s latest tax proposal, which would have charged large businesses an annual $275 per employee, by resorting to what critics call blackmail.

Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.

KTVA: “Saturday afternoon, Alan and Shandy Cuellar held their fairytale wedding at the Bayshore Clubhouse in south Anchorage in front of nearly 100 of their family and friends -- and a curious moose. Just days before the wedding, Shandy went to the venue to meet with her wedding coordinator to go over the setup. As they were looking around, they noticed a moose at the pond and they both said how amazing it would be if that was the backdrop to their wedding photos. Sure enough, just before the couple’s first kiss as husband and wife, they heard something behind them.
The first table shows that over the last decade there has been a clear correlation between the primary vote of governments and their leader. But conversely, the second table shows virtually no correlation between the fortunes of oppositions and their leaders. The implication is clear, people only really pass judgment on leaders when they are actually leading; the mythology of Kevin 07 aside, governments are removed when they cease to deliver for the Australian people. Think about it and it makes sense. Labor won in 2007 because John Howard had overreached on industrial relations and generally outlived his welcome.
EU-US trade in goods and services is worth more than €1 trillion euros ($1.2 trillion) each year. The European Union said earlier this week that America's trading partners could retaliate against nearly $300 billion of US exports if the Trump administration decides to penalize automobile imports from around the world. Related: EU warns Trump's car tariffs threaten $300 billion of US exports
In May, the US government launched an investigation into imports of automobiles, including SUVs, light trucks and auto parts. The type of investigation, known as Section 232, is meant to determine whether the imports are hurting US national security. It's the same approach the Trump administration used before it slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum imports earlier this year.
Delivering a speech in Newcastle on Thursday, he said: “At the moment, protectionism is largely just talk (and tweets). But what if rhetoric becomes reality?”
Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.
Teddy Roosevelt hopped on whistle stop tour after whistle stop tour where he was able to drop into rural and suburban communities alike to deliver short, pre-packaged speeches that local papers would usually print verbatim. (He left them short on purpose for that very reason.) Franklin Roosevelt revolutionized and heightened the stature of the office with his fireside chats, that brought his message over the heads of the pesky press corps and directly into the living rooms of the American people. But, though it would have been seen as a scoop, even the reporters covering Lyndon B. Johnson had the good sense not to report on every turd he dropped in their presence. While the founders envisioned a government that moved slowly and methodically, today’s Wi-Fi-enabled political discourse is demanding the opposite.
The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.
Over the fireplace at Mingo Creek Craft Distillers, a whiskey purveyor in the small town of Washington, Pennsylvania, a portrait of Alexander Hamilton hangs upside down. With snowy hair and a black velvet jacket, Hamilton wears an impassive look that might be described as hauteur. In 1791, to pay off debts the newly formed United States incurred during the revolutionary war, Hamilton imposed the first federal tax on the people of the region. By taxing their most lucrative product, whiskey, he became what he is here today: a villain representing the excesses of the federal government. The town of Washington is only a six-hour drive from Manhattan, but it’s a world away from the Broadway stage where Hamilton, clad in snug white knickers, enjoys a better reputation.

"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.

Yet those people were served. And since it is in Virginia, was Sanders even the first member of the Trump administration to eat there? Maybe others less recognizable had already come and gone. As for “compassion,” what compassion are you showing for someone who, for all you know, may struggle with certain elements of her job herself? What compassion are you showing in a country where the Supreme Court just ruled on gay customers being denied services in a cake shop, yet your gay staff members want you to refuse service to someone they don’t like?
Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.
Once the Supreme Court nominee is confirmed by the Senate, the president must issue a written commission to his nominee. Afterward, the nominee needs to be sworn in – taking two oaths of office – before assuming his official position on the nation's highest court. Fox News’ Judson Berger, John Roberts and The Associated Press have contributed to this report.

Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.
In what ways should these concerns shape congressional expectations about transparency of the nominee vetting process and the standards for recusal in cases involving President Trump’s legal affairs? Consider first the not-unlikely prospect of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who has developed a robust view of presidential immunity from legal process fully consistent with some of the more aggressive positions of the president and his legal team. Kavanaugh has written that:
Congress might consider a law exempting a President—while in office—from criminal prosecution and investigation, including from questioning by criminal prosecutors or defense counsel. Criminal investigations targeted at or revolving around a President are inevitably politicized by both their supporters and critics. As I have written before, “no Attorney General or special counsel will have the necessary credibility to avoid the inevitable charges that he is politically motivated—whether in favor of the President or against him, depending on the individual leading the investigation and its results.” The indictment and trial of a sitting President, moreover, would cripple the federal government, rendering it unable to function with credibility in either the international or domestic arenas.
“He beat all 15 of those candidates that he faced (crushed many).”
To those that claim that only a traditional politician with "experience" can beat Trump, go back & look at the results from 2016. He beat all 15 of those candidates that he faced (crushed many). If we go down the same path and are not smart, don't be surprised with the result. — Michael Avenatti (@MichaelAvenatti) July 4, 2018
On “Real Time With Bill Maher” in late April, Avenatti dodged a question from the host about a future in politics, saying he was focused on another “small matter.” Avenatti is representing Daniels in her legal fight against Trump and his former attorney Michael Cohen.
"A candidate who would overturn Roe would not be acceptable," she said Sunday on ABC's This Week. Collins, who has previously bucked party lines on other key issues such as health care, said she plans to have an in-depth conversation with the nominee. She emphasized that there were certain people on Trump's candidate list that she wouldn't vote for, though she didn't specify who those people were. She said she believed it would be inappropriate to ask a nominee how they would vote on a future case. But she emphasized that they had to talk about precedent.
“That was the last photo we took of her,” she says. Over the years, she has met with three American presidents to ask for help. In November, she met with Melania and Donald Trump in Tokyo.

Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) trashed the June jobs report — even though it showed rapid job growth, rising wages, and low unemployment. The report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that employers created 213,000 new jobs in June — 22,000 more than economists had expected. Manufacturing jobs in particular rose by 36,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.
I maintained an infrequent presence in local gyms, even though none of the muscle I packed on put a dent in my self-hatred.

“I think he’s gonna try and help us with border,” Trump told the reporters. He described “unbelievably bad border laws, immigration laws” in the United States, calling them “the weakest in the world, laughed at by everybody in the world.” He contrasted the U.S. immigration laws with “Mexico’s very strong immigration laws.”
Trump suggested that Mexico can help the United States “until we straighten out our immigration laws, which have been bad for many, many years, decades.” He further assured, “We’re gonna have them taken care of.”

Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.

Their kids have just been kidnapped. How do you prepare for your [asylum case?] Carlos García, immigration lawyer,
On top of his private practice, García plans to visit Port Isabel a few times a week, which is an hour and a half drive from his office, to give migrants legal advice. He recently committed to fully representing a mother who has not spoken to her six-year-old child in three weeks. García says he’s tempted to take on more cases every time he visits the detention center, and he receives a few emails every day from other lawyers about someone else in need of an attorney.
Part of its mission is to provide local veterans with a monthly ration of what he calls medical-grade cannabis free of charge. It started back in 2011.

The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year. The prison population has soared by 20% since the 2015 report. Almost half of all prisoners released reoffend and return to prison within two years. “As the government tightens sentencing and bail conditions, and builds more prisons, there is no indication that these trends are likely to change,” Glass said.
Ethiopia's government has fired five prison officials as it confronts allegations of torture and other abuses of inmates as part of a wave of reforms. Among those fired is the federal prison chief who until recently defended the treatment of inmates as "fair." The firings came ahead of a new Human Rights Watch report released Thursday that documents widespread arbitrary detention, torture, rape and humiliation over several years in Ethiopia's eastern Somali region. It urges new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to investigate the "horrific" situation. Abiy has admitted that security forces have tortured people but has yet to "tackle Ethiopia's culture of impunity and ensure accountability," said Felix Horne, senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Those factories are the core of an American operation that employs about 136,000 people, but they're also dependent on components sourced overseas for reasons of cost or availability. About 70 percent of the parts in a U.S.-built Camry, the country's best-selling car, come from domestic suppliers. Toyota on June 27 said that Trump's threatened 25 percent tariff on automotive imports would add $1,800 to the price of each sedan. The carmaker's warning of the dangers of tit-for-tat tariffs was just one of many. German lighting manufacturer Osram Licht's shares plunged 22 percent Thursday after it announced a weaker outlook due to trade tensions.
It's difficult to imagine Old Hickory, as he was known, excusing himself from military duty on the grounds that he could not march long distances, as Mr Trump did during the Vietnam War, citing bone spurs. The parallels between the 45th president and the 13th - unlucky for some - are arguably more compelling. Fillmore launched his career in the 1820s with the Anti-Masonic Party, hawking a paranoid rumour that ruling Freemasons were murdering whistleblowers. Mr Trump paved the way for his White House bid by peddling a conspiracy theory, too - that President Barack Obama was not a US citizen.

Fillmore later joined the Whig Party at a time of mounting hostility to refugees from famine, rebellion and tyranny who were arriving by the shipload at the gates of the New World.

These numbers are similar to those from a February Quinnipiac poll, where 49 percent of voters said Trump was racist and 46 percent said he was not. Forty-four percent of voters said they think “racist beliefs” were a motive in Trump’s immigration policy, while 50 percent said Trump has “a sincere interest in controlling our borders.” Sixty percent said the policy of separating children from their parents at the border was a violation of human rights. Since enacting the policy, Trump and his associates have repeatedly pushed false, racist narratives to garner support, often associating immigration with high crime rates despite no evidence to support claims that immigrants commit more crime than U.S. citizens. While only 11 percent of Republican voters in the Quinnipiac poll said they think Trump is a racist, 22 percent said they believe Trump has emboldened racist people to express their beliefs publicly. The number of hate crimes rose the year Trump was elected ― the first increase in over a decade.

Referendum to remove ‘outdated’ clause encouraging mothers to choose domestic duties over paid employment to be held by November
Ireland to vote over constitution clause on women's role in the home
Ireland will hold a referendum to remove a clause in the constitution marking the importance of a woman’s “life within the home” and encouraging mothers to shun paid employment to fulfil domestic duties, the government has announced. The move unveiled on Thursday is the latest to update Ireland’s socially conservative 1937 constitution to reflect a more secular and socially liberal population. Ireland was long one of Europe’s most socially conservative countries, but opinions have changed rapidly in recent decades as the power of the Roman Catholic church has waned. A 2015 referendum introduced gay marriage into the constitution and a vote earlier this year allowed access to abortion. The constitution, which includes a number of references to the country’s traditional Christian ethos, currently contains a clause that “recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the state a support without which the common good cannot be achieved”.
President Trump had suggested lifting the prohibition, which environmentalists charge would raise levels of ground ozone during warmer months, during his campaign for the White House. Following the news of Mr. Pruitt’s resignation, Mr. Dinneen wrote that there was a “collective sigh of relief coming from the Midwest,” calling the 2019 ethanol quotas “the straw that broke the camel’s back.”
While it is too early to say how the handling of waivers or the treatment of E15 may change under new leadership, one indicator was small losses in affected refiners in early Friday trading and gains in most ethanol producers. CVR Refining, Andeavor and Delek U.S. Holdings , all of which benefited from waivers granted by the EPA, had rallied by 136%, 40% and 92% in the year ended Thursday, respectively. Ethanol companies Pacific Ethanol and Green Plains had fallen by 60% and 14%, respectively. Agricultural lobbyists often portray any easing of the rules as a sop to “big oil,” but that isn’t accurate.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

Analysts say tariffs are not the most effective way of putting pressure on China, which the US accuses of unfair trade practices and stealing intellectual property from US companies. Syracuse University economics professor Mary Lovely and researcher Yang Liang found 87% of electronics products to be levied by US tariffs came from multinationals and joint ventures rather than Chinese firms. China’s economy is no longer as dependent on exports. Domestic consumption now accounts for more than half of the country’s GDP. Exports to the US account for only 19% of all of China’s exports.

Economists have warned the import tariffs could disrupt the supply chain, undermine business investment and raise prices for consumers, and wipe out the stimulus from a $1.5 trillion tax cut package that came into effect in January. “As with the manufacturing report released on Tuesday, there was plenty of anecdotal evidence that tariffs were beginning to have an impact, but with the prices balance falling in June and new export orders rising, there is little sign that this is affecting the economy yet,” said Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York.

Services industries also complained about difficulties finding qualified workers, especially truck drivers, which some said was “getting worse each month.” There are a record 6.7 million unfilled jobs.

Some industries said they “need to hire more people,” and others noted that “employee retention is getting much more competitive.”

Sen. Susan Collins speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, June 21. | AP Photo Collins: New justice should not favor overturning Roe v. Wade
Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Sunday that President Donald Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court should not seek to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that enshrined abortion rights in the United States. “Roe v. Wade is a constitutional right that is well-established,” Collins said on “State of the Union” on CNN. “And no less an authority than Chief Justice [John] Roberts said that repeatedly at his confirmation hearing.“
Story Continued Below
Trump last week said he wouldn’t ask potential Supreme Court nominees about abortion rights — a departure from his stance on the campaign trail, when he said he would only nominate justices to the Supreme Court who oppose abortion. “I think what he said as the candidate may not have been informed by the legal advice that he now has,” Collins told Jake Tapper.
Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left a demoralized agency where staff fear their ability to protect public health is diminished
Scott Pruitt is out but his impact on the environment will be felt for years
Scott Pruitt, who has finally stepped down as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency after a long-rumbling corruption scandal, rose to public prominence on the back of a series of increasingly outlandish ethical controversies. Scott Pruitt resigns: Trump's scandal-ridden EPA chief steps down Read more
From lobbying fast food company Chick-fil-A on behalf of his wife, to demanding his staff acquire a mattress from a Trump Hotel – not to mention the millions of taxpayer dollars spent on security, first-class travel and soundproof booths – Pruitt’s behavior clashed spectacularly with any pretense of Trump’s pledge to “drain the swamp” in Washington. But the lasting legacy of the former Oklahoma attorney general – who was picked by Trump after crusading against what he called the EPA’s “activist agenda” – is likely to be felt in the systematic weakening of environmental regulations. While not as eye-catching as, for example, his demand that his official vehicle use sirens so he could reach a French restaurant on time, Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left behind a demoralized agency where staff fret that their ability to protect public health has been diminished. A staunch ally of oil and gas companies, Pruitt stacked EPA advisory boards with industry representatives and sought to set aside whole troves of research that link pollution to various illnesses.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.

The first, Antonio Halili, was the mayor of the much larger Tanauan City, south of Manila. Unlike Bote, Halili had developed both a reputation for having a heavy hand against drug traffickers and negotiating with them. Halili appeared on a more recent Duterte list of elected officials with ties to drug trafficking in 2017. Shortly after Halili’s assassination, Duterte told reporters, “I don’t know who killed him, but I told you don’t [engage in illegal drugs]. … His procession of drug suspects was just a front.”
Prior to this accusation, however, Halili had established a “walk of shame” program where he paraded drug suspects around his city for the public to jeer, leading others in the government to suggest he was killed by drug traffickers in revenge for humiliating their peers.

Here's a quick review: Wheeler ...
Began his career in environmental law at the EPA, as a special assistant in the agency's toxics office during President George H.W. Spent years playing various roles on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, which oversees the EPA, drafting regulations on chemical safety, air and water pollution and climate change — generally seeking to reduce government regulations on industries that generate greenhouse gases. Served as longtime aide to Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., whom you may recall from the 2015 floor speech in which he rebutted climate change science with a snowball. After leaving Congress, worked for years as a lobbyist for some of the largest coal, chemical and uranium companies in the U.S. — including the uranium mining firm that pushed for the reduction of Bears Ears National Monument, which is near one of its processing facilities.
He took a short position in shipping company Navigator Holdings worth between $100,001 and $250,000 on Oct. 31, five days after the New York Times contacted him about an article linking Navigator indirectly to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ross told CNBC earlier this week that he also shorted shares in Air Lease and Ocwen Financial. Ross, who plays a key role in increasingly high-stakes trade talks, says those sales were part of divestments made to work in government and he didn’t profit from those transactions. Democratic lawmakers are increasingly concerned, though. Last week, three members of Congress asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate whether Ross violated insider-trading laws.

A major North Sea wind power development off Aberdeen which was opposed by Donald Trump has generated its first power. A total of 11 turbines make up the European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre (EOWDC). Power from the wind farm, developed by Swedish energy group Vattenfall, is being exported to the National Grid. Mr Trump battled unsuccessfully in the courts to halt the project before he became US president. He said they would spoil the view from his Aberdeenshire golf course at Menie.
LONDON (Reuters) - The United States and Saudi Arabia appear to have reached an understanding: Washington will reduce or eliminate Iran’s oil export revenues and in return Riyadh will guarantee oil supplies and stabilize prices.

The basic deal is well understood by policymakers in both countries, with U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly emphasizing his great personal relationship with the Saudi king and crown prince. But strong personal relationships between the leaders and agreement on the overall deal obscure disagreement on some key details, not least the desirable level for oil prices.
“That was a very sad day for the country when that vote was cast,” Trump said in June. But Republican lawmakers dispute arguments suggesting their efforts to undo ObamaCare have been totally fruitless. “We eliminated the individual mandate that said that people had to buy government-approved insurance,” said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo. “In a sense, it blew a big hole in ObamaCare.”
There’s a potential electoral landmine ahead for Republicans hoping to keep their majorities in the House and Senate, though: premium increases. “We’re going to get another round right before the election, which is something the GOP is nervous about,” said John C. Goodman, president of the Goodman Institute.
Trump has since ordered the separations be stopped, but it hasn't curbed calls on the left to "abolish ICE." Hundreds of thousands of marchers participated in more than 700 marches across the country over the weekend to protest the family separations. They gathered on the front lawn of a Border Patrol station in McAllen, Texas, near a detention center where migrant children were being held in cages, and on a street corner near Trump's golf resort at Bedminster, New Jersey, where the president was spending the weekend. Tweeting Saturday from New Jersey, Trump urged ICE agents to "not worry or lose your spirit" and wrote that "the radical left Dems want you out. Next it will be all police."

Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
Tesla could use a lighter moment. It has had a 2018 filled with ups and downs. In May, Consumer Reports initially did not recommend the electric vehicle giant’s Model 3, its first car priced for mainstream buyers, in part because of long stopping distances, only to see the magazine relent after it flashed software to cars that improved them. Last month, Tesla topped a list of best-selling electric vehicles in the United States, selling three of the five most popular cars. And this week, Tesla announced that it had reached Musk's goal of manufacturing 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week.

An interactive online HIV prevention program has reduced the sexually transmitted infection rates of gonorrhea and chlamydia by 40 percent among young gay and bisexual men, the first such approach to show an impact on sexual health, a new study found. The program, “Keep It Up!,” challenges traditional sexual education models and seeks to “keep up” HIV negative test results and educate racially and ethnically diverse at-risk gay and bisexual youth through soap operas, interactive games and real-world simulations. The program targets men 18 to 29 who have sex with men, a group that is disproportionately affected by HIV infections in the U.S. While this group represents only 2 percent of all young people, it accounts for 70 percent of HIV diagnoses according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Keep It Up!” is made up of different modules involving interactive games, exercises, a simulation at a bar and a soap opera.
The liberal high school teacher ousted a 24-year incumbent who served as House majority leader in 2016. Now, the state party has endorsed a professor at a Catholic University who signed a letter supporting Ireland's abortion ban, which was recently overturned. "Quite frankly, they are not used to women of color, black women, standing up," Ranglin-Vassell said. Democratic state Rep. Teresa Tanzi, standing, talks with Democratic Rep. Marcia Ranglin-Vassell during the legislative session In Providence, Rhode Island, on Jan. 9, 2018.

Mia Ackerman, foreground.
According to new reports, the University of Missouri is currently facing a $49 million budget shortfall. Additionally, the university has laid off 30 employees and eliminated 155 vacant positions. Missouri State Senator Tom Hurst directly attributes the university’s budgetary and enrollment issues to the 2015 protests. “Couple of years ago, whenever all the protests were taking place on the campus, many students decided they did not want that atmosphere and attended different universities, Hurst said. “From what I’ve seen we did not lose those students to other states, they just went to other universities within the state.”
“Given that it seems like MU does not need the funding, but some of the other universities in the State could use a little extra help because they did the right thing,” Hurst finished.
“They’ve twisted American values,” she said in a follow-up phone interview. “A lot of them are anti-God, anti-religion and anti-military.”
In the survey, most say they are proud to be Americans, although Republicans feel that way more strongly (90 percent) than Democrats (61 percent). There is no consensus when asked about the country’s current course, though: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. “Overwhelming majorities of those in both parties and independents agree that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.”” USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll
The USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll of 1,004 adults, taken online June 26-27, has a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The survey is one of a year-long series on American values.
"For a good few years we did see a decrease in the number of young people reportedly taking substances. "But over the last 12 to 18 months we have seen a slight increase."
Corporate America couldn’t hire Republican lobbyists fast enough after President Donald Trump’s election gave the GOP unified control of Washington. Now there are signs that Democrats are back in demand. Companies and trade groups are trying to hire congressional staffers with ties to influential House Democrats four months ahead of the midterm elections, in which Democrats are expected to pick up seats and potentially retake control of the House. Lobbyists are helping their clients meet with the Democrats who would become committee chairs if the party does win back the chamber. And trade groups are talking to members about what to expect from a Democratic takeover.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) spent a total of $4 billion on improper food stamp payments to those receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the USDA confirmed with Breitbart News on Friday. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service announced this week that improper payments made up 6.3 percent of SNAP money in the fiscal year (FY) 2017—the latest data available from the agency. Breitbart News analyzed the USDA’s data on food stamp spending and found that $4,007,026,532 of the $63,603,595,754 the agency spent on SNAP in FY 2017 went to improper payments. The USDA told Breitbart News that “it is important to note that improper payments include both overpayments and underpayments,” meaning that households on SNAP that received less than what they were supposed to receive for the month are also included in the percentage rate. Brandon Lipps, the Acting Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services at the agency, said that most improper payments are due to “human errors”—either because of state agencies miscalculating benefits or benefit recipients giving state agencies the wrong information.

That doesn’t require a smartphone in every hand. Many schools are already doing this as they see the benefits and have simply created their own policy that delivers the same effect. I think heads can be persuaded that such policies would fit and benefit all schools. Carolyn Roberts

It was no surprise to read that the very first lesson you suggest could be learned from overseas (Five things the NHS could do to improve service, 3 July) is the establishment of integrated health and social care, as has happened in New Zealand. The achievements of the Attlee government are at the heart of my socialist beliefs but the compromises which led then to the split between free NHS care and means-tested social care remain the achilles heel as the NHS celebrates 70 years. It is utterly ludicrous to have separate systems which imply distinct and neat boundaries between health and care, with rather a lot of people making a good living arguing on which side of the fence some poor demented soul belongs. Disputes around the funding of continuing care have become a major industry. The recent NHS funding announcement, making no reference whatsoever to social care, evidenced the fact that the government still hasn’t the least idea of how the two are umbilically linked.

ZURICH, July 2 (Reuters) - Swiss asset manager GAM Holding told employees it was preparing for a “worst case” Brexit scenario in which Britain gives up full access to the single market and customs union with the European Union, the Financial Times reported on Monday, citing an internal company email. “We are basing our contingency planning on the worst case,” the email said. Zurich-headquartered GAM later told the Financial Times it was “well placed to respond to any potential outcome of Brexit negotiations” with its operations across the EU, including most of its funds which are based in Ireland or Luxembourg, in response to questions about the email.

However, I will say this is all very reminiscent of a lot of conversations we heard in 2008 about the old versus the new guard. I think, look, where are Democrats on the major policies? You know, minimum wage increase. Majority of Americans are there, right? Cortez ran on people over the money.
