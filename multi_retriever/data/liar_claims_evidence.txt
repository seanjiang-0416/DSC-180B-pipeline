Says the Annies List political group supports third-trimester abortions on demand.	BREAKING: @NEAToday President @Lily_NEA reacts to radical ruling by #SCOTUS: "We are living in a system that is rigged to benefit special interests & billionaires, all at the expense of working people." FULL STATEMENT: https://t.co/uE4j5lQPGh #Janus #JanusvAFSCME #Union — NEA Public Relations (@NEAMedia) June 27, 2018
A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.
When did the decline of coal start? It started when natural gas took off that started to begin in (President George W.) Bushs administration.	California's utilities are “public monopolies” that are given a legislated profit. They are allowed to be monopolies in return for benefiting the public. San Diego Gas and Electric wants ratepayers to pay for its negligence in regards to wildfires. Southern California Edison wants to pass along the costs of its mismanagement at the San Onofre nuclear plant. Pacific Gas and Electric wants ratepayers to cover the cost of a settlement for its 2010 pipeline explosion.
"Hillary Clinton agrees with John McCain ""by voting to give George Bush the benefit of the doubt on Iran."""	Even though he received what he called a “shellacking” in the 2010 midterms, and even though the GOP made unprecedented political gains during his tenure, President Obama was always convinced the country was behind him. As Mara Liasson wrote for NPR in 2016: “During Obama's eight years in office, the Democrats have lost more House, Senate, state legislative and governors seats than under any other president.” She noted that the Obama legacy includes “one huge failure: a diminished Democratic Party.”
In 2013, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., invoked the so-called “nuclear option,” discarding traditional filibuster protections for the minority party in favor of requiring only a simple majority to approve judicial and executive branch nominees. He carved out an exception for people put forward for the Supreme Court. The next year – with CNN describing President Obama as an “unpopular president limping through his second term” – Republicans reclaimed control of the Senate. As a result of that achievement, President Obama’s chances of securing a liberal majority on the high court all but disappeared.

The Chicago Bears have had more starting quarterbacks in the last 10 years than the total number of tenured (UW) faculty fired during the last two decades.	The University of Missouri is still facing enrollment and budgetary problems, including a $49 million budget shortfall, as a result of the 2015 social justice protests that caught national media attention. Many people remember the high-pitched yell of former University of Missouri professor Melissa Click. Click found herself at the center of weeks of unrest at the University of Missouri in 2015 and 2016. Click rose to infamy after a video of her calling for a student photojournalist to be physically removed from campus simply because he was documenting the protests. The protests involved accusations by students that the administration had mishandled several alleged racial issues on campus.
Jim Dunnam has not lived in the district he represents for years now.	You've got to look at every issue from all sides." "I really have been pleasantly surprised how willing he is to tell Chuck Schumer to go fly a kite," she added, referring to the Senate minority leader. At other times, however, Jones has taken up liberal positions seen as risky for a Democratic senator from a GOP state. He aligned himself with most of his Democratic colleagues against Gina Haspel, Trump's pick for CIA director, arguing that her record on enhanced interrogation techniques was unacceptable. And instead of focusing on a politically safe issue in his maiden Senate floor speech, Jones struck a nerve by calling for a dialogue on gun violence after the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida.

The organization is pushing to let families stay another six months. U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin of Massachusetts wrote that ending the program would drain other public resources. He also said the evidence showed problems with the Federal Emergency Management Agency's efforts to notify and provide transitional help for the hurricane refugees. "The irreparable harm to the plaintiffs is obvious and overwhelming; tomorrow morning they will be evicted and homeless since by definition each plaintiff's home was rendered uninhabitable by the hurricane in Puerto Rico," he wrote in his decision. FEMA declined to comment on the lawsuit, but the Orlando Sentinel reports the agency confirmed it was working to notify hotels to extend the aid until July 5 to comply with the order.
Says GOP primary opponents Glenn Grothman and Joe Leibham cast a compromise vote that cost $788 million in higher electricity costs.	“Sea levels have hardly risen and temperatures are still below those of the medieval warm period. Over time, temperature change seems to correlate rather more with sun spot activity than with carbon dioxide levels. “And even if carbon dioxide, a naturally occurring trace gas that’s necessary for life, really is the main climate change villain, Australia’s contribution to mankind’s emissions is scarcely more than 1%.”
Abbott framed his contribution not as a deliberate wrecking exercise but as an effort to “save” the government. “Far from wrecking the government, MPs worried about energy policy are trying to save it, with a policy that would be different from Labor’s and would give voters the affordable and reliable power they want.”
"For the first time in history, the share of the national popular vote margin is smaller than the Latino vote margin."	"Peace and tranquility are the fruits of justice," Lopez Obrador said. Exit polling by Consulta Mitofsky for the Televisa network forecast gubernatorial wins for allies of Lopez Obrador's Morena party in at least four of eight state races on the ballot plus for the head of government in Mexico City. The central state of Guanajuato was expected to go to a candidate of the conservative National Action Party. Mitofsky predicted Morena allies would take between 56 and 70 seats in the 128-member Senate and between 256 and 291 spots in the 500-seat lower house. "The anger that the average Mexican feels toward the way things are being governed has favored Lopez Obrador," said Shannon O'Neil, senior fellow for Latin America Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.
"Since 2000, nearly 12 million Americans have slipped out of the middle class and into poverty."	DAVID BRODY:

"When Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts, we didnt just slow the rate of growth of our government, we actually cut it."	Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.

A writer for Slate magazine claimed:
Under the Trump administration, even naturalized citizens are now a target. The government agency that oversees immigration applications is hiring lawyers and immigration officers to review cases of immigrants suspected of obtaining citizenship through fake identities or other false information on their applications. Cases would be referred to the Department of Justice, where offenders could lose their citizenship or legal status.
Most of the (Affordable Care Act) has already in some sense been waived or otherwise suspended.	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.

The Labour leader has said the result of the 2016 vote should be respected, but his frontbenchers have been careful not to explicitly rule out a second referendum if the circumstances change. Earlier in the day, Len McCluskey, Unite’s general secretary, said May’s government had lost all authority or capacity to make decisions. “We are not, I repeat for my friends in the media, not, calling for a second referendum … But we remain open to the possibility of a vote on any deal the Tories come back with,” he said. “These people see in Brexit the chance to turn Britain into the low-wage, deregulated, race-to-the-bottom society of their dreams. But Brexit is turning into a nightmare for the rest of us – a nightmare of uncertainty above all.
McCain opposed a requirement that the government buy American-made motorcycles. And he said all buy-American provisions were quote 'disgraceful.' 	Straight-A students are being turned away from British medical schools and forced to pay for training in Eastern Europe, while the National Health Service (NHS) plunders the Third World for already-trained doctors instead. The Daily Mail spoke to a number of star students who earned top A-levels and supplemented their CVs with spells volunteering at local GP surgeries, overseas clinics, hospices, and pharmacies — and even earned degrees in related fields such as Biomedical Science — who were turned away from British medical schools, despite the NHS facing a shortfall of some 10,000 doctors. Department of Health and Social Care figures show that only 6,000 of 18,000 medical school applicants were awarded places last year — with many of the 6,000 likely going to foreign applicants, who have often been favoured over British applicants. In fact, the Mail found that so many talented would-be medical students were being rejected that a cottage industry of English-language medical schools in countries such as Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Armenia, and Georgia have sprung up to cater to them — but even this option is not available to youngsters who cannot afford the fees.

"U.S. Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., and his fellow Democrats went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out"	In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners.

"Almost 100,000 people left Puerto Rico last year."

Saturday night's decision came shortly after civil rights group LatinoJustice PRLDEF filed a lawsuit seeking relief for the Puerto Ricans, whose federal housing assistance vouchers were set to expire at midnight Sunday, meaning the evacuees could have been evicted from the hotels. The order says the agency cannot end its Transitional Sheltering Assistance program until at least midnight on Tuesday. The organization is pushing to let families stay another six months. U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin of Massachusetts wrote that ending the program would drain other public resources.

The United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the free world.	The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said. Carney said the impact from the president’s use of import tariffs against major trading partners including the EU and China, alongside their retaliatory measures, was already being seen through measures of global exports and manufacturing in recent weeks. “There are some tentative signs that this more hostile and uncertain trading environment may be dampening activity,” he said. Surveys of factory output in the US and the eurozone earlier this week showed firms were facing higher prices as a consequence of the import tariffs, as well as American manufacturers having the longest delivery delays on record.
We just had the best year for the auto industry in America in history.

Toyota on June 27 said that Trump's threatened 25 percent tariff on automotive imports would add $1,800 to the price of each sedan. The carmaker's warning of the dangers of tit-for-tat tariffs was just one of many. German lighting manufacturer Osram Licht's shares plunged 22 percent Thursday after it announced a weaker outlook due to trade tensions.
"Says Scott Walker favors cutting up to 350,000 families and children off health care."	But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits.

Tackett said he's concerned about children, especially in Eastern Kentucky, which has a higher rate of Medicaid patients and some of the state's worst oral health. "I have no problem with them regulating the adults that are on Medicaid," Tackett said. "If they are young and healthy, they should be out working or doing something.

According to the New York Times, the Supreme court’s decision will affect these left-wing groups and causes. “If the progressive movement is a navy, they’re trying to take out our aircraft carriers,” said Ben Wikler, of MoveOn.org, the Times reported. However, progressive groups are optimistic that the loss of union funds will be compensated for with grass-roots activism.

Says Paul Ryan is still endorsing Trump.	"Congressman Jordan never saw any abuse, never heard about any abuse, and never had any abuse reported to him during his time as a coach at Ohio State," Ian Fury, Jordan's spokesman, said in a statement. "He has not been contacted by investigators about the matter but will assist them in any way they ask, because if what is alleged is true, the victims deserve a full investigation and justice." In April, university officials announced they were investigating accusations that Dr. Richard Strauss, who died in 2005, had abused young wrestlers for more than two decades, starting in the mid-1970s. Jordan, who has served in the House since 2007, repeatedly has said he only learned about the alleged abuse this spring, when former students began speaking out. On Tuesday there were conflicting claims Jordan that had been contacted by the university's law firm regarding the investigation.
"If you look at states that are right to work, they constantly do not have budget deficits and they have very good business climates."	That will allow Trump to argue that his tough approach to trade is paying off. There are reasons why the US economy is currently strong, but none of them have anything to do with tariffs on imports. In part, it is the lagged effect of a buoyant global economy in 2017; in part it is explained by tax cuts and the stimulus still being provided by only gently rising interest rates. Mickey Levy, chief US economist for Berenberg, says Trump’s deregulation agenda has been a factor in boosting America’s underlying growth rate. Evidence from Barack Obama’s presidency shows how protectionist policies can backfire.

Split those revenues, with 35 percent going to K-12 education, 35 percent to roads, 15 percent to the communities that allow marijuana businesses in their communities and 15 percent to counties where marijuana business are located.

Behind tall brick walls and secure windows, hundreds of patients at Washington state's largest psychiatric hospital live in conditions that fail U.S. health and safety standards, while overworked nurses and psychiatrists say they are navigating a system that punishes employees who speak out despite critical staffing shortages. "They don't have enough staff to protect patients, or provide them with the bare minimum of care," said Lisa Bowser, whose mother spent two years at Western State Hospital and suffered dozens of falls and assaults. "Going there was like going into hell," said Bowser, who has sued the state-run facility. "I honestly thought they would kill her before I could get her out."

"Under President George W. Bush, we added $4.9 trillion to the debt. Under President Obama weve added $6.5 trillion to the debt."	In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions.

Says Ohio budget item later signed into law by Gov. John Kasich requires women seeking an abortion to undergo a mandatory vaginal probe.	People who use home genetic testing kits to unlock the mysteries of their ancestry tend to “cherry pick” the results, relying on preconceived biases to embrace some of the findings while disregarding others, new research suggests. Home genetic testing has become a multibillion-dollar industry that has seen millions of people around the world sign up for swab kits in hopes of uncovering the secrets hidden in their genomes. Researchers at Vancouver’s University of British Columbia focused on how the results shape perceptions of race and ethnicity. They interviewed 100 Americans from various ethnic and racial backgrounds who had taken the tests, returning to them 18 months later to examine whether the tests had gradually shifted how they saw their identity. The findings, published this week in the American Journal of Sociology, showed that most of participants – 59% – did not alter their views on their identity, despite receiving new information from the tests.

"Obamacare will provide insurance to all non-U.S. residents, even if they are here illegally."	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
President Barack Obama took exactly none of his own deficit reduction commissions ideas. Not one.	Even though he received what he called a “shellacking” in the 2010 midterms, and even though the GOP made unprecedented political gains during his tenure, President Obama was always convinced the country was behind him. As Mara Liasson wrote for NPR in 2016: “During Obama's eight years in office, the Democrats have lost more House, Senate, state legislative and governors seats than under any other president.” She noted that the Obama legacy includes “one huge failure: a diminished Democratic Party.”
In 2013, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., invoked the so-called “nuclear option,” discarding traditional filibuster protections for the minority party in favor of requiring only a simple majority to approve judicial and executive branch nominees. He carved out an exception for people put forward for the Supreme Court. The next year – with CNN describing President Obama as an “unpopular president limping through his second term” – Republicans reclaimed control of the Senate. As a result of that achievement, President Obama’s chances of securing a liberal majority on the high court all but disappeared.
It was under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton that changed the rules of engagement that probably cost (Capt. Humayun Khans) life.	Though they won’t admit it, Democrats are suffering continued fallout from the arrogance of the Obama White House. Liberals are furious that President Trump will have the opportunity to appoint another justice to the Supreme Court, thus cementing a conservative majority for the foreseeable future. Moreover, liberals are upset that the Trump administration may have convinced Justice Anthony Kennedy to recently announce his retirement, viewing that effort as dirty pool. That Kennedy, age 81, is nobody’s fool – and is unlikely to have been manipulated – appears irrelevant. The real offense, which actually merits outrage from the left, is that President Obama did not convince liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to retire during the many years that Democrats controlled the Senate.

The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.

"In 2008, only 54 percent of Latinos in Texas were registered to vote and only 35 percent actually turned out."	Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.
Only 2 percent of public high schools in the country offer PE classes.	In the lead-up to the upcoming NATO summit in Brussels, President Donald Trump has reportedly sent “sharply worded letters” to the leaders of several NATO allies, escalating his long-simmering feud with the military alliance. The New York Times reported Monday that the letters, sent last month to leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Prime Minister Charles Michel of Belgium, rebuked NATO allies for not spending enough on their own defense ― a criticism that Trump has repeatedly leveled against other alliance members. The president also suggested in the letters that the U.S. would consider reducing its military commitment globally if its allies don’t ramp up spending, reported the Times. In his letter to Merkel, Trump reportedly wrote: “There is growing frustration in the United States that some allies have not stepped up as promised. The United States continues to devote more resources to the defense of Europe when the Continent’s economy, including Germany’s, are doing well and security challenges abound.

"There are 321,092 public school teachers in Texas. And there are 313,850 non-teachers in our public schools."	Hamilton, the Republican state lawmaker who beat the incumbent Karnes, won with a mix of support from teachers and other unions. While Karnes sparred with teachers during the strike, Hamilton took a moderate position.

But he said Pitts's extensive conversations with the undercover FBI employee, combined with a criminal record that included charges for assault, domestic violence and carrying a concealed weapon, gave agents cause for concern. He said the FBI arrested Pitts after he met with the undercover employee for a final time Sunday. "We don't have the luxury of hoping that an individual decides not to harm someone or get others to act, especially when his continued repeated intentions were to do just that," Anthony said.

U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey gave the government the power to electronically spy on Americans without a warrant.	NEW YORK — House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) has referred 15 individuals, including longtime Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal, for possible “open setting” testimony in the ongoing Russia investigation. The list was sent to House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA). Many of the names are tied to the discredited anti-Trump dossier produced by the controversial Fusion GPS firm, which was paid for its dossier work by both Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) via the Perkins Coie lawfirm. Indeed, Perkins Coie attorney Marc E. Elias, who reportedly was involved in arranging the payments that resulted in the dossier, made the Nunes list. As did Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson.
Alex Sink funneled three quarters of a million dollars in no-bid contracts to Bank of America.	That leaves the broader theory that Deutsche Bank’s loans to Trump were somehow illicit. Yet this, too, doesn’t add up. How would the White House leverage that information against Anthony Kennedy? Trump would have to threaten to reveal it to the public—but that would incriminate him, too. Assume, for the sake of argument, that Justin Kennedy did commit a white-collar crime in his dealings with Trump.

"Under Obama, home values in Florida collapsed, construction jobs were lost and the state had a high foreclosure rate."	The U.S. economy continues to show strength in the wake of tax reform and deregulation, but the downside of robust growth is that Donald Trump thinks this means he can dabble at trade war with impunity. He ought to look at the signs that growth would be even stronger if not for his border-tax brawls. The latest evidence came in the minutes released Thursday from the Federal Open Market Committee’s June meeting. Fed district presidents from around the U.S. reported evidence of strong growth, but along the way came this warning:

“However, many District contacts expressed concern about the possible adverse effects of tariffs and other proposed trade restrictions, both domestically and abroad, on future investment activity; contacts in some Districts indicated that plans for capital spending had been scaled back or postponed as a result of uncertainty over trade policy.”
The minutes continued: “Contacts in the steel and aluminum industries expected higher prices as a result of the tariffs on these products but had not planned any new investments to increase capacity. Conditions in the agricultural sector reportedly improved somewhat, but contacts were concerned about the effect of potentially higher tariffs on their exports.”
These reports are from the economy’s ground floor, not the Beltway penthouse.

LONDON — Over the past century American and British troops have fought side-by-side in two World Wars, Korea and the conflicts in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan. But some lawmakers and experts in the United Kingdom are warning that the British military could soon be seen as irrelevant by the United States unless it receives a colossal funding boost. "There is a concern that the U.K. is falling ever further behind and becoming even more useless from a U.S. point of view," said Andrew Dorman, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a think tank in London.

"During the recession, the consumer in his native perversity has begun to save. The savings rate is now 6.2 percent."	The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.
On whether a U.S. Supreme Court nominee should be forthcoming at confirmation hearings.	In what ways should these concerns shape congressional expectations about transparency of the nominee vetting process and the standards for recusal in cases involving President Trump’s legal affairs? Consider first the not-unlikely prospect of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who has developed a robust view of presidential immunity from legal process fully consistent with some of the more aggressive positions of the president and his legal team. Kavanaugh has written that:
Congress might consider a law exempting a President—while in office—from criminal prosecution and investigation, including from questioning by criminal prosecutors or defense counsel. Criminal investigations targeted at or revolving around a President are inevitably politicized by both their supporters and critics. As I have written before, “no Attorney General or special counsel will have the necessary credibility to avoid the inevitable charges that he is politically motivated—whether in favor of the President or against him, depending on the individual leading the investigation and its results.” The indictment and trial of a sitting President, moreover, would cripple the federal government, rendering it unable to function with credibility in either the international or domestic arenas.

Ahmed Khudida Burjus, the deputy director of Yazda, a U.S.-based Yazidi rights group, says around 7,000 women and girls were captured and sold into slavery, with nearly half eventually escaping. In Kocho alone, at least 500 men and boys were killed, and 800 women and girls taken away. The group has documented at least 54 mass graves of Yazidis, but says a lack of resources has delayed the exhumation of the remains, and that there may be more graves yet to be discovered. Over the past three years, Syrian and Iraqi forces have gradually driven IS out of nearly all the territory it once held.

In turn, that means American firms in China could soon find their new product models at the bottom of the regulatory pile for things like safety approvals, or their state-owned Chinese partners might shift resources toward European joint ventures instead. China has a history of this sort of bureaucratic malfeasance, with its consumers often helping out.
Says Scott Brown co-sponsored legislation to let employers deny women coverage for birth control.	This is just terrible timing all around." Medicaid, an $11 billion, state-federal health plan in Kentucky, covers 1.4 million people, about 600,000 of them children. The federal government provides about 80 percent of the state's Medicaid funds. The cuts to dental and vision benefits were supposed to affect only able-bodied adults, mostly those added to Medicaid under an expansion authorized through the Affordable Care Act.
"At some point in their lives, 99% of women use birth control."	"Unlike our forerunners in 1968, those of us living today have access to something they didn't," said Mary Eberstadt, a widely published Catholic writer, "50 years of sociological, psychological, medical, and other evidence about the revolution's fallout." Some of the lines in Humanae Vitae, when stripped of mid-20th century cultural references, find echoes in contemporary concerns about nonconsensual sexual relations. "A man who grows accustomed to the use of contraceptive methods may forget the reverence due to a woman," the pope wrote, "... and reduce her to a mere instrument of his own desires." "This document that has been so controversial and in many places reviled," Eberstadt says, "actually called the shots on what the future would look like better than any other single source I could think of." Revisionist views of the 1968 encyclical have even taken hold among some Catholics who have not abided by its teaching.
"In the past 20 years, Egypt has made great strides in political and democratic reform."	Calls for an Iran without its current “dictatorial regime” were met with strengthened hope during the annual “free Iran” rally held in Paris this past weekend by the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), an exiled Paris-based Iranian opposition group allied with the Mujaheddin-e-Khalq (MEK). The rally, which event organizers said saw more than 100,000 attendees, took place at the Villepinte Congress Center, outside of Paris on Saturday. A series of panel discussions ranging in topic from women’s rights to denuclearization took place on Friday. The Guardian reported there was “a crowd of about 4,000, many of them refugees and young eastern Europeans who had been bussed in to attend the rally in return for a weekend trip to Paris.”
Distinguished speakers at Saturday’s event included former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal attorney; New Mexico’s former Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson; former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich; former Sen. Robert Torricelli (D-NJ); former FBI Director Louis Freeh; former Homeland Security Adviser Frances Townsend; and former U.S. Army chief of staff Gen. George Casey.
The amount of attention paid this week to Chris Christie makes the coverage of Benghazi ... pale in significance.	Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
Says U.S. Rep. Steve Southerland voted to keep the shutdown going.	Nearly 600 more retail jobs are to go in the UK as the Jacques Vert, Windsmoor and Precis department store brands are wound down by administrators. Administrators said they had failed to find a buyer for Calvetron Brands, which had been restructured following a rescue deal last summer. The business entered administration in May and had already shed more than 400 jobs before Wednesday’s announcement. The latest retail job losses come as more than 30,000 jobs are at risk in the UK following mass closure announcements by major chains including House of Fraser, New Look and Marks & Spencer. Retailers are suffering from rising costs and the switch to online shopping just as hard-pressed consumers rein in spending.
"In Rick Perrys Texas, we import nurses ... from other countries."	Crimes such as robbery remain rampant across Venezuela amid the country’s dire economic and humanitarian crisis, leading growing numbers of people to turn to violence merely to ensure survival. Kidnappings, armed robberies, and violent attacks are now commonplace. Venezuela is widely considered one of the most dangerous destinations in the world. As noted by El Nacional, “There are many travelers who have been stripped of money, luggage, and vehicles on the Caracas-La Guaira highway, especially at night and early morning when the road is little traveled and lacks surveillance.”
The doctors were present in Venezuela as part of an agreement between the two countries. Venezuela typically pays for the doctors in vast quantities of oil, an initiative that started under Hugo Chávez and Fidel Castro.
There is a federal criminal law that says its a crime to transport dentures across state lines.	The definition of drug dealer
More and more, trouble is following fellow drug users, friends and relatives of those dying from overdoses. With the country's opioid crisis widening – having killed more people in 2016, for instance, than the deadliest year of the AIDs epidemic – bystanders to fatal overdoses are increasingly becoming criminal defendants. Pennsylvania prosecutors in Delaware County who are pursuing the case against Santa Barbara declined an interview request. But among the criminal charges they are pressing against her is drug delivery resulting in death, a first-degree felony carrying the maximum punishment of 20 to 40 years in prison. In Pennsylvania, the number of people charged with this version of third-degree murder from an accidental overdose went from 15 in 2013 to 205 last year.
We built a new prison every 10 days between 1990 and 2005 to keep up with our mass incarceration explosion of nonviolent offenders.	Practice is only one of Deborah Glass’s 125 recommendations not accepted by Victorian government
Female prisoners in Victoria are still subject to “abusive” routine strip searches, a state government watchdog says. The Victorian ombudsman, Deborah Glass, said the government has failed to adopt a recommendation from her 2015 report into the prison system that called for an end to the searches. “Why has the government not accepted my recommendation to stop the abusive practice of routinely strip-searching women prisoners – in fact, the only recommendation out of 125 not accepted?” she asked on Wednesday. The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year.
"Sen. McCain's tax plan provides ""virtually nothing to the middle class."""	3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.
Austin is burdened by the fastest-growing tax increases of any major city in the nation.	Tesla could use a lighter moment. It has had a 2018 filled with ups and downs. In May, Consumer Reports initially did not recommend the electric vehicle giant’s Model 3, its first car priced for mainstream buyers, in part because of long stopping distances, only to see the magazine relent after it flashed software to cars that improved them. Last month, Tesla topped a list of best-selling electric vehicles in the United States, selling three of the five most popular cars. And this week, Tesla announced that it had reached Musk's goal of manufacturing 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week.
"Phoenix, Arizona, is the No. 2 kidnapping capital of the world."	The woman who was flown back Thursday said she didn't know if she'd try it again. First, she needed to find out when her partner would be coming back. He was still detained in Texas. She borrowed a mobile phone to call a friend to get a ride to her small brick house that she thought she had left forever, a house containing the memories of her missing children, in a town under the grip of a gang. Asked who was waiting for her there, she looked bereft and answered weakly: "No one."
I belong to the AFL-CIO.	BREAKING: @NEAToday President @Lily_NEA reacts to radical ruling by #SCOTUS: "We are living in a system that is rigged to benefit special interests & billionaires, all at the expense of working people." FULL STATEMENT: https://t.co/uE4j5lQPGh #Janus #JanusvAFSCME #Union — NEA Public Relations (@NEAMedia) June 27, 2018
A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.
The insurance commissioner cant do squat about health care.	And when we discovered oil, it's not like we, you know, twirled our mustaches and said, mwahahaha (ph), I will destroy the planet. Instead we used it to do amazing things - heating homes, you know, making internal combustion engines. So triggering climate change was not our fault, but not doing something about it now that we've recognized it, not switching energy infrastructures now that we've recognized it - yeah, not only would that be our fault, but it would be our folly because what it would mean is - is that that would be the reason why we didn't make it across the other side. Some civilizations make it, and some don't. And that would be the reason why we wouldn't make it.
Says a poll found him the only Republican candidate who could beat Barack Obama in Texas -- and by eight points.	A prominent exit poll predicted his party allies were poised to score big victories in congressional races, possibly winning absolute majorities in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. Lopez Obrador, who campaigned on vows to transform Mexico and oust the "mafia of power" ruling the country, rode widespread voter anger and discontent with the governing Institutional Revolution Party, or PRI, of President Enrique Pena Nieto and had led opinion polls since the beginning of the campaign. The PRI, which dominated Mexican politics for nearly the entire 20th century and recaptured the presidency in 2012, was set to suffer heavy losses not just for the presidency but in other races as well. In brief remarks at a hotel in central Mexico City, Lopez Obrador called for reconciliation after a polarizing campaign and promised profound change but with respect for the law and constitutional order. "I confess that I have a legitimate ambition: I want to go down in history as a good president of Mexico," said Lopez Obrador, who had lost in the previous two presidential elections.
"President Ronald Reagan sent troops into conflict only in one circumstance, which was in Grenada We were in a peacekeeping setting in Lebanon."	Although he gave no indication he was about to order up military plans, he pointed to what he considered past cases of successful gunboat diplomacy in the region, according to the official, like the invasions of Panama and Grenada in the 1980s. The idea, despite his aides' best attempts to shoot it down, would nonetheless persist in the president's head. The next day, Aug. 11, Trump alarmed friends and foes alike with talk of a "military option" to remove Maduro from power. The public remarks were initially dismissed in U.S. policy circles as the sort of martial bluster people have come to expect from the reality TV star turned commander in chief.
Says David Jolly supports privatizing Social Security.	Hamilton, the Republican state lawmaker who beat the incumbent Karnes, won with a mix of support from teachers and other unions. While Karnes sparred with teachers during the strike, Hamilton took a moderate position. He aligned with teachers unions by opposing state right-to-work legislation and the proposed repeal of prevailing wage laws for public construction projects. The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.

"Since 1968, more Americans have died from gunfire than died in all the wars of this countrys history."	On this much police and activist South Side priest Michael Pfleger can agree: Saturday morning’s anti-violence march on the Dan Ryan Expressway is all about danger. Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.
A foreclosure tax that would take effect in 2013 could mean a high tax bill for those facing foreclosure and millions of families who modified their mortgage or had a short sale through their lender.	The proposal would:
Legalize the possession and sale of up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana for personal, recreational use for people over the age of 21. A person could keep up to 10 ounces of marijuana at home. Tax marijuana sales with a 10 percent excise tax at the retail level as well as the state's 6 percent sales tax. Split those revenues, with 35 percent going to K-12 education, 35 percent to roads, 15 percent to the communities that allow marijuana businesses in their communities and 15 percent to counties where marijuana business are located. Allow communities to decide whether they’ll allow marijuana businesses in their towns.

"Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, would help lift over a million Americans out of poverty."	America has a love-hate relationship with Walmart (WMT), sparking debates about whether the giant retailer helps or hurts the country's economy. It turns out that Walmart might be helping one segment that's overlooked in the debate: low-income families who struggle with food insecurity, according to new research from economists at Georgia State University, Nairobi's Columbia Global Centers and Samford University, and funded by the University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Some municipalities have sought to block or restrict Walmart from opening up within their borders, often on the grounds that a new Walmart could hurt local businesses. The researchers said they wanted to come at the question of Walmart's impact from another direction: "Are barriers to Walmart's entry at odds with the goal of eliminating hunger?"
"Says Secretary of State John Kerry, when he was a senator, flew to Managua and met with a communist dictator there, Daniel Ortega, and accused the Reagan administration of engaging in terrorism."	Under the sanctions, any assets belonging to the three officials in the United States are blocked and U.S. citizens are prohibited from engaging in transactions with them or entities they own or control, the Treasury said in a statement. “The violence perpetrated by the government of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega against the Nicaraguan people and the efforts of those close to the Ortega regime to illicitly enrich themselves is deeply disturbing and completely unacceptable,” Sigal Mandelker, undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a statement. The United States accused Madriz of ordering the Nicaraguan police to set fire to a house in the capital, Managua, killing six people, including two children. It said police also asked gang leaders in Nicaragua to attack anti-government protesters, fired on and killed peaceful protesters. Briones ordered attacks against elderly and young people protesting peacefully, ordered violent attacks against anti-government marchers and beat protesters and stole money from Managua municipal projects, according to the Treasury.
"NATO is opening up a major terror division. ... Im sure Im not going to get credit for it, but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO."	In the lead-up to the upcoming NATO summit in Brussels, President Donald Trump has reportedly sent “sharply worded letters” to the leaders of several NATO allies, escalating his long-simmering feud with the military alliance. The New York Times reported Monday that the letters, sent last month to leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Prime Minister Charles Michel of Belgium, rebuked NATO allies for not spending enough on their own defense ― a criticism that Trump has repeatedly leveled against other alliance members. The president also suggested in the letters that the U.S. would consider reducing its military commitment globally if its allies don’t ramp up spending, reported the Times. In his letter to Merkel, Trump reportedly wrote: “There is growing frustration in the United States that some allies have not stepped up as promised. The United States continues to devote more resources to the defense of Europe when the Continent’s economy, including Germany’s, are doing well and security challenges abound.

"Since Gina Raimondo took office, investment fees on the states pension portfolio have gone up from about $12 million annually to about $50 million."	Even Pruitt’s own staff had begun to sour on him, with many worrying that their future career prospects would be damaged by their association with Pruitt’s tenure. Each scandal seemed more damning than the last. Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.

While other data on Thursday showed private payrolls rising less than expected last month and a surprise increase in new applications for unemployment benefits last week, overall labor market conditions continue to tighten. The labor market is considered to be near or at full employment, with the jobless rate at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent. The unemployment rate has dropped by three-tenths of a percentage point this year and is near the Federal Reserve’s forecast of 3.6 percent by the end of this year.

Teachers are also running a ballot measure campaign that would tax the highest income earners for an additional $690 million to spend on schools. “Regardless of political parties, we need people to make a decision about what’s happening in the classroom,” said Marisol Garcia, vice president of the Arizona Education Association. “To limit ourselves and to say ‘only these people are going to support us’ is just not true.”
Teachers can be at a disadvantage compared to wealthier candidates, who tend to have built-in networks of potential donors.
Two-thirds of Wisconsinites receiving unemployment checks are not required to search for work due to current work search exemptions.	WASHINGTON—The number of Americans filing applications for new unemployment benefits rose last week but remained near historic lows. Initial jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs across the U.S., increased by 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 231,000 in the week ended June 30, the Labor Department said Thursday. Claims also rose in the week ended June 23. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected 225,000 new claims last week.
"Under President Obamas health-care reforms, the premium for an average plan for a family didnt go down by $2,500 per year, its gone up about $2,500 per year."	“That was a very sad day for the country when that vote was cast,” Trump said in June. But Republican lawmakers dispute arguments suggesting their efforts to undo ObamaCare have been totally fruitless. “We eliminated the individual mandate that said that people had to buy government-approved insurance,” said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo. “In a sense, it blew a big hole in ObamaCare.”
There’s a potential electoral landmine ahead for Republicans hoping to keep their majorities in the House and Senate, though: premium increases. “We’re going to get another round right before the election, which is something the GOP is nervous about,” said John C.

It’s a wonderful success story for state education, but it is one that is, sadly, becoming harder to replicate. Sheku’s school, along with many others across the country, is being forced to make budget cuts – and music is often first in line.
"Gov. Rick Scott cut the cost of prepaid college tuition by nearly $20,000."	But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said. Tackett said he's concerned about children, especially in Eastern Kentucky, which has a higher rate of Medicaid patients and some of the state's worst oral health. "I have no problem with them regulating the adults that are on Medicaid," Tackett said. "If they are young and healthy, they should be out working or doing something.
"The city of Columbus would save $41 million a year if employees had to contribute to their own, guaranteed-check pensions."	Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
"As Florida's CFO, I shut down Krakow's scam and refunded more than $1.2 million to Josephine and other victims of this con man."	WASHINGTON — Long before Viktor Vekselberg was tied to a scandal over the president and a porn star, the Russian oligarch had been positioning himself to extend his influence in the United States. Working closely with an American cousin who heads the New York investment management firm Columbus Nova, Vekselberg backed a $1.6 million lobbying campaign to aid Russian interests in Washington. His cousin Andrew Intrater served as CEO of a Vekselberg company on that project, and the two men have collaborated on numerous other investments involving Vekselberg's extensive holdings. Now, Intrater's investment firm is wrestling with the fallout from financial sanctions the U.S. Treasury Department lodged in April against Vekselberg, one of a group of oligarchs tied to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Columbus Nova has insisted it only managed Vekselberg's vast assets.

According to the court records, Blessing told detectives she got out two handguns she has had since the 1970s — one bought at a gun store and the other obtained from her late husband. She concealed two pistols in the pockets of her robe before confronting her son in his bedroom and firing multiple shots at him with one handgun, investigators alleged. The gun was dislodged from Blessing's hand after a struggle with her son's girlfriend, as well as the second weapon, authorities said. The unidentified woman called authorities, and Blessing was found on a recliner in the home and taken into custody.

"The years that I was speaker, the Florida House consistently offered leaner budgets than the governor offered."	In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners. Alas, he is wasting his time trying to shift the views of the Democratic Party, which has become ever more left-wing, if not outright socialist.

It’s shocking that Mr. James is surprised by the positive economic results of less regulation and lower taxes.
"We are already almost halfway to our 2010 goal of creating 700,000 new jobs in seven years."	The economy has added an average 207,000 jobs a month this year after a blowout number of 223,000 in May. Economists predict that 195,000 jobs were added in June. Unemployment stands at 3.8%, the lowest rate since 2000. If it dips to 3.7%, it will be the lowest since 1969.
Says the U.S. Supreme Court found that Social Security is not guaranteed.	Though they won’t admit it, Democrats are suffering continued fallout from the arrogance of the Obama White House. Liberals are furious that President Trump will have the opportunity to appoint another justice to the Supreme Court, thus cementing a conservative majority for the foreseeable future. Moreover, liberals are upset that the Trump administration may have convinced Justice Anthony Kennedy to recently announce his retirement, viewing that effort as dirty pool. That Kennedy, age 81, is nobody’s fool – and is unlikely to have been manipulated – appears irrelevant. The real offense, which actually merits outrage from the left, is that President Obama did not convince liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to retire during the many years that Democrats controlled the Senate.

The Labour leader has said the result of the 2016 vote should be respected, but his frontbenchers have been careful not to explicitly rule out a second referendum if the circumstances change. Earlier in the day, Len McCluskey, Unite’s general secretary, said May’s government had lost all authority or capacity to make decisions. “We are not, I repeat for my friends in the media, not, calling for a second referendum … But we remain open to the possibility of a vote on any deal the Tories come back with,” he said. “These people see in Brexit the chance to turn Britain into the low-wage, deregulated, race-to-the-bottom society of their dreams.

Newt Gingrichs immigration plan offers a new doorway to amnesty.	Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.

U.S. Government lawyers are slamming one of President Donald Trump's most prominent critics, attorney Michael Avenatti, over nearly half a million dollars in unpaid federal taxes owed by his former firm. Avenatti's former law firm, Eagan Avenatti LLP, agreed to make the roughly $452,000 tax payment last month in order to resolve a bankruptcy case, but the funds never arrived at the IRS, according to a filing Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, Calif.

Barack Obama has never even worked in business.	Ethiopia's government has fired five prison officials as it confronts allegations of torture and other abuses of inmates as part of a wave of reforms. Among those fired is the federal prison chief who until recently defended the treatment of inmates as "fair." The firings came ahead of a new Human Rights Watch report released Thursday that documents widespread arbitrary detention, torture, rape and humiliation over several years in Ethiopia's eastern Somali region. It urges new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to investigate the "horrific" situation. Abiy has admitted that security forces have tortured people but has yet to "tackle Ethiopia's culture of impunity and ensure accountability," said Felix Horne, senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch.

Corporate America couldn’t hire Republican lobbyists fast enough after President Donald Trump’s election gave the GOP unified control of Washington. Now there are signs that Democrats are back in demand. Companies and trade groups are trying to hire congressional staffers with ties to influential House Democrats four months ahead of the midterm elections, in which Democrats are expected to pick up seats and potentially retake control of the House. Lobbyists are helping their clients meet with the Democrats who would become committee chairs if the party does win back the chamber. And trade groups are talking to members about what to expect from a Democratic takeover.

Total private construction rose 0.3 percent, with residential projects up 0.8 percent in May. New single-family home construction rose 0.6 percent and the volatile apartment building sector jumped 1.6 percent. Private, non-residential building fell 0.3 percent. Economists are forecasting that construction spending will contribute to overall growth this year even though interest rates are rising.

Megan Schwab, who works with the International Rescue Committee in Boise, said the organization was working to provide temporary housing, counseling and other support to those affected by the attack.

"In 2005, Dan Branch tried to expand third-trimester abortions in Texas."	Hope Life Center in western Illinois provides unplanned pregnancy counseling and ultrasounds for about five to 10 women a week, with a mission to “erase abortion from Illinois one woman and one child at time,” according to its website. So Executive Director Debbie Case was alarmed by a change last year in the state's so-called right-of-conscience law, requiring health care providers to inform pregnant patients of all available medical options, including abortion. She said the pregnancy center even shut down for part of 2017 because its physician feared potential repercussions of violating the law, which is now temporarily blocked by the courts. Case and other anti-abortion advocates across the state hailed Tuesday’s ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court against a similar law in California on First Amendment grounds, hoping the decision will strengthen their legal battle in Illinois. “We’re definitely encouraged,” said Case, whose center is in Sterling, about two hours west of Chicago.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
Michigan and Massachusetts raised their bottle deposit and could no longer afford the program because the redemptions were so high there was no profit in there.	President Trump had suggested lifting the prohibition, which environmentalists charge would raise levels of ground ozone during warmer months, during his campaign for the White House.

While it is too early to say how the handling of waivers or the treatment of E15 may change under new leadership, one indicator was small losses in affected refiners in early Friday trading and gains in most ethanol producers. CVR Refining, Andeavor and Delek U.S. Holdings , all of which benefited from waivers granted by the EPA, had rallied by 136%, 40% and 92% in the year ended Thursday, respectively. Ethanol companies Pacific Ethanol and Green Plains had fallen by 60% and 14%, respectively. Agricultural lobbyists often portray any easing of the rules as a sop to “big oil,” but that isn’t accurate.

Im the only one whos fought against developers draining the Everglades!	Sixteen years ago, the Commons select committee for transport, local government and the regions reported on new towns in general, but this could could easily have been about Telford in particular:
"While many new towns have been economically successful, most are now experiencing major problems. Their design is inappropriate for the 21st century. Their infrastructure is aging at the same rate and many have social and economic problems...
"The new towns are no longer new and many of the quickly-built houses have reached the end of their design life. The master-plans dictated low density developments with large amounts of open space, and housing segregated from jobs, shopping and business services. These created car dependency and are now not considered sustainable.
Says Ron Johnson calls Social Security a Ponzi scheme and wants to privatize the program.	But reports suggest that the mood among some of her MPs has soured. It's not just in pre-election Bavaria that anti-migrant rhetoric has borne fruit. When the leaders of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) crowed on Tuesday that they were "hunting the union, driving it before us" they were not entirely wrong in claiming triumph over the CDU and CSU. Mrs Merkel has failed to achieve her original dream - a Europe that would truly share the responsibility for sheltering asylum seekers.
"There are 31 other states and 10,000 other cities that have the same type of policies that we just passed, referring to North Carolinas House Bill 2."	Key California lawmakers said Thursday they've reached an agreement on legislation to enshrine net neutrality provisions in state law after the Federal Communications Commission dumped rules requiring an equal playing field on the internet. California's bill is one of the nation's most aggressive efforts to continue net neutrality, and the deal comes after a bitter fight among Democrats over how far the state should go. Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener, who repudiated his own legislation when major pieces were removed two weeks ago, said those provisions have been restored under his agreement with Democratic Assemblyman Miguel Santiago. "We need to ensure the internet is an open field where everyone has access, the companies that are providing internet access are not picking winners and losers," Wiener told reporters at a Capitol news conference. Santiago came under fire from net neutrality advocates around the country when the Assembly committee he leads stripped key provisions from the legislation — a decision that drew rebukes from members of Congress, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.
Climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.	Abbott said on Tuesday night he never conceived of climate change as a moral challenge. “It was an issue, that’s all, and – at least on the actual changes we’ve so far seen – not a very significant one compared to man’s inhumanity to man; maintaining and improving living standards; and even to many other environmental issues such as degraded bush and waterways, particulate pollution, water quality in the third world, deforestation and urban overcrowding.”
He contended that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide from roughly 300 to 400 parts per million over the last century had not triggered “dramatic consequences”. Play Video 0:32 Andrew Probyn calls Tony Abbott 'destructive' in ABC report – video

Over time, temperature change seems to correlate rather more with sun spot activity than with carbon dioxide levels.
The jobs bill includes President Obamas tax on soup kitchens	They include the United States withdrawing its 28,500 troops in South Korea, ending its military drills with South Korea and stop bringing in strategic assets such as aircraft carriers and nuclear-capable bombers. North Korea hasn't repeated such specific demands since entering disarmament talks earlier this year, raising optimism that the country truly appeared to seek to improve ties with the United States. After the summit, Trump suspended annual military training with South Korea that the North has called an invasion rehearsal. But North Korea still prefers a step-by-step disarmament process with reciprocal concessions and benefits from the United States for each of the North's denuclearization steps. The ultimate rewards North Korea wants range from the easing or lifting of American-led international sanctions, the signing of a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, the establishment of diplomatic ties and the pulling out of U.S. troops in South Korea, experts say.

The University of Missouri is still facing enrollment and budgetary problems, including a $49 million budget shortfall, as a result of the 2015 social justice protests that caught national media attention. Many people remember the high-pitched yell of former University of Missouri professor Melissa Click. Click found herself at the center of weeks of unrest at the University of Missouri in 2015 and 2016. Click rose to infamy after a video of her calling for a student photojournalist to be physically removed from campus simply because he was documenting the protests. The protests involved accusations by students that the administration had mishandled several alleged racial issues on campus.
"If Milwaukee approves reducing its maximum forfeiture for marijuana possession to $50, the city would have 23 different bicycle violations that have a higher forfeiture."	The proposal would:
Legalize the possession and sale of up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana for personal, recreational use for people over the age of 21. A person could keep up to 10 ounces of marijuana at home. Tax marijuana sales with a 10 percent excise tax at the retail level as well as the state's 6 percent sales tax. Split those revenues, with 35 percent going to K-12 education, 35 percent to roads, 15 percent to the communities that allow marijuana businesses in their communities and 15 percent to counties where marijuana business are located. Allow communities to decide whether they’ll allow marijuana businesses in their towns.

"The presidents health care proposals will cause most Americans to have their premiums increased, not decreased, and hundreds of millions of people lose their current insurance coverage."	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
(Mexican immigrants) are more law-abiding than U.S. citizens and that is a statistic.	These numbers are similar to those from a February Quinnipiac poll, where 49 percent of voters said Trump was racist and 46 percent said he was not. Forty-four percent of voters said they think “racist beliefs” were a motive in Trump’s immigration policy, while 50 percent said Trump has “a sincere interest in controlling our borders.” Sixty percent said the policy of separating children from their parents at the border was a violation of human rights. Since enacting the policy, Trump and his associates have repeatedly pushed false, racist narratives to garner support, often associating immigration with high crime rates despite no evidence to support claims that immigrants commit more crime than U.S. citizens. While only 11 percent of Republican voters in the Quinnipiac poll said they think Trump is a racist, 22 percent said they believe Trump has emboldened racist people to express their beliefs publicly. The number of hate crimes rose the year Trump was elected ― the first increase in over a decade.
Says Chris Christie vetoed a jobs package of 30 bills.	Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
There are already more American jobs in the solar industry than in coal mining.	“Opening up the Galilee would generate 16,000 direct mining jobs and tens of billions in taxes.”
The report says the combined value of metallurgical and thermal coal exports will be $60.2bn in 2017-18, behind iron ore at $61.8bn. It says coal exports will be slightly lower at $58.1bn in 2018-19, and that iron ore earnings will be even lower at $57.7bn, as falling iron ore prices drive export earnings lower. The Australian characterised that event as coal reclaiming its mantle as the nation’s “top export earner”. But the report says coal export earnings will soon drop below those for iron ore again, as global coal prices fall. India's huge solar ambitions could push coal further into shade Read more
In 2019-20 coal export earnings will be just $51.1bn, while iron ore earnings will be $55.4bn.
Says Illinois gubernatorial candidate Bill Bradys first priority after winning the primary was to sponsor a bill that would mass-euthanize sheltered dogs and cats in gas chambers.	Mazzochi, an attorney, already has name recognition in DuPage County, he said, because of her experience on the College of DuPage Board. She was elected to that board in April 2015 and has been chairman or acting chairman since December 2015, which was a tumultuous time for the college. She will face Democrat James M. “Jim” Caffrey in the November election to represent the 47th district. Bellock said she was not looking for a full-time job after she retired from the Illinois House, but the governor and his team asked her to head the health care and family services department. “I look at this as a real honor,” Bellock said.
Barack Obama is in an economy thats only worsened since hes been president of the United States.	The U.S. economy continues to show strength in the wake of tax reform and deregulation, but the downside of robust growth is that Donald Trump thinks this means he can dabble at trade war with impunity. He ought to look at the signs that growth would be even stronger if not for his border-tax brawls. The latest evidence came in the minutes released Thursday from the Federal Open Market Committee’s June meeting. Fed district presidents from around the U.S. reported evidence of strong growth, but along the way came this warning:
Foreign Edition Podcast
“However, many District contacts expressed concern about the possible adverse effects of tariffs and other proposed trade restrictions, both domestically and abroad, on future investment activity; contacts in some Districts indicated that plans for capital spending had been scaled back or postponed as a result of uncertainty over trade policy.”
The minutes continued: “Contacts in the steel and aluminum industries expected higher prices as a result of the tariffs on these products but had not planned any new investments to increase capacity. Conditions in the agricultural sector reportedly improved somewhat, but contacts were concerned about the effect of potentially higher tariffs on their exports.”
These reports are from the economy’s ground floor, not the Beltway penthouse.
"Romney failed to take action against ""sanctuary cities"" in Massachusetts."	“Why are you supporting the animals of MS-13?” one tweet from @WhiteHouse directed at Harris reads, referencing a mostly Latino gang Trump has used to push his hard-line border policy. “Why are you supporting criminals moving weapons, drugs, and victims across our nation’s borders?” claims another aimed at Warren. “You must not know what ICE really does,” both missives end, using the acronym for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Neither Harris nor Warren has bought into the false claims about migrants made by the White House, and they have been vocal opponents of President Donald Trump’s zero tolerance immigration policy, which has led to thousands of children being separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border. Both women are seen as potential Democratic nominees for the 2020 presidential election.
"Says New Jersey is down nearly 200,000 jobs from its pre-recession peak and with Gov. Chris Christie New Jersey has trailed the rest of America when it comes to unemployment for 12 consecutive months."	Nonfarm payrolls surged by 223,000 jobs during that month as warm weather bolstered hiring at construction sites. June’s data is expected to show a 200,000 increase, according to a Reuters poll. The closely-watched hourly wages in May rose 0.3 percent, topping economists’ estimates. The same figure is expected in June.

Says Thomas Eric Duncan came into the United States with an elevated temperature.	Liberated in March from immigration detention, where disease and threats were allegedly rife, he had been sent to a city ravaged by decades of civil war and terror. He told me his story but asked for his real name to be withheld as he feared being targeted by the Islamist al-Shabab group because of his work warning young people in the US about the dangers of recruitment by Somali militants. 'TB contracted in detention'
Six months earlier, in a small town in Minnesota - which is home to the largest population of Somalis living in the US - it was dawn when Ahmed was driving his daughter to nursery. He noticed a large vehicle with tinted windows beginning to follow him. It seems officers from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) had been watching him closely and, after getting him to pull over, he was shackled and taken into custody.
We have been in Afghanistan longer now than we have been in any foreign land conducting a war in our nations history.	Pentagon Questioned Over Blackout On War Zone Troop Numbers
Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images
For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.
Gas prices have gone up $2 since Obama took office.	Here's a quick review: Wheeler ...
Began his career in environmental law at the EPA, as a special assistant in the agency's toxics office during President George H.W. Spent years playing various roles on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, which oversees the EPA, drafting regulations on chemical safety, air and water pollution and climate change — generally seeking to reduce government regulations on industries that generate greenhouse gases. Served as longtime aide to Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., whom you may recall from the 2015 floor speech in which he rebutted climate change science with a snowball. After leaving Congress, worked for years as a lobbyist for some of the largest coal, chemical and uranium companies in the U.S. — including the uranium mining firm that pushed for the reduction of Bears Ears National Monument, which is near one of its processing facilities.

Another one of Zittlau’s asylum clients was repeatedly raped and beaten by her husband in Guatemala. She went to the police for help, but they dismissed her claims and told her to apologize to her husband, Zittlau said. She continued to endure the abuse until she learned that her husband was molesting one of her children. She came to the U.S. last February with two of her daughters. Part of the struggle, Zittlau said, is conveying to her clients that assault shouldn’t be a part of everyday life.
Says judges get better benefits at a lower cost than everybody else in the state.	"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.

My rent’s gone from $500 to $1,000, but outside of that Amazon have been beneficial Jen Reed
It’s not strictly true to say everyone is against the three huge plant-forested glass spheres at what Amazon calls its “campus” in the heart of the city. The Bezos balls, as the conservatories are popularly known, are modelled on the greenhouses at London’s Kew Gardens, feature walkways above fig trees, ferns and rhododendrons, and provide hot-desking for Amazon workers looking for a break from the neighbouring office tower. There was nothing in that area 10 years ago,” said Jen Reed, selling jerky from another market stall. “I don’t hate Amazon the way that a lot of people hate them.
Small businesses create 70 percent of the jobs in America.	The services sector, where most Americans are employed, has now expanded for 101 consecutive months, or more than eight years. The gain was better than many economists had been expecting and depicts an overall economy that appears to be regaining momentum after a slowdown in the winter.
"Seniors with coverage under Medicare Advantage will give up ""more than their share"" because of health care reform"	“That was a very sad day for the country when that vote was cast,” Trump said in June. But Republican lawmakers dispute arguments suggesting their efforts to undo ObamaCare have been totally fruitless. “We eliminated the individual mandate that said that people had to buy government-approved insurance,” said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo. “In a sense, it blew a big hole in ObamaCare.”
There’s a potential electoral landmine ahead for Republicans hoping to keep their majorities in the House and Senate, though: premium increases. “We’re going to get another round right before the election, which is something the GOP is nervous about,” said John C.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
If Texas were a country our economy would rank # 10...in the WORLD.	That suggests that the world will have to wait for Trump to look at the incoming economic data and realise that trade wars are not as easy to win as he thinks. It could, though, be some time before the penny drops. Exports are booming and on some estimates will add a full percentage point to growth in the second quarter of 2018, a period when the US was expanding at an annual rate of around 4%. That will allow Trump to argue that his tough approach to trade is paying off. There are reasons why the US economy is currently strong, but none of them have anything to do with tariffs on imports.
There are more oil rigs in operation in the United States than the rest of the world combined.	Just hours after his historic election victory sent thousands of supporters pouring on to the streets, the 64-year-old leftist tweeted that he had received a call from Donald Trump. “I proposed that we explore an integral agreement of development projects, which generate jobs in Mexico and with that reduce migration and improve security. There was respectful treatment and our representatives will speak more.”
In an interview with the Televisa news network, López Obrador emphasized the need for mutual respect and cooperation between the two neighbors. “We are conscious of the need to maintain good relations with the United States.

"Payday lenders profit from the poor by charging 1,000-plus percent interest."	The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.
"The Social Security trust fund is sound. Without anything being done, it would function well into 2038; and even after that time with no changes, we could pay 80 percent of the benefits that people have earned."	Truly, ours is a land of tremendous opportunity. For our children, the possibilities are limitless so long as we do not squander their American inheritance. We can turn this optimism into a fortress against today’s tyranny, if we can pull ourselves together. We must collectively find the will to trust the outcomes produced by our institutions, and the institutions themselves must acknowledge their own mistakes. Rebuilding trust is a two-way street.
It is a commitment voters take very seriously: The only incumbent in Ohio to break his Pledge and vote for Ted Stricklands income tax hike was defeated soundly on Tuesday.	The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. Teachers are also running a ballot measure campaign that would tax the highest income earners for an additional $690 million to spend on schools. “Regardless of political parties, we need people to make a decision about what’s happening in the classroom,” said Marisol Garcia, vice president of the Arizona Education Association. “To limit ourselves and to say ‘only these people are going to support us’ is just not true.”
Teachers can be at a disadvantage compared to wealthier candidates, who tend to have built-in networks of potential donors.

The Republicans have 2 percent of the Muslim vote.	“They’ve twisted American values,” she said in a follow-up phone interview. “A lot of them are anti-God, anti-religion and anti-military.”
In the survey, most say they are proud to be Americans, although Republicans feel that way more strongly (90 percent) than Democrats (61 percent). There is no consensus when asked about the country’s current course, though: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. “Overwhelming majorities of those in both parties and independents agree that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.”” USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll

Eric Young, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees’ Council of Prison Locals, now prays before he looks at his phone every morning, worried he’ll receive a message from BOP’s director notifying him of a staff death. Young estimates that around two-thirds of his union members were Trump supporters. That makes sense: It’s a law enforcement agency that leans white and male (72 percent male, 62 percent white), and many federal prisons are in rural parts of the country, which Trump dominated. But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau. BOP has long suffered the kind of problems you’d expect for a massive bureaucracy centered on caging tens of thousands of people.

The central state of Guanajuato was expected to go to a candidate of the conservative National Action Party. Mitofsky predicted Morena allies would take between 56 and 70 seats in the 128-member Senate and between 256 and 291 spots in the 500-seat lower house. "The anger that the average Mexican feels toward the way things are being governed has favored Lopez Obrador," said Shannon O'Neil, senior fellow for Latin America Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.

NANTERRE, France -- French investigators believe a team of four or five loyal accomplices carried out the brazen prison helicopter escape of one of France's most notorious criminals.

Inmates could be heard cheering on cell phone video taken inside the prison during the bust. Faid's brother, Brahim, was visiting him at the time of the escape. He was detained immediately afterward and freed late Monday.

Tesla could use a lighter moment. It has had a 2018 filled with ups and downs. In May, Consumer Reports initially did not recommend the electric vehicle giant’s Model 3, its first car priced for mainstream buyers, in part because of long stopping distances, only to see the magazine relent after it flashed software to cars that improved them. Last month, Tesla topped a list of best-selling electric vehicles in the United States, selling three of the five most popular cars. And this week, Tesla announced that it had reached Musk's goal of manufacturing 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week.
Not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real.	The Republican Party is rotting away. The problem is that GOP policies just aren’t popular. Most Americans unsurprisingly oppose climate denial, tax cuts for the wealthy, and putting children (including toddlers) in concentration camps, for example. The Republican Party has thus far managed to continue winning elections by creating “a coalition between racists and plutocrats,” as Paul Krugman put it. The party’s economic policies are aimed at benefitting wealthy individuals and corporations, but that’s a slim segment of the American electorate.

Trump’s campaign to limit legal and illegal immigration is driving up wages and salaries for Americans in various locations and careers around the country. The beneficiaries include new employees, African-American bakers in Chicago, Latino restaurant workers in Monterey, Calif., disabled people nationwide, high schoolers, resort workers in Hilton Head, construction workers, Superbowl workers, the garment industry, and workers at small businesses, and even Warren Buffett’s railroad workers. Amnesty advocates rely on business-funded “Nation of Immigrants” push-polls to show apparent voter support for immigration and immigrants. But “choice” polls reveal most voters’ often-ignored preference that CEOs should hire Americans at decent wages before hiring migrants.

But they split almost down the middle, 42 percent to 39 percent, when asked whether they are proud of America right now. Not surprisingly, the split was along partisan lines: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now.

"In the last five years, 28,000 people have been killed along the U.S.-Mexico border."	If Obrador and his party, Morena, perform as expected, some conservatives worry he will have a majority and a Congressional mandate to enact sweeping reforms, including free access to the Internet, a doubling of pensions for the elderly, educational grants for students, an increase in the minimum wage and subsidies for small farmers and single mothers. “The only candidate who was truly successful positioning himself as an agent of change was AMLO,” said former PAN party foreign minister Jorge Castaneda, who believes Obrador won the election based on three issues: violence, corruption and the economy. “In the last twenty-odd years, this includes the government I served in, the economy has not grown more than two and a half percent per year,” Castaneda said. “Mexicans are not finding deep well-paying jobs, not seeing their living standards improved, not extracting people from poverty, we’re not reducing levels of inequality which are among the highest levels in the world.”
Almost 44 percent of Mexicans live below the national poverty line, earning less than $5 per day, according to the World Bank. Poverty is most extreme in the rural south, where unemployment and violence remain highest.

Eric Young, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees’ Council of Prison Locals, now prays before he looks at his phone every morning, worried he’ll receive a message from BOP’s director notifying him of a staff death. Young estimates that around two-thirds of his union members were Trump supporters. That makes sense: It’s a law enforcement agency that leans white and male (72 percent male, 62 percent white), and many federal prisons are in rural parts of the country, which Trump dominated. But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau. BOP has long suffered the kind of problems you’d expect for a massive bureaucracy centered on caging tens of thousands of people.
Says Rick Scott called education not a core function of the state.	'We’re going to run different'
His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
"The Family Research Council, according to some government agencies, is a terrorist group."	The AntiFa group organized some distance away but not before police seized weapons such as utility knives, clubs and chemical sprays, according to The Oregonian. Despite the confiscations, the AntiFa group initiated hostilities by throwing eggs, bottles, and other items at the Patriot group, the paper noted. Officers reported witnessing incidents of assault and soon revoked the Patriot group’s permit and began forcing both groups to leave the area. Antifa activists left graffiti in their wake according to Twitter users:

"I have no problem with them regulating the adults that are on Medicaid," Tackett said. "If they are young and healthy, they should be out working or doing something.
Says that in the 1985 election former Gov. Tom Kean had the largest winning margin for a gubernatorial candidate in Jersey history.	Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
Obamacare is the biggest tax increase in American history.	And then you have the old guard, like Pelosi and others at the top. And there is no overall messaging that is bringing that all together.

Ethiopia's government has fired five prison officials as it confronts allegations of torture and other abuses of inmates as part of a wave of reforms. Among those fired is the federal prison chief who until recently defended the treatment of inmates as "fair." The firings came ahead of a new Human Rights Watch report released Thursday that documents widespread arbitrary detention, torture, rape and humiliation over several years in Ethiopia's eastern Somali region. It urges new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to investigate the "horrific" situation. Abiy has admitted that security forces have tortured people but has yet to "tackle Ethiopia's culture of impunity and ensure accountability," said Felix Horne, senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch.

NANTERRE, France -- French investigators believe a team of four or five loyal accomplices carried out the brazen prison helicopter escape of one of France's most notorious criminals. The armed, masked men took a helicopter pilot hostage, forced him to land Sunday in Reau Prison's yard, used power tools to break through the prison yard's doors and hustled Redoine Faid to freedom. Inmates could be heard cheering on cell phone video taken inside the prison during the bust. Faid's brother, Brahim, was visiting him at the time of the escape. He was detained immediately afterward and freed late Monday.

A new USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll about patriotism, pegged to this week's celebration of the Fourth of July, finds an overwhelming majority of those surveyed — 90 percent — say they are proud to be Americans. But they split almost down the middle, 42 percent to 39 percent, when asked whether they are proud of America right now. Not surprisingly, the split was along partisan lines: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. There was bipartisan agreement on one thing: Across party lines, roughly seven in 10 agree with the statement, "I feel fatigued watching the news." Elsewhere in politics

Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, one of the most powerful conservatives in Congress, has denied reports that he ignored the alleged sexual abuse of athletes while he worked as an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University more than 20 years ago. Allegations that Jordan was aware of sexual misconduct and explicitly was informed of specific incidents of alleged assault by the wrestling team's doctor, first surfaced in an NBC news story on Tuesday. But Jordan — who was an assistant coach from 1987 until 1995, when he was elected to the state legislature — has refuted the claims. "Congressman Jordan never saw any abuse, never heard about any abuse, and never had any abuse reported to him during his time as a coach at Ohio State," Ian Fury, Jordan's spokesman, said in a statement. "He has not been contacted by investigators about the matter but will assist them in any way they ask, because if what is alleged is true, the victims deserve a full investigation and justice."Rep.

Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.

"Milwaukee County taxpayers paid $370,000 to settle a lawsuit over a decision by Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. to use untrained corrections officers rather than deputies to patrol the lakefront."	Practice is only one of Deborah Glass’s 125 recommendations not accepted by Victorian government
Female prisoners in Victoria are still subject to “abusive” routine strip searches, a state government watchdog says. The Victorian ombudsman, Deborah Glass, said the government has failed to adopt a recommendation from her 2015 report into the prison system that called for an end to the searches. “Why has the government not accepted my recommendation to stop the abusive practice of routinely strip-searching women prisoners – in fact, the only recommendation out of 125 not accepted?” she asked on Wednesday. The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year.
There are Justice Department policies against FBI Director James Comey discussing details of a federal investigation so close to an election.	In what ways should these concerns shape congressional expectations about transparency of the nominee vetting process and the standards for recusal in cases involving President Trump’s legal affairs? Consider first the not-unlikely prospect of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who has developed a robust view of presidential immunity from legal process fully consistent with some of the more aggressive positions of the president and his legal team. Kavanaugh has written that:
Congress might consider a law exempting a President—while in office—from criminal prosecution and investigation, including from questioning by criminal prosecutors or defense counsel. Criminal investigations targeted at or revolving around a President are inevitably politicized by both their supporters and critics. As I have written before, “no Attorney General or special counsel will have the necessary credibility to avoid the inevitable charges that he is politically motivated—whether in favor of the President or against him, depending on the individual leading the investigation and its results.” The indictment and trial of a sitting President, moreover, would cripple the federal government, rendering it unable to function with credibility in either the international or domestic arenas.

"Says David Perdue wants to abolish the U.S. Department of Education, which would cost Georgia schools $1 billion a year and eliminate millions in student loans."	The federal government provides about 80 percent of the state's Medicaid funds. The cuts to dental and vision benefits were supposed to affect only able-bodied adults, mostly those added to Medicaid under an expansion authorized through the Affordable Care Act. Advocates say the cutoff of vision and dental benefits is unnecessary and possibly illegal. Bevin's administration announced the cuts after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Friday rejected Bevin's sweeping plan to overhaul the state's Medicaid program. The plan would have eliminated dental and vision benefits for such individuals, although they could earn points toward purchasing such services with a "My Rewards" account through activities such as volunteering or taking online classes.
The Paul Ryan budget proposal would privatize Medicare.	President Trump’s reshaping of the GOP from being aligned to the Chamber of Commerce to a party serving the interests of America’s working and middle class is winning over young white American men en masse. Ahead of Trump’s election to the presidency in 2016, nearly 50 percent of young white men favored Democrats, and 36 percent favored the GOP. That 14-point gain has flipped, and young white men now favor the GOP over the Democrats by 46 percent to 37 percent. At the time, the GOP was aligned with the big business lobby and Wall Street in promoting endless multinational free trade that readily outsourced American jobs to foreign countries. The Republican establishment, in 2016, was pushing the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which would have eliminated millions of working and middle-class jobs while also driving down wages for remaining American workers.

The NHS will consume 66% of the Welsh budget by 2048 if demand increases in line with predicted demand, according to new research. Health economist Prof Ceri Phillips said spending on the NHS would need to rise by 4% a year. Currently £6bn out of a total Welsh budget of £14.5bn goes to the NHS. The Welsh Government said its Health and Social Care Plan aimed to reduce demand through more people managing their own health and well-being. BBC Wales Investigates had asked Prof Phillips, from Swansea University, to question existing projections for healthcare in Wales and then calculate how much extra spending would be needed to keep the NHS afloat.

Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods.

In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.

The report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that employers created 213,000 new jobs in June — 22,000 more than economists had expected. Manufacturing jobs in particular rose by 36,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.

"Obama's budget plan would take national debt up to about 80 percent of gross national product. ... Historically, it's been about 40 percent."	Delivering a speech in Newcastle on Thursday, he said: “At the moment, protectionism is largely just talk (and tweets). But what if rhetoric becomes reality?”
Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.
Says Hillary Clinton said the Veterans Affairs scandal is over-exaggerated. She said she was satisfied with what was going on.	Mrs May said she would not comment on a leaked report that the government had not yet seen. She said the government would consider it when it received it. (you can read the BBC story on it here)
She then said all donations to the Scottish Conservatives were accepted and declared in accordance with the law after Mr Blackford accused the party of "systematically shielding donations from public scrutiny". Referring to reports on the Ferret website, he alleged the Scottish Conservatives had received £319,000 from the Scottish Unionist Association Trust and said there was no information about who manages the trust, who its donors are or its assets. He urged the prime minister to reveal what checks had taken place before the money was accepted and for an investigation.
We now have driven (health care) costs down to the lowest theyve been in 50 years.	For them, expedited approval can mean not only sped-up sales but also — if the drug is intended to treat a rare disease or serve a neglected population — FDA incentives worth hundreds of millions of dollars. “Instead of a regulator and a regulated industry, we now have a partnership,” said Dr. Michael Carome, director of the health research group for the nonprofit advocacy organization Public Citizen, and a former U.S. Department of Health and Human Services official. “That relationship has tilted the agency away from a public health perspective to an industry friendly perspective.”

While the FDA over the past three decades has implemented at least four major routes to faster approvals — the current commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, is easing even more drugs’ path to market. The FDA okayed 46 “novel” drugs — whose chemical structure hadn’t been previously approved — in 2017, the most in at least 15 years. At the same time, it’s rejecting fewer medications.

"Says Sen. Sherrod Brown admitted that his $787 billion stimulus law failed and after specifically attacking Republicans for wanting to lower Americans taxes, (he) now claims that his stimulus bill didnt do enough to lower taxes."	3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.
"In the 1950s, ""A lot of people got rich and they had to pay a top tax rate of 90 percent."""	Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.
"The Charleston, S.C., shootershould have never been given a gun, but the universal background check was not fast enough."	President Donald Trump is not responsible for the killing of journalists in Annapolis last week. His belittling of the press — his “enemy of the American people” taunts, his promises to roll back libel laws, his fomenting rage toward specific journalists at rallies — is worth mentioning within the context of the murders, because it speaks to a larger concern that last Thursday’s attack on The Capital Gazette won’t be an isolated incident. Journalists, many of whom already risk their lives covering war and violence, many of whom receive death threats regularly, feel understandable jitters about a leader who tries to turn the American public against us, particularly when we watch a member of that public shoot up a newsroom and end five lives. It’s reckless and inaccurate, though, to pin the shootings on Trump. The suspect swore an oath to kill a Capital writer who wrote about him in 2011.
Sixty-five percent of the Iraqi people now say it's okay to shoot an American soldier.	“They’ve twisted American values,” she said in a follow-up phone interview. “A lot of them are anti-God, anti-religion and anti-military.”
In the survey, most say they are proud to be Americans, although Republicans feel that way more strongly (90 percent) than Democrats (61 percent). There is no consensus when asked about the country’s current course, though: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. “Overwhelming majorities of those in both parties and independents agree that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.”” USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll

Says Gov. Chris Christies proposal to reduce state income taxes would be the second tax cut for the rich by the governor in two years.	Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.

Says George LeMieux was one of two Republicans who voted for President Barack Obamas jobs bill.	In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners. Alas, he is wasting his time trying to shift the views of the Democratic Party, which has become ever more left-wing, if not outright socialist. I think it is time for Mr. James to become a Republican. Guy Randolph

It’s shocking that Mr. James is surprised by the positive economic results of less regulation and lower taxes.
A precinct in the Allen West-Patrick Murphy recount has 7 registered voters in Guatemalan community and the tally showed 900 voted!!!!!	"The president of the republic and his government will be absolutely respectful and support the authorities that are elected," Pena Nieto told reporters. Hovering over the election is the specter of vote fraud, though electoral officials deny it is a possibility with the modern balloting technology and institutions now in place. In both of Lopez Obrador's previous two presidential losses he alleged fraud. In his first loss — by a mere 0.56 percent to conservative Felipe Calderon in 2006 — his supporters held months-long protests in Mexico City and he referred to himself as "the legitimate president." His allies are warning even before Sunday's presidential vote that there better not be any funny business.
"About 230,000 people that were on unemployment when I took office are not on unemployment now."	Pentagon Questioned Over Blackout On War Zone Troop Numbers
Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images
For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.

Local law enforcement . . . will have access to the [Obamacare] Data Hubs treasure trove of personal info.	"It's not a unique business," Troia said. "In this case, they just got caught with the door open." Two days after news of that leak broke, a data breach at the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training at Texas State University exposed the personal information of thousands of law enforcement officers. In that case, which was first reported by ZDNet, the personal info was stored on an unsecured web server, a university spokesman told CNNMoney. Data breaches can happen to anyone, of course -- just ask Equifax (EFX), which experienced a hack that exposed the personal information of over 147 million people last fall.
"During his tenure as mayor, he saw Houstons crime rates drop to the lowest levels in more than 25 years."	The first, Antonio Halili, was the mayor of the much larger Tanauan City, south of Manila. Unlike Bote, Halili had developed both a reputation for having a heavy hand against drug traffickers and negotiating with them. Halili appeared on a more recent Duterte list of elected officials with ties to drug trafficking in 2017. Shortly after Halili’s assassination, Duterte told reporters, “I don’t know who killed him, but I told you don’t [engage in illegal drugs]. … His procession of drug suspects was just a front.”
Prior to this accusation, however, Halili had established a “walk of shame” program where he paraded drug suspects around his city for the public to jeer, leading others in the government to suggest he was killed by drug traffickers in revenge for humiliating their peers.
Barack Obamas Columbia University ID says he was a foreign student and went by Barry Soetoro.	The president told Fox News that he believes his nominee will get some support from Democrats. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, an abortion rights supporter, is considered one of the key votes on a nominee. She said she wouldn't vote for someone who would overturn Roe v. Wade. "A candidate who would overturn Roe would not be acceptable," she said Sunday on ABC's This Week. Collins, who has previously bucked party lines on other key issues such as health care, said she plans to have an in-depth conversation with the nominee.
"John McCain, ""one of the richest people in a Senate filled with millionaires,"" says the solution to the housing crisis is for people to get a ""second job"" and ""skip their vacations."""	The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.

We look at other parts of the world, where women are not allowed to vote, or dance, and we see ourselves as modern and liberated.

In many of the areas to which we turn when we measure gender equality, we have not moved forward for the past 10 years – income, political engagement, education.
Says federal law enforcement officers cut off questioning of the Christmas Day underwear bomber by giving him a Miranda warning after 30 minutes of questioning.	But he said Pitts's extensive conversations with the undercover FBI employee, combined with a criminal record that included charges for assault, domestic violence and carrying a concealed weapon, gave agents cause for concern. He said the FBI arrested Pitts after he met with the undercover employee for a final time Sunday. "We don't have the luxury of hoping that an individual decides not to harm someone or get others to act, especially when his continued repeated intentions were to do just that," Anthony said.

In Kocho alone, at least 500 men and boys were killed, and 800 women and girls taken away. The group has documented at least 54 mass graves of Yazidis, but says a lack of resources has delayed the exhumation of the remains, and that there may be more graves yet to be discovered. Over the past three years, Syrian and Iraqi forces have gradually driven IS out of nearly all the territory it once held.

The basic deal is well understood by policymakers in both countries, with U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly emphasizing his great personal relationship with the Saudi king and crown prince.

Fillmore launched his career in the 1820s with the Anti-Masonic Party, hawking a paranoid rumour that ruling Freemasons were murdering whistleblowers.

In phase two, Trump says he will target $200bn of Chinese goods and is threatening to put a 20% duty on automotive imports from Europe. Both will inevitably provoke tit-for-tat retaliation. The White House has already signalled what phase three of the programme will involve: new investment restrictions on Chinese firms in an attempt to stop intellectual property theft; and the US leaving the World Trade Organisation on the grounds that the Geneva-based body was designed by the rest of the world to screw America.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections.

Crimes such as robbery remain rampant across Venezuela amid the country’s dire economic and humanitarian crisis, leading growing numbers of people to turn to violence merely to ensure survival. Kidnappings, armed robberies, and violent attacks are now commonplace. Venezuela is widely considered one of the most dangerous destinations in the world. As noted by El Nacional, “There are many travelers who have been stripped of money, luggage, and vehicles on the Caracas-La Guaira highway, especially at night and early morning when the road is little traveled and lacks surveillance.”
The doctors were present in Venezuela as part of an agreement between the two countries. Venezuela typically pays for the doctors in vast quantities of oil, an initiative that started under Hugo Chávez and Fidel Castro.

On this much police and activist South Side priest Michael Pfleger can agree: Saturday morning’s anti-violence march on the Dan Ryan Expressway is all about danger. Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.

Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.

"If you put the $47 billion in revenue (raised over 10 years by the Buffett rule) into infrastructure you could create 611,000 infrastructure jobs."	That will allow Trump to argue that his tough approach to trade is paying off. There are reasons why the US economy is currently strong, but none of them have anything to do with tariffs on imports. In part, it is the lagged effect of a buoyant global economy in 2017; in part it is explained by tax cuts and the stimulus still being provided by only gently rising interest rates. Mickey Levy, chief US economist for Berenberg, says Trump’s deregulation agenda has been a factor in boosting America’s underlying growth rate.

I have repeatedly said that many of the predatory loans that were made in the mortgage system did target African-American and Latino communities.	Daniel Egan tells inquiry that it was obvious everybody needed to get out, not stay put
The inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire has heard that a senior firefighter who arrived at the blaze just before 2am thought the residents should have been evacuated long before they were. During testimonies that made clear a lack of communication between firefighters, the inquiry heard how Daniel Egan, a senior fire safety officer with the London fire brigade arrived at the fire at 1.58am and immediately thought “we need to get people out of the building.”
“It looked like a film, people were shouting and screaming, they were panicking and wanting people to help,” he said. “My first thoughts were that we needed to get everybody out. I could hear the roar of the tower. It was obvious … you could hear people screaming … it was just so obvious, sorry.”
The “stay put” policy wasn’t abandoned until 2.47am, after which residents calling 999 who had been told to stay in their flats were told to try and evacuate.
"Starting in December 2007, 1.4 million jobs were created in Texas. In that same period, the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs."	The economy has added an average 207,000 jobs a month this year after a blowout number of 223,000 in May. Economists predict that 195,000 jobs were added in June. Unemployment stands at 3.8%, the lowest rate since 2000. If it dips to 3.7%, it will be the lowest since 1969.

An IPO market that was left for dead just two years ago has come roaring back in 2018, with companies raising public capital at a pace rarely seen in the past two decades. So far this year, 120 companies have used initial public offerings to raise $35.2 billion on U.S. exchanges. That is the highest volume since 2012 and the fourth-busiest year-to-date on record, according to Dealogic, whose data go back to 1995.
"The CBO, the Congressional Budget Office has said that Obamacare will kill 800,000 jobs."	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
"Thompson ""voted against $250,000 caps on damages (and) almost anything that would make our legal system fairer."""	The term might provide only “a very, very modest preview” of waves of conservative rulings to come, however, because a locked-down conservative majority would likely inspire rightwing activists to bring increasingly aggressive cases, said Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. “It’s not just that justice Kennedy’s successor is likely going to move the court to the right,” Vladeck said. “It’s that knowing that there are five conservative justices surely emboldens states and conservative interest groups to bring to the supreme court legal theories that they might have been reluctant to leave in justice Kennedy’s hands.”

If that picture of the country’s jurisprudential future has left liberals distraught, it has also raised questions about the court’s increasingly politicized nature, its power to shape society and the erosion of its independence as one branch of government meant to balance the other two – Congress and the presidency – and to be checked in turn itself. While past courts have had liberal or conservative bents, since the Bush v Gore decision that decided the 2000 election, the court has taken on a more explicitly political feel. “People say the founders would roll over in their graves – I think the founders would hang themselves”, said Mickey Edwards, vice-president of the Aspen Institute think-tank and formerly a congressman for 16 years.

On using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.	Its Clair Ridge development is expected to come on-stream later this year. Wood Mackenzie says Clair South, with around 300 million barrels of reserves, could be given the $2.2bn investment green light around 2021. So production would peak around 2027. It looks much less attractive to global players.
Immigrants are more fertile.	Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.
"The proposed education changes ""will not cut one teacher's pay."""	Hamilton, the Republican state lawmaker who beat the incumbent Karnes, won with a mix of support from teachers and other unions. While Karnes sparred with teachers during the strike, Hamilton took a moderate position. He aligned with teachers unions by opposing state right-to-work legislation and the proposed repeal of prevailing wage laws for public construction projects. The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Fred Knapp/NET News Fred Knapp/NET News
Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.

Upwards of 90 percent of women seeking an abortion decide not to have an abortion after seeing an ultrasound.	Despite decades of UN and government aid, 38% of the population lived in extreme poverty. Social workers proposed new a new approach. Puente al Desarrollo – A Bridge to Development – is human rights-based legislation that has seen government agencies and communities coming together to address social problems – and support people in meeting their aspirations. The new law applies a social work approach of responding to all the issues that contribute to poverty and strengthening community systems of self-care. Cristian Rodríguez Barrantes, a social worker on a drug-smuggling route in the Costa Rican slums, describes how the law works in practice.
We spend less on defense today as % of GDP than at any time since Pearl Harbor.	Abbott said on Tuesday night he never conceived of climate change as a moral challenge. “It was an issue, that’s all, and – at least on the actual changes we’ve so far seen – not a very significant one compared to man’s inhumanity to man; maintaining and improving living standards; and even to many other environmental issues such as degraded bush and waterways, particulate pollution, water quality in the third world, deforestation and urban overcrowding.”
He contended that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide from roughly 300 to 400 parts per million over the last century had not triggered “dramatic consequences”. Play Video 0:32 Andrew Probyn calls Tony Abbott 'destructive' in ABC report – video
“Storms are not more severe; droughts are not more prolonged; floods are not greater; and fires are not more intense than a century ago – despite hyperventilating reportage and over-the-top claims from Green politicians,” he said. “Sea levels have hardly risen and temperatures are still below those of the medieval warm period.

If you got rid of the income tax today you'd have about as much revenue as we had 10 years ago.	The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.
"Says Scott Walker wants to ban common forms of birth control, including the pill."	Bevin's administration announced the cuts after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Friday rejected Bevin's sweeping plan to overhaul the state's Medicaid program. The plan would have eliminated dental and vision benefits for such individuals, although they could earn points toward purchasing such services with a "My Rewards" account through activities such as volunteering or taking online classes. In a statement released Sunday, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services described the cuts "as an unfortunate consequence of the judge's ruling." "It's coming across as hostage-taking" said Dustin Pugel, a policy analyst with the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy in Berea.

"Shelby County donated Im sorry, gave 44 schools to the city of Memphis."	He aligned himself with most of his Democratic colleagues against Gina Haspel, Trump's pick for CIA director, arguing that her record on enhanced interrogation techniques was unacceptable. And instead of focusing on a politically safe issue in his maiden Senate floor speech, Jones struck a nerve by calling for a dialogue on gun violence after the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida. In addition, during the campaign, Jones made no secret of his desire to protect LGBTQ rights and to support a woman's right to abortion. It's those kinds of positions that have made him a darling of Alabama's progressive minority — and somewhat of a public enemy among the state's conservative majority. Jones has introduced four pieces of legislation — none of any huge significance — since he arrived on Capitol Hill, including two agriculture bills, one that would expand access to capital for rural job creators and the last seeking to mandate an annual Medicaid expansion review.
"Top U.S. intelligence officials have toldevery member of Congress, including the president, were about to be attacked in a serious way because (of) the threat emanating from Syria and Iraq."	President Trump has just said in the past week he's going to raise things like Syria, like Ukraine, like the election meddling issue, really the whole range of issues between us. And I think that, in the president's mind, this is very important, because it gives him an opportunity to size up Vladimir Putin, to see where there are areas where we might make progress together and where there are areas where we may not. BRENNAN: Well, right now, Russia is blanket-bombing Southern Syria. That violates the last agreement Vladimir Putin made with President Trump. Why would he believe that he's in any way trustworthy?
Have the suburbs been inundated with former residents of Atlanta housing projects? Absolutely not.	Having started out with a higher than average unemployment rate, Telford has since witnessed the arrival of major American, European and Japanese businesses: notably Hitachi, Denso, Maxell and Ricoh. Together they brought in thousands of high-technology jobs while the neighbouring Birmingham and Black Country conurbation was still rooted predominantly in traditional metal-based industries. Equally, there is no disguising the scale of the challenges the town has faced along the way. Sixteen years ago, the Commons select committee for transport, local government and the regions reported on new towns in general, but this could could easily have been about Telford in particular:
"While many new towns have been economically successful, most are now experiencing major problems. Their design is inappropriate for the 21st century.

The government is going to have the right to get into your bank account with the health care bill and make transfers without you knowing it.	She stood successfully as an SNP candidate for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley just two years ago, after becoming a prominent advocate for women’s voices in the 2014 campaign for independence. Last week, in a sweeping cabinet reshuffle, Nicola Sturgeon asked Freeman to be her health secretary – a portfolio the first minister herself held for five years under Alex Salmond – after Shona Robison resigned following mounting pressure from opposition parties over the performance of NHS Scotland. It is one of the most difficult briefs in Holyrood as the service faces significant funding and recruitment problems. Of the challenge, Freeman says: “I have a personal and family background in the health service, and I have nothing but admiration for every person who works in our NHS whatever their job is. There have always been challenges and demands on the NHS and that will continue.
There are mechanisms in place to shut down the Internet privately.	China Mobile has reportedly been censoring content banned by the Chinese government’s “great firewall,” even when Chinese citizens are in the United States — prompting the FCC to debate its license. According to the Washington Post, on Monday, the U.S. Department of Commerce “recommended the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) deny a license to China Mobile, the state-run company that is the world’s largest phone network by subscribers.”
“The Commerce Department suggested the move because of the national security risk China Mobile poses,” they explained, adding that China Mobile is an “arm of the Chinese state,” and that “those with China Mobile as their carrier are often unable to access American websites and apps that are banned in China.”
One Chinese journalist was reportedly unable to access Facebook, the New York Times, and Google Maps from their phone while in the United States. Another user, Shanghai analyst May Sun, warned that the “Great Firewall” doesn’t stop when you enter the United States as a Chinese citizen. “[It] is exactly the same as when you surf on the Internet at home,” May Sun declared. “You still don’t have access to what is blocked by the Great Firewall.”
In a statement, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) called China Mobile an “unacceptable risk.”
“Granting the authorization poses an unacceptable risk to U.S. national security and law enforcement,” NTIA proclaimed.
The American people support defunding Obamacare and oppose shutting down the government.	“They’ve twisted American values,” she said in a follow-up phone interview. “A lot of them are anti-God, anti-religion and anti-military.”

Durbin’s advocacy for mass-migration and for younger ‘dreamer’ illegals has caused the Democrats much political pain. He pushed for the abortive budget-shutdown in January 2018, and for the “Gang of Eight” amnesty bill in 2013 which helped the Democrats lose nine seats in 2014. The Democrats’ top leader in the Senate, Sen. Chuck Schumer, is keeping his distance from the “Abolish ICE” campaign. He is instead using his Twitter account to tout Democrats’ promises on healthcare, guns, gay status, and claims that President Donald Trump is tied to Russian President Vladimir Putin. On the Abolish ICE campaign, Schumer is instead calling for a “czar” to focus media attention on “reunifying families.” That topic polls better for Democrats than ending immigration enforcement.

Republicans may not want to push the issue too far: “When pro-lifers accumulate enough justices to threaten Roe, they scare pro-choicers into voting on the issue.”
Oh please: Liberals are twisting themselves in knots to tie Anthony Kennedy’s retirement to Trumpian corruption, somehow. Mark Joseph Stern thinks it’s just not that complicated.

Their kids have just been kidnapped. How do you prepare for your [asylum case?] Carlos García, immigration lawyer,
On top of his private practice, García plans to visit Port Isabel a few times a week, which is an hour and a half drive from his office, to give migrants legal advice. He recently committed to fully representing a mother who has not spoken to her six-year-old child in three weeks. García says he’s tempted to take on more cases every time he visits the detention center, and he receives a few emails every day from other lawyers about someone else in need of an attorney.
"We went from losing 3 million jobs in the last six months of the Bush Administration, adding almost 600,000 private sector jobs in the first six months of the year."	While Blackstone Vice President Tony James offered some useful common-sense economic and political advice for Democrats, it was a bit of a head-scratcher to read his unsubstantiated declaration that “some of the current expansion is built on the foundation laid by the Obama administration.” Mr. James’s praise for the previous administration sounds a lot like the laughable claim by President Obama himself that America’s current economic vitality and growth are really due to the fact that he had the economy “set up well” for Mr. Trump. If by “set up well,” President Obama meant that the economy had been driven so far into the ground and smothered by excessive regulation and high taxes that almost anything that followed his antibusiness policies would be a success, then there would have been some merit in his claim. But does anyone think that’s what he’s saying?While Blackstone Vice President Tony James offered some useful common-sense economic and political advice for Democrats, it was a bit of a head-scratcher to read his unsubstantiated declaration that “some of the current expansion is built on the foundation laid by the Obama administration.” Mr. James’s praise for the previous administration sounds a lot like the laughable claim by President Obama himself that America’s current economic vitality and growth are really due to the fact that he had the economy “set up well” for Mr. Trump.While Blackstone Vice President Tony James offered some useful common-sense economic and political advice for Democrats, it was a bit of a head-scratcher to read his unsubstantiated declaration that “some of the current expansion is built on the foundation laid by the Obama administration.” Mr. James’s praise for the previous administration sounds a lot like the laughable claim by President Obama himself that America’s current economic vitality and growth are really due to the fact that he had the economy “set up well” for Mr. Trump.
The STAR Ohio fund just received the highest possible credit rating one of these funds can receive.	Tesla could use a lighter moment. It has had a 2018 filled with ups and downs. In May, Consumer Reports initially did not recommend the electric vehicle giant’s Model 3, its first car priced for mainstream buyers, in part because of long stopping distances, only to see the magazine relent after it flashed software to cars that improved them. Last month, Tesla topped a list of best-selling electric vehicles in the United States, selling three of the five most popular cars. And this week, Tesla announced that it had reached Musk's goal of manufacturing 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week.
"Taxpayers are on the hook ... for less than a third of the proposed new Atlanta Falcons stadium, and those funds are repaid from money that comes from outsiders."	The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives. At first there was talk about a much bigger pot of money -- $100 million or more. When the bill was reintroduced this year, the amount was $20 million. By the end of the legislative session, it was down to $5 million.
"In the last 22 months, businesses have created more than 3 million jobs. Last year, they created the most jobs since 2005."	The services sector, where most Americans are employed, has now expanded for 101 consecutive months, or more than eight years. The gain was better than many economists had been expecting and depicts an overall economy that appears to be regaining momentum after a slowdown in the winter.

At least 41 alleged injuries have been reported, but NHTSA has yet to publicly offer any answers. Now at the two-year anniversary of the investigation, safety advocates are expressing frustration over the limited information coming out of NHTSA, reports CBS News correspondent Kris Van Cleave.

The automaker claims it "effectively resolves" the problem. NHTSA has received almost 200 complaints about the issue.
The House of Representatives has never passed a resolution of disapproval to condemn a member's behavior.	But sex-worker-rights campaigners say the proposal would be "a disaster". Three organisations - the Sex Worker Advocacy and Resistance Movement (Swarm), the English Collective of Prostitutes (ECP), and the xTalk collective - are planning a demonstration outside Parliament at the time of this Wednesday's debate to protest against the suggested law change. They describe the idea as being a "Trump-inspired" effort to kick sex workers off the internet and put them into "more exploitative and harmful situations". New platforms
The debate follows an official report into sexual exploitation in England and Wales, which was published in May. It concluded that prostitution procurement websites were "the most significant enabler of sex-trafficking in the UK".
"We are younger than our competitors, and this is entirely because of immigration."	Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.
Recent international reports show the United States near the bottom among industrialized nations for k-12 academic achievement.	But that no-deportations policy would allow many companies to hire illegals instead of Americans. That subsequent rush of migrants would force down wages for Americans and for legal immigrants, force up rents and housing prices, and also overcrowd public K-12 schools. Polls show that no-deportations policy is radioactive among swing voters and ut congressional actions show it is quietly supported by many GOP and Democratic politicians . B
Trump’s campaign to limit legal and illegal immigration is driving up wages and salaries for Americans in various locations and careers around the country.

He described “unbelievably bad border laws, immigration laws” in the United States, calling them “the weakest in the world, laughed at by everybody in the world.” He contrasted the U.S. immigration laws with “Mexico’s very strong immigration laws.”
Trump suggested that Mexico can help the United States “until we straighten out our immigration laws, which have been bad for many, many years, decades.” He further assured, “We’re gonna have them taken care of.”

Eric Young, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees’ Council of Prison Locals, now prays before he looks at his phone every morning, worried he’ll receive a message from BOP’s director notifying him of a staff death. Young estimates that around two-thirds of his union members were Trump supporters. That makes sense: It’s a law enforcement agency that leans white and male (72 percent male, 62 percent white), and many federal prisons are in rural parts of the country, which Trump dominated. But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau. BOP has long suffered the kind of problems you’d expect for a massive bureaucracy centered on caging tens of thousands of people.

They are even now talking about two other former Kennedy clerks for the Supreme Court, Judges Brett Kavanaugh and Ray Kethledge. And they've put a bunch of Kennedy clerks onto the lower courts.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
"Says the CBO estimates that fully extending the Bush tax cuts would add 600,000-1.4 million jobs in 2011 and 900,000-2.7 million jobs in 2012."

Unemployment stands at 3.8%, the lowest rate since 2000. If it dips to 3.7%, it will be the lowest since 1969.

The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.
"Most young Americans right now, theyre not covered by health insurance."	But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said. Tackett said he's concerned about children, especially in Eastern Kentucky, which has a higher rate of Medicaid patients and some of the state's worst oral health. "I have no problem with them regulating the adults that are on Medicaid," Tackett said. "If they are young and healthy, they should be out working or doing something.

"In the class of 1968 at Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, Mahmoud Abbas was one of the members of that class, and so was Ali Khamenei. And thats where they first established relationships with the young Vladimir Putin."	President Trump has just said in the past week he's going to raise things like Syria, like Ukraine, like the election meddling issue, really the whole range of issues between us. And I think that, in the president's mind, this is very important, because it gives him an opportunity to size up Vladimir Putin, to see where there are areas where we might make progress together and where there are areas where we may not. BRENNAN: Well, right now, Russia is blanket-bombing Southern Syria. That violates the last agreement Vladimir Putin made with President Trump. Why would he believe that he's in any way trustworthy?

Over the fireplace at Mingo Creek Craft Distillers, a whiskey purveyor in the small town of Washington, Pennsylvania, a portrait of Alexander Hamilton hangs upside down. With snowy hair and a black velvet jacket, Hamilton wears an impassive look that might be described as hauteur. In 1791, to pay off debts the newly formed United States incurred during the revolutionary war, Hamilton imposed the first federal tax on the people of the region. By taxing their most lucrative product, whiskey, he became what he is here today: a villain representing the excesses of the federal government. The town of Washington is only a six-hour drive from Manhattan, but it’s a world away from the Broadway stage where Hamilton, clad in snug white knickers, enjoys a better reputation.
"As a U.S. senator with salary and perks, ‪#Bernie‬ is in the top 1 percent, but still paid only 13 percent in taxes last year."	Hamilton, the Republican state lawmaker who beat the incumbent Karnes, won with a mix of support from teachers and other unions. While Karnes sparred with teachers during the strike, Hamilton took a moderate position.

The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.
"You know we can't just pull out now... The truth of the matter is: If we started today, it would take one year, one year to get 160,000 troops physically out of Iraq, logistically."	Pentagon Questioned Over Blackout On War Zone Troop Numbers

For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.
"From 2013-2015, the richest 14 Americans increased their net wealth by more than $157 billion, yet the Republican budget would not require these Americans to contribute one penny to deficit reduction."	I also thought that liberals chose more regulation and higher taxes despite this cause-and-effect relationship. Now I discover that they don’t even understand it. While Blackstone Vice President Tony James offered some useful common-sense economic and political advice for Democrats, it was a bit of a head-scratcher to read his unsubstantiated declaration that “some of the current expansion is built on the foundation laid by the Obama administration.” Mr. James’s praise for the previous administration sounds a lot like the laughable claim by President Obama himself that America’s current economic vitality and growth are really due to the fact that he had the economy “set up well” for Mr. Trump.

"Says that while Foster was mayor, Rick Kriseman was ineffective in the Florida House of Representatives because there was no legislation that passed the House that had (Krisemans) name on it."	A California city official sparked outrage this weekend after calling for July to be designated “Straight Pride American Month” in an essay that appeared in a local newspaper and on his personal website. The June 29 installment of Dixon Vice Mayor Ted Hickman’s column, “That’s Life,” contained a number of slurs against LGBTQ people and other eyebrow-raising language. Blasting June as “LGBTQF-WTF month,” Hickman suggested “Straight Pride American Month,” or “SPAM,” as a time for “healthy, heterosexual, fairly monogamous, keep our kinky stuff to ourselves Americans” to be celebrated nationwide. “Don’t get me wrong I support the First Amendment, as much as the next person, and support the rights of grown men to wear skin tight short-shorts and go-go boots and don tinker bell wings with wand and prance down the streets of San Francisco,” Hickman wrote. Ted Hickman should be ashamed for sharing such an awful message... Dixon, CA needs to do better.
Says Texas routinely gets a lot more federal spending than it pays in taxes.	That came on the heels of 0.9 percent drop in March, the first monthly drop since July of 2017. Total private construction rose 0.3 percent, with residential projects up 0.8 percent in May. New single-family home construction rose 0.6 percent and the volatile apartment building sector jumped 1.6 percent. Private, non-residential building fell 0.3 percent. Economists are forecasting that construction spending will contribute to overall growth this year even though interest rates are rising.
Cell phone numbers go public this month.	"It's not a unique business," Troia said. "In this case, they just got caught with the door open." Two days after news of that leak broke, a data breach at the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training at Texas State University exposed the personal information of thousands of law enforcement officers. In that case, which was first reported by ZDNet, the personal info was stored on an unsecured web server, a university spokesman told CNNMoney. Data breaches can happen to anyone, of course -- just ask Equifax (EFX), which experienced a hack that exposed the personal information of over 147 million people last fall.

Clackamas County Commissioners approved a re-negotiated agreement to lower the countys contribution to TriMets Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail project to $19.9 million from $25 million.	They include the United States withdrawing its 28,500 troops in South Korea, ending its military drills with South Korea and stop bringing in strategic assets such as aircraft carriers and nuclear-capable bombers. North Korea hasn't repeated such specific demands since entering disarmament talks earlier this year, raising optimism that the country truly appeared to seek to improve ties with the United States. After the summit, Trump suspended annual military training with South Korea that the North has called an invasion rehearsal. But North Korea still prefers a step-by-step disarmament process with reciprocal concessions and benefits from the United States for each of the North's denuclearization steps. The ultimate rewards North Korea wants range from the easing or lifting of American-led international sanctions, the signing of a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, the establishment of diplomatic ties and the pulling out of U.S. troops in South Korea, experts say.
Says Texas has 11 different felonies you can commit with an oyster.	Full-service restaurants with more elaborate menus and more complex processes, like the Red Hen and those in The Trump Organization properties, are more vulnerable to violations than fast-food eateries with limited food offerings and a streamlined kitchen production line, said Craig Hedberg, a professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Minnesota. And those with repeated violations can get into even more trouble with their local health departments, said Hedberg. Those eateries will be flagged by inspectors, who bring copies of previous reports on their visits and can spot patterns of regulation flouting. How repeat offenses are handled differs by jurisdiction. “It’s very rare to see a perfect score,” he said.

"Electric car sales in Georgia have dropped dramatically since a $5,000 tax credit was eliminated and a $200 annual registration fee was imposed July 1."	Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.

As a safe blue state, Rhode Island rarely gets any national political attention. But Walsh woke up Tuesday to donations from as far away as Texas and California. Party officials describe Earnheart as a "lifelong Democrat" who voted for Trump because he didn’t like Hillary Clinton.

As many as six federal department budget bills have been delayed because of opposition to amendments that would ban Confederate battle flag sales at federal building gift shops.	"Unlike our forerunners in 1968, those of us living today have access to something they didn't," said Mary Eberstadt, a widely published Catholic writer, "50 years of sociological, psychological, medical, and other evidence about the revolution's fallout." Some of the lines in Humanae Vitae, when stripped of mid-20th century cultural references, find echoes in contemporary concerns about nonconsensual sexual relations. "A man who grows accustomed to the use of contraceptive methods may forget the reverence due to a woman," the pope wrote, "... and reduce her to a mere instrument of his own desires." "This document that has been so controversial and in many places reviled," Eberstadt says, "actually called the shots on what the future would look like better than any other single source I could think of." Revisionist views of the 1968 encyclical have even taken hold among some Catholics who have not abided by its teaching.

He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.
"Now, in the House of Representatives, we have 40 different jobs bills that have passed and almost all of them have been bipartisan."	“They’ve twisted American values,” she said in a follow-up phone interview. “A lot of them are anti-God, anti-religion and anti-military.”
In the survey, most say they are proud to be Americans, although Republicans feel that way more strongly (90 percent) than Democrats (61 percent). There is no consensus when asked about the country’s current course, though: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. “Overwhelming majorities of those in both parties and independents agree that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.”” USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll

"Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas said: Hey, all you wrinkly, white-aged has-beens: Its time for you to die and let the next generation have your spot on the planet."	In addition, a group of incumbent Democrats – including U.S. Rep. Brian Higgins of New York and Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania – say they won’t back Pelosi for another term as party leader. "Our leadership is out of touch with what is going on, not only in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan but in Cheektowaga, West Seneca, Hamburg, Orchard Park and Lancaster," Higgins told the Buffalo News, referring to swing states that voted for Donald Trump in 2016, as well as municipalities near Buffalo. "Our leadership is out of touch with what is going on ... in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan ... " - U.S. Rep. Brian Higgins, D-N.Y.
Perhaps the biggest blow to Pelosi’s future prospects occurred last Tuesday in New York City, when 28-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeated longtime U.S. Rep. Joseph Crowley, 56, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. To many political watchers, it suggested that Democratic voters have grown tired of the party’s old guard and want a new generation of leaders. But Pelosi quickly dismissed Ocasio-Cortez’s upset victory as a “one district” fluke – a comment that may serve only to further inspire the younger, more far-left candidates seeking to move on Pelosi and her contemporaries."Our leadership is out of touch with what is going on ... in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan ... " - U.S. Rep. Brian Higgins, D-N.Y.

"Republican (small business tax cut) bill spends $80 million for better Google searches, not job creation"	In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions.

The report says the combined value of metallurgical and thermal coal exports will be $60.2bn in 2017-18, behind iron ore at $61.8bn. It says coal exports will be slightly lower at $58.1bn in 2018-19, and that iron ore earnings will be even lower at $57.7bn, as falling iron ore prices drive export earnings lower. The Australian characterised that event as coal reclaiming its mantle as the nation’s “top export earner”. But the report says coal export earnings will soon drop below those for iron ore again, as global coal prices fall. India's huge solar ambitions could push coal further into shade Read more
In 2019-20 coal export earnings will be just $51.1bn, while iron ore earnings will be $55.4bn.
America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world.	She worried that giving birth to this child would leave her so tainted that no man would ever want her as his wife. In a panic, she told her mother, who swiftly took her to a clinic for an abortion. But A was so frightened by the doctor's description of possible side effects that she thought she would die. And so she retreated to her shelter, where she tried to flatten her growing belly by wrapping it in tight layers of scarves. She hid there for months, emerging only to use the latrine a few meters away.
"If black America were a country, itd be the 15th wealthiest nation in the world."	On the Fourth of July, 1852, America celebrated its freedom, as it does every Independence Day. Frederick Douglass, America’s most famous anti-slavery activist and fugitive slave, saw no ground to celebrate: he saw the octopus arms of slavery stretched everywhere, exposing the hollowness of America’s freedom values. That holiday, he delivered the greatest antislavery speech in American history. Not least since the racism that made slavery endures.

For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.

"But we're not ultimately the ones responsible when an individual decides to take the act of using a firearm or other weapon to take another life.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
"Americans, in the last 30 years, have more than doubled the amount of money we are spending per child (on education) and the results have gotten worse, not better."	“Regardless of political parties, we need people to make a decision about what’s happening in the classroom,” said Marisol Garcia, vice president of the Arizona Education Association. “To limit ourselves and to say ‘only these people are going to support us’ is just not true.”
Teachers can be at a disadvantage compared to wealthier candidates, who tend to have built-in networks of potential donors. The NEA’s Eskelsen Garcia experienced that firsthand when she ran for Congress in Utah in 1998, recalling mystified looks and wary questions from people trying to figure out who was bankrolling her (she lost to the Republican nominee in the general election). But teachers, especially experienced ones, can benefit from their network of former students and their real-life connection to middle-class voters. “As a teacher married to a teacher, I know what it’s like to work paycheck to paycheck,” said Tom Niermann, a teacher running to unseat Rep. Kevin Yoder (R-Kan.) in suburban Kansas City.
Polls show that Floridians dont want to repeal the Affordable Care Act.	The vast majority of swing voters across the United States oppose the Democrats’ latest plan to abolish all immigration enforcement by ending the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. In recent weeks, Democrats in the House and Senate, along with progressive liberals like Cynthia Nixon in New York and most recently insurgent Democrat candidate for Congress, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have been demanding ICE be abolished and all immigration enforcement be ended. House Democrats are now crafting legislation that would officially abolish ICE. The latest Harvard/Harris Poll, though, reveals that swing voters are overwhelmingly opposed to the Democrats’ plan to end all immigration enforcement across the U.S.
Nearly 3-in-4 swing voters, about 73 percent, of swing voters said they do not want ICE to be disbanded. Less than 30 percent of swing voters said they support the abolishment of ICE.

Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.

On offshore drilling for energy	But, unlike the wind industry which has settled on a three-blade design, underwater designers are also testing four and six-bladed versions too. OpenHydro, already deployed in Canada’s Bay of Fundy, use giant 16m hoops with inward-pointing blades that resemble the mouth of a giant lamprey fish. Its makers opened the world’s first tidal turbine manufacturing plant in Cherbourg last week. There are also vertical turbines that spin like a fairground carousel, such as Hydroquest in France and LHD in China, and one company is even making an undulating membrane inspired by swimming fish. Capturing wave power is even more challenging than tapping the tides – “survivability” is the key term in this sector.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday he thinks the federal government can’t do much to help stop school shootings. “I don’t think at the federal level there’s much that we can do other than appropriate funds,” McConnell said while speaking to community leaders in Danville, Kentucky, the Lexington Herald-Leader reports. McConnell said he feels heightened security in schools may help prevent shootings but argued that’s not the responsibility of the U.S. Congress. “You would think, given how much it takes to get on an American plane or given how much it takes to get into courthouses, that this might be something that we could achieve, but I don’t think we could do that from Washington, I think it’s basically a local decision,” he said. “It’s a darn shame that’s where we are, but this epidemic is something that’s got all of our attention,” he added.

Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey.

Norway says the number of asylum seekers from Turkey has increased noticeably in recent weeks, and officials say it will take time to process them because Oslo needs to check other countries' practices in similar cases. Frode Forfang, head of Norway's Directorate of Immigration, says many have claimed political persecution at home because of links to U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who is blamed by Turkey for the 2016 failed coup. The agency said that 245 Turkish nationals have sought shelter in Norway so far in 2018, including 142 arriving in June. That compares to a total of 164 Turkish nationals who sought asylum in Norway in 2017. The agency offered no explanation for the June increase.

"Says although the unemployment rate seems to be improving, it does not reflect real job creation -- its caused by a shrinking of the actual labor force."	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services sector activity picked up in June amid strong growth in new orders, but trade tariffs and a shortage of workers were starting to strain the supply chain, which could slow momentum in the coming months.

While other data on Thursday showed private payrolls rising less than expected last month and a surprise increase in new applications for unemployment benefits last week, overall labor market conditions continue to tighten. The labor market is considered to be near or at full employment, with the jobless rate at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent. The unemployment rate has dropped by three-tenths of a percentage point this year and is near the Federal Reserve’s forecast of 3.6 percent by the end of this year.

Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey.

"Obama voted ""to cut off funding for our American troops on the battlefield."""	Pentagon Questioned Over Blackout On War Zone Troop Numbers
Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images
For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.

In one case, Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion that illegal immigrants do not have the same bargaining rights as American citizens and legal workers. “… an illegal immigrant worker is not an ’employee’ under the NLRA for the simple reason that, ever since 1986, an illegal immigrant worker is not a lawful ’employee’ in the United States,” Kavanaugh wrote. In another case, Kavanaugh noted that American multi-national corporations do not have the right to import foreign workers. The Circuit judge explained, “Under the provision of the immigration laws at issue here, mere economic expediency does not authorize an employer to displace American workers for foreign workers.”
Prominent conservative Ann Coulter has also called for Trump to nominate Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, arguing that other judges such as Thomas Hardiman and Raymond Kethledge “are open borders zealots.”

The home secretary said he was "comfortable" the "exact same nerve agent" had been used in both the Salisbury and Amesbury poisonings - but added it was not yet known if they were from the same batch. In response to Mr Javid's comments, Russia said the British government was subjecting them "to hell". Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova urged police not to be led by the "dirty political game" and said she was confident London would have to apologise to Russia.
Democrats are kind of falling over each other seeing who can raise taxes faster. It looks like they're going to raise taxes anywhere between 20 to 30 percent.	And then you have the old guard, like Pelosi and others at the top. And there is no overall messaging that is bringing that all together. That's why these arguments like abolish ICE start catching fire, because there's no other counter message out there from the Democrats--

The services sector, where most Americans are employed, has now expanded for 101 consecutive months, or more than eight years. The gain was better than many economists had been expecting and depicts an overall economy that appears to be regaining momentum after a slowdown in the winter.

"Unlike our forerunners in 1968, those of us living today have access to something they didn't," said Mary Eberstadt, a widely published Catholic writer, "50 years of sociological, psychological, medical, and other evidence about the revolution's fallout." Some of the lines in Humanae Vitae, when stripped of mid-20th century cultural references, find echoes in contemporary concerns about nonconsensual sexual relations. "A man who grows accustomed to the use of contraceptive methods may forget the reverence due to a woman," the pope wrote, "... and reduce her to a mere instrument of his own desires." "This document that has been so controversial and in many places reviled," Eberstadt says, "actually called the shots on what the future would look like better than any other single source I could think of." Revisionist views of the 1968 encyclical have even taken hold among some Catholics who have not abided by its teaching.
"Before our last three presidents, you have to go back to the 1800s, early 1800s to find three presidents in a row being consecutively re-elected."	It's difficult to imagine Old Hickory, as he was known, excusing himself from military duty on the grounds that he could not march long distances, as Mr Trump did during the Vietnam War, citing bone spurs. The parallels between the 45th president and the 13th - unlucky for some - are arguably more compelling. Fillmore launched his career in the 1820s with the Anti-Masonic Party, hawking a paranoid rumour that ruling Freemasons were murdering whistleblowers. Mr Trump paved the way for his White House bid by peddling a conspiracy theory, too - that President Barack Obama was not a US citizen.

And they warn that the escalating trade war will slow global growth and jeopardize the second-longest economic expansion in U.S. history.

The NHS will consume 66% of the Welsh budget by 2048 if demand increases in line with predicted demand, according to new research. Health economist Prof Ceri Phillips said spending on the NHS would need to rise by 4% a year. Currently £6bn out of a total Welsh budget of £14.5bn goes to the NHS. The Welsh Government said its Health and Social Care Plan aimed to reduce demand through more people managing their own health and well-being. BBC Wales Investigates had asked Prof Phillips, from Swansea University, to question existing projections for healthcare in Wales and then calculate how much extra spending would be needed to keep the NHS afloat.

The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”

Amnesty advocates rely on business-funded “Nation of Immigrants” push-polls to show apparent voter support for immigration and immigrants.

Companies and trade groups are trying to hire congressional staffers with ties to influential House Democrats four months ahead of the midterm elections, in which Democrats are expected to pick up seats and potentially retake control of the House. Lobbyists are helping their clients meet with the Democrats who would become committee chairs if the party does win back the chamber. And trade groups are talking to members about what to expect from a Democratic takeover.
We do not want to raise anybodys tax rates. Thats never been on the table.	3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.

"This is the first time a party has picked up multiple seats during a regular election since the mid 1980s, making this the largest majority of any party in more than 25 years."	"Peace and tranquility are the fruits of justice," Lopez Obrador said. Exit polling by Consulta Mitofsky for the Televisa network forecast gubernatorial wins for allies of Lopez Obrador's Morena party in at least four of eight state races on the ballot plus for the head of government in Mexico City. The central state of Guanajuato was expected to go to a candidate of the conservative National Action Party. Mitofsky predicted Morena allies would take between 56 and 70 seats in the 128-member Senate and between 256 and 291 spots in the 500-seat lower house. "The anger that the average Mexican feels toward the way things are being governed has favored Lopez Obrador," said Shannon O'Neil, senior fellow for Latin America Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.
John wasn't this raging populist four years ago when he ran for president.	It's difficult to imagine Old Hickory, as he was known, excusing himself from military duty on the grounds that he could not march long distances, as Mr Trump did during the Vietnam War, citing bone spurs. The parallels between the 45th president and the 13th - unlucky for some - are arguably more compelling. Fillmore launched his career in the 1820s with the Anti-Masonic Party, hawking a paranoid rumour that ruling Freemasons were murdering whistleblowers. Mr Trump paved the way for his White House bid by peddling a conspiracy theory, too - that President Barack Obama was not a US citizen.

Fillmore later joined the Whig Party at a time of mounting hostility to refugees from famine, rebellion and tyranny who were arriving by the shipload at the gates of the New World.
House Republicans who complained they didnt have enough time to consider a constitutional ban against oil drilling shoved through a proposal in just a few days to open state waters to oil drilling.	The strategy reprises last year's successful approach to confirming Justice Neil Gorsuch in the early spring of 2017. Gorsuch was named to fill the vacancy left by the death of Antonin Scalia and then kept open by the refusal of the Senate's Republican majority to consider Merrick Garland, the replacement named by President Barack Obama in 2016. Gorsuch was greeted with delight by abortion opponents, even though he had not ruled directly on Roe in his judicial career. But his confirmation was far from a sure thing because two Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, were seen as defenders of abortion rights.

"Rather, the issuance of injunctive relief in this case serves only to hold Defendants accountable to their own governing policies and to ensure that Plaintiffs receive the protections they are due under the Parole Directive." The lawsuits was filed in March by legal groups representing nine jailed asylum-seekers. The plaintiffs include an ethics teacher from Haiti who was attacked after teaching his class about government corruption, a Venezuelan who was threatened for participating in marches opposing the country's communist government, and a gay Honduran man who was threatened at gunpoint. One has been held in U.S. custody for over two years.
Crime is rising.	The problem is so pervasive that a lawmaker recently asked El Salvador's Legislative Assembly for national identity cards to be issued without addresses "to save lives." Fifteen years ago, the Salvadoran government began a crackdown on gangs, resulting in thousands of members being imprisoned. Yet they continued to proliferate, even running operations with cell phones from behind bars. El Salvador's defense minister said in 2015 there were 60,000 gang members in the country, compared to a combined police and army strength of 50,000. Members of those security forces contribute to the violence that is causing the northward migration.

The bulk of the people who are shot with a weapon other than these drug gangs taking on one another end up being shot with their own weapon.	Five children 15 and younger were among 23 people shot during a scorching weekend in Chicago. From Friday afternoon to early Monday, 21 people were wounded and two people were killed, including a 14-year-old boy who was shot early Saturday while walking in the Washington Park neighborhood, according to police. About nine hours earlier, another 14-year-old boy was shot in the Loop. He was coming up stairs at the corner of Wabash Avenue and Wacker Drive when he was shot in the leg Friday evening, police said. Late Sunday night, three girls ages 5, 14 and 15 were shot while sitting in a parked car with their mother in the East Garfield Park neighborhood, police said.

Last month, Tesla topped a list of best-selling electric vehicles in the United States, selling three of the five most popular cars. And this week, Tesla announced that it had reached Musk's goal of manufacturing 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week.
Says Miami Congressman Carlos Curbelo supports drilling offshore and repeatedly voted against President Obamas ability to fight pollution and combat climate change.	Fox News again dominated for the second quarter of 2018 not only in cable news, but in all of cable, while CNN landed in last place by a country mile. For the eighth straight quarter, Fox was the most-watched network in all of cable. With an average of 1.409 million total day viewers, Fox attracted nearly as many eyeballs as MSNBC and CNN combined. MSNBC averaged just 930,000 viewers, while CNN nosedived with an average of just 658,000. During primetime, Fox snagged an average of 2.447 million viewers, compared to MSNBC’s 1.736 million.

Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. Federal prosecutors on Tuesday publicly debunked conspiracy theories pushed by President Donald Trump and right-wing media that a former Democratic aide charged with bank fraud was actually a foreign spy trying to steal government secrets. In a plea deal with Imran Awan, who worked as an information technology aide for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., and other Democratic lawmakers, prosecutors said they had conducted "a thorough investigation" into claims that Awan stole information from government servers on behalf of another country while working for House Democrats, but reported that they found no evidence to support the conspiracy theories. "The Government agrees that the public allegations that (Awan) stole U.S. House of Representatives equipment and engaged in unauthorized or illegal conduct involving House computer systems do not form the basis of any conduct relevant to the determination of the sentence in this case," prosecutors said.

But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.

Even Pruitt’s own staff had begun to sour on him, with many worrying that their future career prospects would be damaged by their association with Pruitt’s tenure. Each scandal seemed more damning than the last. Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.

"Under a bill before the legislature, youd have to go to court to fire an employee."	Trump’s chaos theory of running companies is now on full display in the West Wing, but it’s also on display in the rest of us. He’s the made himself the center of our universe, and most of us are now unwittingly circling his orbit. It’s time for every Trump critic in cyberspace to pause, take a deep breath (or five) and put the salesman-turned-president in proper perspective. The founders wanted a government of the people, but they never said we had to tweet at the president’s level. He’s merely today’s shiniest, (though ever-fading) object and in reality represents nothing new.
There is little if any evidence that the use of red light cameras in New Jersey has reduced the number or severity of accidents at the intersections where they are used.	There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void. In New Jersey, this is compounded by the fact that the state is located between two big cities, New York and Philadelphia, that are in other states. The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
"Says nearly 29,000 Oregonians almost 5 percent of all homeowners are 90 days or more delinquent on their mortgage."	Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.

Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.
George Allen and his colleagues in the Senate turned the biggest surplus in the history of the United States into the biggest deficit in the history of the United States.	The U.S. trade deficit dropped in May to the lowest level in 19 months as U.S. exports rose to a record level. But the trade gap between the United States and China increased sharply, underscoring the economic tensions between the world's two biggest economies. The Commerce Department says the May trade deficit — the difference between what America sells and what it buys in foreign markets — fell 6.6 percent to $43.1 billion. It was the smallest imbalance since October 2016. Exports climbed 1.9 percent to a record $215.3 billion.

Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino said those promoted had been "loyal to the constitutionally elected president". He also praised them "for respecting human rights". The promotion comes just 10 days after the UN human rights body released a report saying that Venezuelan security forces had carried out hundreds of arbitrary killings.

While other data on Thursday showed private payrolls rising less than expected last month and a surprise increase in new applications for unemployment benefits last week, overall labor market conditions continue to tighten. The labor market is considered to be near or at full employment, with the jobless rate at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent. The unemployment rate has dropped by three-tenths of a percentage point this year and is near the Federal Reserve’s forecast of 3.6 percent by the end of this year.
"American voters remain steadfast in their support for immigration reform with a path to citizenship, with more than 70 percent who want to see reform passed this year."	The vast majority of swing voters across the United States oppose the Democrats’ latest plan to abolish all immigration enforcement by ending the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. In recent weeks, Democrats in the House and Senate, along with progressive liberals like Cynthia Nixon in New York and most recently insurgent Democrat candidate for Congress, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have been demanding ICE be abolished and all immigration enforcement be ended. House Democrats are now crafting legislation that would officially abolish ICE. The latest Harvard/Harris Poll, though, reveals that swing voters are overwhelmingly opposed to the Democrats’ plan to end all immigration enforcement across the U.S.
Nearly 3-in-4 swing voters, about 73 percent, of swing voters said they do not want ICE to be disbanded. Less than 30 percent of swing voters said they support the abolishment of ICE.

The government will appoint a national LGBT health adviser and take measures to end so-called conversion therapy as part of a plan to deliver what Theresa May has promised will be “real and lasting change”. The proposals form part of an action plan published by the Equalities Office on Tuesday. It follows a UK-wide survey of LGBT people that had more than 108,000 responses, billed as the largest study of its kind. The 30-page plan contains a series of pledges, including to improve the police response to LGBT hate incidents, more support for LGBT students and teachers and improvements to gender identity services for transgender adults. The proposals, which will receive an initial £4.5m in funding, were welcomed by the campaign groups Stonewall and the LGBT Foundation.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.

The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.
Any legislative action that is taken now could very well be rendered completely null and void by the decision of the Supreme Court expected this June.	The strategy reprises last year's successful approach to confirming Justice Neil Gorsuch in the early spring of 2017. Gorsuch was named to fill the vacancy left by the death of Antonin Scalia and then kept open by the refusal of the Senate's Republican majority to consider Merrick Garland, the replacement named by President Barack Obama in 2016. Gorsuch was greeted with delight by abortion opponents, even though he had not ruled directly on Roe in his judicial career. But his confirmation was far from a sure thing because two Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, were seen as defenders of abortion rights.

So then, as now, the president said he wasn't even going to bring up the case he had promised would be overturned "automatically" by the justices he would name as president.
Im the only (Republican)candidate that has actually reduced the size of government.	In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners. Alas, he is wasting his time trying to shift the views of the Democratic Party, which has become ever more left-wing, if not outright socialist. I think it is time for Mr. James to become a Republican. Guy Randolph
Savannah, Ga.
It’s shocking that Mr. James is surprised by the positive economic results of less regulation and lower taxes.
"After how hard you work and how much you pay in taxes, New York City ends up getting the money. Im Chris Jacobs. I think its time we have someone in Albany thats making sure our region gets our fair share"	Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
Amazing fact: Senate has already voted on more amendments in 2015 than Reid allowed ALL YEAR last year.	It was President Obama who left his party in this position. His anti-business agenda was unpopular, but was never revisited. Democrats’ losses over the past decade stemmed in large part from a slow-growth economy that never gained momentum. Even though he received what he called a “shellacking” in the 2010 midterms, and even though the GOP made unprecedented political gains during his tenure, President Obama was always convinced the country was behind him. As Mara Liasson wrote for NPR in 2016: “During Obama's eight years in office, the Democrats have lost more House, Senate, state legislative and governors seats than under any other president.” She noted that the Obama legacy includes “one huge failure: a diminished Democratic Party.”
In 2013, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., invoked the so-called “nuclear option,” discarding traditional filibuster protections for the minority party in favor of requiring only a simple majority to approve judicial and executive branch nominees.
Says state Supreme Court candidate Joe Donald twice supported incumbent Justice Rebecca Bradley.	The president told Fox News that he believes his nominee will get some support from Democrats. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, an abortion rights supporter, is considered one of the key votes on a nominee. She said she wouldn't vote for someone who would overturn Roe v. Wade. "A candidate who would overturn Roe would not be acceptable," she said Sunday on ABC's This Week. Collins, who has previously bucked party lines on other key issues such as health care, said she plans to have an in-depth conversation with the nominee.
"One out of every four students fails to earn a high school diploma. In our major cities across America, half of our kids dont graduate."	“Regardless of political parties, we need people to make a decision about what’s happening in the classroom,” said Marisol Garcia, vice president of the Arizona Education Association. “To limit ourselves and to say ‘only these people are going to support us’ is just not true.”
Teachers can be at a disadvantage compared to wealthier candidates, who tend to have built-in networks of potential donors. The NEA’s Eskelsen Garcia experienced that firsthand when she ran for Congress in Utah in 1998, recalling mystified looks and wary questions from people trying to figure out who was bankrolling her (she lost to the Republican nominee in the general election). But teachers, especially experienced ones, can benefit from their network of former students and their real-life connection to middle-class voters. “As a teacher married to a teacher, I know what it’s like to work paycheck to paycheck,” said Tom Niermann, a teacher running to unseat Rep. Kevin Yoder (R-Kan.) in suburban Kansas City.
There were 36 states where Republicans who were in charge refused to implement a state (health insurance) exchange.	Kinner was being held without bail at the Ada County jail on 15 charges, including six of injury to a child and nine of aggravated battery, jail records showed. There was no lawyer listed for Kinner in the records. Kinner may have wanted to “extract vengeance” for being kicked out by a tenant who took him in, Police Chief Bill Bones said at a press conference on Sunday. The woman who took Kinner in was not harmed and was not at the residence at the time of the attack. Kinner assaulted the children at the party after he was unable to find the woman, police said, adding his motive was still under investigation.
"Says a tweet he sent out wasnt saying, check out a sex tape. It was just take a look at the background of Alicia Machado."	Hill denied the allegations in an emailed statement to IndyStar. Details of the accusations are outlined in a confidential June 18 memorandum prepared by the Taft Stettinius & Hollister law firm at the request of legislative leaders. The eight-page memo summarizes interviews that House and Senate leaders or their legal counsel conducted with six women who attended the end-of-session party at AJ’s Lounge, a bar just south of Downtown, during the early morning hours of March 15.

According to the memo:
One lawmaker said an intoxicated Hill put his hands on her back, slid them down her back, put them under her clothes and grabbed her buttocks. She told him to “back off” and walked away, but Hill approached her again later and again reached under her clothing and grabbed her buttocks.
Aphotograph of 21-year-old Hillary Clinton featured a Confederate battle flag in the background.	Ethiopia's government has fired five prison officials as it confronts allegations of torture and other abuses of inmates as part of a wave of reforms. Among those fired is the federal prison chief who until recently defended the treatment of inmates as "fair." The firings came ahead of a new Human Rights Watch report released Thursday that documents widespread arbitrary detention, torture, rape and humiliation over several years in Ethiopia's eastern Somali region. It urges new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to investigate the "horrific" situation. Abiy has admitted that security forces have tortured people but has yet to "tackle Ethiopia's culture of impunity and ensure accountability," said Felix Horne, senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Texas leads the nation in the percentage of residents without health insurance.	But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said. Tackett said he's concerned about children, especially in Eastern Kentucky, which has a higher rate of Medicaid patients and some of the state's worst oral health. "I have no problem with them regulating the adults that are on Medicaid," Tackett said. "If they are young and healthy, they should be out working or doing something.
This administration and this Congress have been systematically cutting funding to border security since the Democrats took control.	Him raping and beating is not ‘annoying,’ it goes beyond that,” Zittlau told her client. “No, that is not something you deserve or a normal way of life,” she added. Spencer Platt via Getty Images Volunteers help walk dozens of women and their children, many fleeing poverty and violence in Honduras, Guatamala and El Salvador, to a relief center following their release from Customs and Border Protection on June 22, 2018 in McAllen, Texas. Once women migrants cross the border into the United States, they risk losing their children and may struggle to get a hold of basic necessities, like clean underwear and menstrual hygiene products.
A new college tuition reciprocity agreement with Minnesota makes college education more affordable for Wisconsin residents.	At least 41 alleged injuries have been reported, but NHTSA has yet to publicly offer any answers. Now at the two-year anniversary of the investigation, safety advocates are expressing frustration over the limited information coming out of NHTSA, reports CBS News correspondent Kris Van Cleave. Following our reports and the decision by a number of police departments to start parking Explorers, Ford began offering a free repair if a customer asks for it. The automaker claims it "effectively resolves" the problem. NHTSA has received almost 200 complaints about the issue.
Says Cory Booker supports late-term and partial-birth abortion and opposes safety regulations.	And certainly Trump would deserve great credit for seeing the possibility of a peaceful solution where many of his advisers saw military action as the only option. In the meantime, we have much hard work ahead. It won’t be easy, and it won’t be quick. William J. Perry is a former secretary of defense.
Mitt Romney is the first major party candidate for president of the United States in modern times not to release at least 12 years of tax returns.	Three of the teens were named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit. Howard told U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Dillon during a status conference Tuesday that all three original plaintiffs are no longer part of the case. But he said another teen "is anxious to participate in the case" and will be named as a new plaintiff. "We believe that his allegations with respect to his experience at the facility are sufficiently analogous ... to those of John Does Nos. 1, 2 and 3," Howard said.
"In the month of July alone, EU exports to South Korea increased by over 36 percent. A lot of that is our market share. Those are our farmers and our service providers who are suffering."	“This tariff is going to hurt the U.S. manufacturers who import from China more than the companies who export from China to the U.S.”
China is imposing tariffs on U.S. products including soybeans and autos. Many U.S. companies and economists say the impact from the initial round of tariffs is likely to be contained, but worry what will happen if the conflict escalates. “The $50 billion has been more or less priced in,” said Li-Gang Liu, chief China economist at Citigroup. “But if this escalation were to be there, impact would be bigger and unknown to global financial market and global economy.”
‘The timing stinks.
"Gov. Rick Perry spent over a million dollars on D.C. lobbyists asking for more federal money and lives in a luxury house that costs taxpayers $10,000 a month."	Even Pruitt’s own staff had begun to sour on him, with many worrying that their future career prospects would be damaged by their association with Pruitt’s tenure. Each scandal seemed more damning than the last. Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.
"As Virginia lost over 65,000 jobs, (Tim) Kaine put partisan ambitions first by serving as DNC chairman during the last year of his governorship."

He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers.

The DNC says McCain flip-flopped on whether the Iraq War would be easy.	The nonpartisan Cook Political Report says Democrats are "likely" to carry Montana in the Senate race. Inside Elections rates the contest as one that "tilts Democratic." After the rally, the spokesman for Tester's re-election campaign put out a statement that was critical of Rosendale but which did not mention the president. "Jon's record is clear—if it's good for Montana, Jon works with anyone from either party to get things done. If it's bad for Montana, he'll stand up to anyone," Tester spokesman Chris Meagher said.
Says Ohio law gives tax breaks to rich people who own private jets.	Michael Avenatti told POLITICO that he's being targeted over his political views. | Seth Wenig/AP Photo Feds target Avenatti over old firm's unpaid taxes U.S. Attorney accuses Trump critic of 'misrepresentations' and 'misconduct.' U.S. Government lawyers are slamming one of President Donald Trump's most prominent critics, attorney Michael Avenatti, over nearly half a million dollars in unpaid federal taxes owed by his former firm. Avenatti's former law firm, Eagan Avenatti LLP, agreed to make the roughly $452,000 tax payment last month in order to resolve a bankruptcy case, but the funds never arrived at the IRS, according to a filing Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, Calif.

The submission from tax lawyers in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles attacks Avenatti personally, accusing him of trying to scam the federal government.

"Says Zack Space voted for budgets and debt, energy taxes and the stimulus, and we still lost more than 2.5 million jobs."	Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) trashed the June jobs report — even though it showed rapid job growth, rising wages, and low unemployment. The report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that employers created 213,000 new jobs in June — 22,000 more than economists had expected. Manufacturing jobs in particular rose by 36,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.
Says Paul Ryans budget plan ends Medicare.	But it would concern me a lot if they are expanding the nuclear program as they meet with the president. I don't want a war with North Korea. A lot of people would be killed and hurt. CHUCK TODD:

"In every ethics case that has resulted in a formal sanction, theres been an investigative subcommittee thats been established first."	The report also said that Strzok repeatedly pushed for more aggressive action in the Clinton probe. "The conduct by these employees cast a cloud over the entire FBI investigation and sowed doubt about the FBI’s work," the report concluded. "The damage caused by these employees’ actions extends far beyond the scope of the (Clinton) investigation and goes to the heart of the FBI’s reputation for neutral fact finding and political independence." Goelman, in an op-ed in USA TODAY last month, said Strzok has become the victim of "political gamesmanship" by Congress and President Trump, who has repeatedly tweeted about Strzok as evidence of bias by the FBI and Justice Department. "They have spent months cynically taking these texts out of context and saying that one- or two-word snippets somehow prove that the FBI investigations of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the Russia probe itself, were biased," Goelman wrote.
Says New Hampshire has the third-highest property tax in the country.	Yet those people were served. And since it is in Virginia, was Sanders even the first member of the Trump administration to eat there? Maybe others less recognizable had already come and gone. As for “compassion,” what compassion are you showing for someone who, for all you know, may struggle with certain elements of her job herself? What compassion are you showing in a country where the Supreme Court just ruled on gay customers being denied services in a cake shop, yet your gay staff members want you to refuse service to someone they don’t like?
"Obama's tax plan cuts taxes ""for 95 percent of all working families."""	3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.
Says Colorado Democraticcongressional candidate MorganCarroll racked up $11 billion in new spending in the state Legislature.	That came on the heels of 0.9 percent drop in March, the first monthly drop since July of 2017. Total private construction rose 0.3 percent, with residential projects up 0.8 percent in May. New single-family home construction rose 0.6 percent and the volatile apartment building sector jumped 1.6 percent. Private, non-residential building fell 0.3 percent. Economists are forecasting that construction spending will contribute to overall growth this year even though interest rates are rising.
59 percent of Americans today believe that Barack Obama is still a Muslim.	“They’ve twisted American values,” she said in a follow-up phone interview. “A lot of them are anti-God, anti-religion and anti-military.”
In the survey, most say they are proud to be Americans, although Republicans feel that way more strongly (90 percent) than Democrats (61 percent). There is no consensus when asked about the country’s current course, though: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. “Overwhelming majorities of those in both parties and independents agree that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.”” USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll
The USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll of 1,004 adults, taken online June 26-27, has a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The survey is one of a year-long series on American values.

"People were hopeless. Sixty percent of the population, 70 percent of the population wanted to live somewhere else. . . . By the time I left, 70 percent wanted to stay."	"I told them how I was feeling, but they didn’t listen to me." There were no beds, so Rosa laid on the floor. She said she wondered whether she might die there on the cold, hard, floor of that Arizona detention center. "Thanks to God," she said, "I am better."
A bill delaying the start of classes until Labor Day would permit school districts to shave 5 full weeks off the school year.	A Texas mother claims her son was attacked at a Whataburger in San Antonio because he was wearing a Trump-supporting MAGA hat. The mother posted a video of the incident on Facebook. The woman claimed a man became angry at her teenage son and his group of friends because one of them wore a “Make American Great Again” hat in support of President Donald Trump, KENS5 reported. The video shows the man throwing his fountain drink at the table and shouting a racial slur. In her post on Facebook, that has since been taken down, Patricia Spittler asks for help in identifying the man she called “scum bag of the year,” the San Antonio CBS affiliate reported.
On whether the United States should intervene in Libya.	What more was I supposed to do?” she asked. The Mail cites research published this week by the Royal College of Physicians, which suggests that Britain is training only half the number of doctors the country will require by 2030 — with the NHS increasingly turning to foreign doctors to plug the gaps. Fully 108,000 of 289,000 doctors currently on the medical register qualified overseas, around tw0-thirds of whom qualified outside the European Union — including 25,000 from India, 12,000 from Pakistan, and 5,000 from Nigeria. While most of these foreign doctors are perfectly capable, a disproportionate number turn out to be incompetent, with more than half of doctors subject to ‘fitness to practice’ investigation by the General Medical Council (GMC) being non-British. Critics suggest that plundering the Third World of clinicians rather than training British talent will disincentivise poor countries from investing in medical training, as the investment is a waste of limited resources if doctors simply leave for Western countries once qualified.

Says Texas ranks 49th nationally in what we are doing to support our per-pupil investment in education in the state.	'We’re going to run different'
His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
"Despite keeping distance from national media interviewers, I did local press all along, the last three months."	In the four days since he was elected, he has repeatedly said he didn't want bodyguards and that "the people will protect me." He has also said the crowd of press also serves to protect him, but complained half-jokingly about the crush of journalists that accompany him everywhere — even interviewing him from motorcycles that shadow his car's every move. He said Thursday: "I would like a little, just a little bit, of privacy."
"What we said was, you can keep (your plan) if it hasnt changed since the law passed."	But Britain's biggest business lobby group, the Confederation of British Industry, welcomed Friday's announcement as a "good starting point." "This is a genuine confidence boost and the prime minister deserves credit for delivering a unified approach" said Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director general, in a statement. Yet elements of the plan are likely to be unacceptable to the European Union. The world's biggest trading bloc only grants unfettered market access to countries where all its citizens have the right to live and work. May wants to end this freedom of movement, replacing it with a vague "mobility framework."
"In 2006, Bernie Sanders voted in the House with hard-line Republicans for indefinite detention for undocumented immigrants, and then he sided with those Republicans to stand with vigilantes known as Minutemen who were taking up outposts along the border to hunt down immigrants."	Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) tweeted a still more vague yet somehow more expansive vision Tuesday, calling for “restructuring the agencies that enforce our immigration laws, including ICE.”
Such aspirationalism allows establishment Democrats to harness the power behind the idea of abolishing ICE without taking a meaningful position on the underlying goal that animates that movement ― to radically undercut the government’s deportation efforts.Sen.

"Says Florida didnt offer special incentives to Deutsche Bank, which announced it will add 300 jobs in Florida."	A judge ordered federal emergency officials to extend vouchers for temporary hotel housing for nearly 1,700 Puerto Rican hurricane evacuees, saying ending the program could cause irreparable harm. Saturday night's decision came shortly after civil rights group LatinoJustice PRLDEF filed a lawsuit seeking relief for the Puerto Ricans, whose federal housing assistance vouchers were set to expire at midnight Sunday, meaning the evacuees could have been evicted from the hotels. The order says the agency cannot end its Transitional Sheltering Assistance program until at least midnight on Tuesday. The organization is pushing to let families stay another six months. U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin of Massachusetts wrote that ending the program would drain other public resources.
Says she was the first in her family to go to a four-year college.	Mazzochi, an attorney, already has name recognition in DuPage County, he said, because of her experience on the College of DuPage Board. She was elected to that board in April 2015 and has been chairman or acting chairman since December 2015, which was a tumultuous time for the college. She will face Democrat James M. “Jim” Caffrey in the November election to represent the 47th district. Bellock said she was not looking for a full-time job after she retired from the Illinois House, but the governor and his team asked her to head the health care and family services department. “I look at this as a real honor,” Bellock said.
"There was a Gallup poll in Egypt last year, and 70 percent of Egyptians dont want our money."	Calls for an Iran without its current “dictatorial regime” were met with strengthened hope during the annual “free Iran” rally held in Paris this past weekend by the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), an exiled Paris-based Iranian opposition group allied with the Mujaheddin-e-Khalq (MEK). The rally, which event organizers said saw more than 100,000 attendees, took place at the Villepinte Congress Center, outside of Paris on Saturday. A series of panel discussions ranging in topic from women’s rights to denuclearization took place on Friday. The Guardian reported there was “a crowd of about 4,000, many of them refugees and young eastern Europeans who had been bussed in to attend the rally in return for a weekend trip to Paris.”
Distinguished speakers at Saturday’s event included former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal attorney; New Mexico’s former Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson; former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich; former Sen. Robert Torricelli (D-NJ); former FBI Director Louis Freeh; former Homeland Security Adviser Frances Townsend; and former U.S. Army chief of staff Gen. George Casey.
"The truth of the matter is that during my administration, the FBI's crime statistics show that violent crime was reduced in Massachusetts by 7 percent."

"However, the unrelenting attacks on me personally [and] my family, are unprecedented and have taken a sizable toll on all of us," Pruitt added. Pruitt resigned less than a week after The New York Times reported that the EPA's chief ethics official, Kevin Minoli, had been pushing for a series of independent investigation into several aspects of Pruitt's tenure. Those include Pruitt's rental of a Washington D.C. condominium for $50 per day from the spouse of a prominent fossil fuel lobbyist and his alleged use of staff to handle personal matters.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Fred Knapp/NET News Fred Knapp/NET News
Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.

The nonpartisan Cook Political Report says Democrats are "likely" to carry Montana in the Senate race. Inside Elections rates the contest as one that "tilts Democratic." After the rally, the spokesman for Tester's re-election campaign put out a statement that was critical of Rosendale but which did not mention the president.

On letting Occupy Atlanta protesters stay in Woodruff Park.	PORTLAND, Ore. -- Two opposing protest groups -- Patriot Prayer and antifa -- clashed in downtown Portland Saturday, CBS Portland affiliate KOIN reports. Portland police said failure to leave the area could leave to arrests, calling the demonstration a riot. More than 100 members of Patriot Prayer group gathered at Terry Schrunk Plaza for a "freedom rally," while more than 100 counter protesters with an antifa group gathered across the street at Chapman Square for rallies before a march. Police revoked Patriot Prayer's permit for the rally after the two groups began to clash. People were lighting firecrackers and smoke bombs in the crowd while police used flash bangs in an effort to disperse the clashing protesters.

"There are more African American men in prison, jail, on probation or parole than were enslaved in 1850."	On the Fourth of July, 1852, America celebrated its freedom, as it does every Independence Day. Frederick Douglass, America’s most famous anti-slavery activist and fugitive slave, saw no ground to celebrate: he saw the octopus arms of slavery stretched everywhere, exposing the hollowness of America’s freedom values. That holiday, he delivered the greatest antislavery speech in American history. Not least since the racism that made slavery endures.
"In first week as governor, Tim Kaine proposed a nearly $4 billion tax increase, $4 billion, including a tax increase on people earning as little as $17,000 a year."

He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.

It's difficult to imagine Old Hickory, as he was known, excusing himself from military duty on the grounds that he could not march long distances, as Mr Trump did during the Vietnam War, citing bone spurs. The parallels between the 45th president and the 13th - unlucky for some - are arguably more compelling. Fillmore launched his career in the 1820s with the Anti-Masonic Party, hawking a paranoid rumour that ruling Freemasons were murdering whistleblowers. Mr Trump paved the way for his White House bid by peddling a conspiracy theory, too - that President Barack Obama was not a US citizen.

The states have always defined marriage.	The use of robots to commune with people with Alzheimer’s opens up a whole box of moral quandaries, not least the prospect of some cognitive threshold beneath which patients will be pushed into the arms of machines, rather than humans. It is worth remembering too that like the digital “assistants” now entering people’s homes, Pepper and the current robo-carers do not offer anything approaching the nuances and complexities of genuine human interchange, rather an app store version that most people would consider a matter of erratic entertainment rather than a day-do-day necessity. But as and when robots manage to convincingly perform as make-believe humans, what then? Paradoxically, key voices in the tech world have long believed that as automation sweeps through large swathes of the economy, with the right fiscal adjustments, it will increase the numbers of human caregivers, and elevate them above the low-paid parts of the labour market where such roles are currently concentrated. Last year, for example, a writer in Wired magazine said that such roles as “companions to the elderly, home health aides, babysitters, special-needs aides, and more” demanded to be taken more seriously, and that “the riches resulting from increased automation … could be used to help fund caregiving programs”.

Last year, a federal appeals court ruled that Pruitt overstepped his authority in trying to stall an Obama-era rule requiring companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks. — AGRICULTURE: In March 2017, a month after becoming EPA administrator, Pruitt delayed consideration of banning usage of a widely used pesticide, chlorpyrifos, on food crops for at least five years. The pesticide has been banned for household use since 2001, but agriculture groups want to keep using it.
The FCCs net neutrality policy includes whatis essentially a massive tax increase.	There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void. In New Jersey, this is compounded by the fact that the state is located between two big cities, New York and Philadelphia, that are in other states. The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.

In some ways, the city was a haven for the gay community where people could be themselves. But there were also raids on gay bars, harassment, and discrimination: "An individual who was quiet and who was closeted gay, could find companionship, could find love and joy, could have a job, could have a house, so long as this individual never spoke the dreaded H.

"As governor, I've stood up to ... the big oil companies."	While not as eye-catching as, for example, his demand that his official vehicle use sirens so he could reach a French restaurant on time, Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left behind a demoralized agency where staff fret that their ability to protect public health has been diminished. A staunch ally of oil and gas companies, Pruitt stacked EPA advisory boards with industry representatives and sought to set aside whole troves of research that link pollution to various illnesses. He oversaw the delay or destruction of dozens of clean air and water rules, sparking legal battles with states and environmental groups. The EPA’s record in court under Pruitt was patchy but his deregulatory zeal was enough to impress Trump, who said Pruitt was doing a “fantastic job” even as scandals that sparked more than a dozen different investigations swirled around him. Pruitt became a trusted advisor to Trump, helping convince the president the US should withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.

"Says abortion doctors are flying into this state, performing abortions and flying out."	Hope Life Center in western Illinois provides unplanned pregnancy counseling and ultrasounds for about five to 10 women a week, with a mission to “erase abortion from Illinois one woman and one child at time,” according to its website. So Executive Director Debbie Case was alarmed by a change last year in the state's so-called right-of-conscience law, requiring health care providers to inform pregnant patients of all available medical options, including abortion. She said the pregnancy center even shut down for part of 2017 because its physician feared potential repercussions of violating the law, which is now temporarily blocked by the courts. Case and other anti-abortion advocates across the state hailed Tuesday’s ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court against a similar law in California on First Amendment grounds, hoping the decision will strengthen their legal battle in Illinois. “We’re definitely encouraged,” said Case, whose center is in Sterling, about two hours west of Chicago.

There have been at least 100 shootings each year [Angel Taveras] has been mayor of Providence.	On this much police and activist South Side priest Michael Pfleger can agree: Saturday morning’s anti-violence march on the Dan Ryan Expressway is all about danger. Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.

But Crowley’s most challenging hurdle is a stark reality for all Democrats this cycle: falling voter turnout. A new Pew Research study found that while the youngest generations, including Generation X, Millennials, and the post-Millennial generation, make up of the bulk of eligible voters in 2018, if turnout outcomes from the 2014 midterms persist, they are less inclined to comprise of the majority of voters who cast ballots this November.

In one case, Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion that illegal immigrants do not have the same bargaining rights as American citizens and legal workers. “… an illegal immigrant worker is not an ’employee’ under the NLRA for the simple reason that, ever since 1986, an illegal immigrant worker is not a lawful ’employee’ in the United States,” Kavanaugh wrote. In another case, Kavanaugh noted that American multi-national corporations do not have the right to import foreign workers. The Circuit judge explained, “Under the provision of the immigration laws at issue here, mere economic expediency does not authorize an employer to displace American workers for foreign workers.”
Prominent conservative Ann Coulter has also called for Trump to nominate Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, arguing that other judges such as Thomas Hardiman and Raymond Kethledge “are open borders zealots.”

But even those sympathetic to the biggest retailer in the US are questioning whether there has been more take than give. Amazon has long been accused of stretching the city’s transit and education systems, and its highly paid workers have driven up prices of goods and housing. The resentful murmur recently became a roar after Amazon reacted to the city’s latest tax proposal, which would have charged large businesses an annual $275 per employee, by resorting to what critics call blackmail.
I have had the challenge during this administration to suspend no less than 37 public officials in about 36 months.	The latest high-level departure from President Donald Trump's Cabinet was not the most unexpected departure that has faced the administration. Scott Pruitt, the administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency, came under fire multiple times during his tenure over questionable finances, including both excessive spending and sweetheart deals that helped him spend less than expected. Here's a review of his time in office. Dec. 7, 2016: Trump announces that Pruitt will be his nominee for EPA administrator
The then-Attorney General of Oklahoma was touted by Trump as having "great qualifications and a good record." Part of that record was Pruitt touting himself as a "leading advocate against the EPA's activist agenda," and his history of challenging the EPA was well known.

Pruitt's confirmation, which was approved with a vote of 52-46, came in the midst of a court order that required him to turn over thousands of communications with major coal, oil and gas companies from his time in office. Democratic senators expressed outrage that Republicans were going ahead as scheduled with the vote on Pruitt, despite the judge’s ruling in the order. March 23, 2017: Defends budget cuts to his agency
The budget plan put forward by the Trump administration proposed cuts 31 percent of the EPA’s funding, including significant reductions to research programs and enforcement of clean air and clean water programs, but that didn’t bother Pruitt.

Conditions in the agricultural sector reportedly improved somewhat, but contacts were concerned about the effect of potentially higher tariffs on their exports.”
These reports are from the economy’s ground floor, not the Beltway penthouse. They show that U.S. tariffs and the risks of retaliation are creating uncertainty that could reduce business investment. This probably won’t show up in GDP for the recently completed second quarter because the tariff impact is only starting to be felt.

Officials said people who had been in the areas around where the pair had been before collapsing should wash their clothes, although they insisted risk of contamination was minimal. The pair is now being treated in the same hospital where Skripal and his daughter spent weeks in critical condition following the attack, which London blamed on Moscow. Russia vehemently denied the accusations, insisting it doesn’t have any nerve agents. And Moscow even went as far as to blame Britain for the attack, saying it was part of a larger effort to foster anti-Russian sentiment. The exposure will inevitably raise fresh questions about the insistence by authorities that there was no broader risk to the public from the March attack.

It was very much a celebration of the creation of a system that offered universal healthcare based on clinical need rather than ability to pay.

The BBC's Nick Robinson hopes that the 70th anniversary will be marked by "a healthier national conversation focused on how to help those who care for us, and help more people live longer, healthier lives." He wroted: "The gift the health service needs is an open, honest, clear-headed diagnosis of its strengths and, yes, its weaknesses, too. That and a national conversation."

Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, one of the most powerful conservatives in Congress, has denied reports that he ignored the alleged sexual abuse of athletes while he worked as an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University more than 20 years ago. Allegations that Jordan was aware of sexual misconduct and explicitly was informed of specific incidents of alleged assault by the wrestling team's doctor, first surfaced in an NBC news story on Tuesday. But Jordan — who was an assistant coach from 1987 until 1995, when he was elected to the state legislature — has refuted the claims. "Congressman Jordan never saw any abuse, never heard about any abuse, and never had any abuse reported to him during his time as a coach at Ohio State," Ian Fury, Jordan's spokesman, said in a statement. "He has not been contacted by investigators about the matter but will assist them in any way they ask, because if what is alleged is true, the victims deserve a full investigation and justice."
Race to the Top grants require participating states to adopt the Common Core standards as a condition for receiving federal funding.	This was particularly an issue for Pruitt’s former executive scheduler Sydney Hupp, who often had to shell out for Pruitt’s trips. Hupp was also asked by Pruitt to speak with staff at one of Trump’s hotels, believing he could get a deal on a second-hand mattress they were selling. Pruitt remained miserly even when he was abusing his position to get a good deal. He fell behind on the rental payments on the condo he was getting on the cheap and eventually had to be evicted and the locks were changed.

"McCain sought the political support of minister John Hagee, ""who believes Hurricane Katrina was God's punishment for gay rights and called the Catholic Church 'the Antichrist' and a 'false cult.'"""	As the Italian hierarchy aligns itself ever more closely with the open-borders movement, the country’s citizens — most of whom are Catholic — seem to be moving in the opposite direction, creating a curious lay-clerical split. Italy’s interior minister, Matteo Salvini, is now the most trusted politician in the country by a significant margin, a position he has earned above all by his firm stance against unchecked mass migration. Yet when Salvini refused debarkation rights in late June to the NGO vessel Aquarius that was carrying hundreds of African migrants, the Italian bishops were among those protesting most loudly. “It is Jesus coming to us on a vessel, he is in the man or child who drowns, it is Jesus who fishes through the garbage in search of a little food,” said Cardinal Francesco Montenegro, archbishop of Agrigento, in his July 1 homily. “Immigrants, the poor, are a thermometer for our faith,” he continued.

He contended that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide from roughly 300 to 400 parts per million over the last century had not triggered “dramatic consequences”. Play Video 0:32 Andrew Probyn calls Tony Abbott 'destructive' in ABC report – video

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

Durbin’s advocacy for mass-migration and for younger ‘dreamer’ illegals has caused the Democrats much political pain. He pushed for the abortive budget-shutdown in January 2018, and for the “Gang of Eight” amnesty bill in 2013 which helped the Democrats lose nine seats in 2014. The Democrats’ top leader in the Senate, Sen. Chuck Schumer, is keeping his distance from the “Abolish ICE” campaign. He is instead using his Twitter account to tout Democrats’ promises on healthcare, guns, gay status, and claims that President Donald Trump is tied to Russian President Vladimir Putin. On the Abolish ICE campaign, Schumer is instead calling for a “czar” to focus media attention on “reunifying families.” That topic polls better for Democrats than ending immigration enforcement.
"14,000 Americans . . . lose their health insurance every single day."	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”

Teaching kids to recognize what is average teen stress and what is not is how Naperville area youth organizations are responding to a survey conducted last year. The cause of youth stress in Naperville was the focus of a 2018 State of the Kids report released in January and based on the results of an October 2017 survey done with seventh-graders and 10th-graders in Naperville School District 203 and Indian Prairie School District 204. The report gave a snapshot of the top stressors affecting kids, what factors contribute to daily stress and how the community might help kids manage or prevent the stress they’re experiencing. Seven of 10 seventh-graders and nearly eight in 10 sophomores say they experience moderate or high levels of daily stress. About half of both groups say the stress makes it difficult to perform daily tasks because they feel overwhelmed by anxiety, lack focus and struggle to concentrate.

Johnson said Richards left “a trail of misery in her wake – over 2.5 million babies aborted on her watch, a decrease of 51% in breast cancer screenings, a grand total of zero mammograms, a drop of 65% in pap smears, and an organization that has eschewed healthcare in favor of building a political movement by serving 670,540 less patients since 2006.”

"The last election — the presidential election as well as this election coming forward — a lot of people awakened," he said. "It’s looking pretty good," he affirmed. "I’m young, black and a Democrat. I want to be viewed different so we’re going to run different."
The state budget proposal has been submitted on time and [its] the earliest that a governor has done so in over two decades.	Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
Ohio is not meeting its obligation to update voter registrations when voters change their address with the BMV.	This was particularly an issue for Pruitt’s former executive scheduler Sydney Hupp, who often had to shell out for Pruitt’s trips. Hupp was also asked by Pruitt to speak with staff at one of Trump’s hotels, believing he could get a deal on a second-hand mattress they were selling. Pruitt remained miserly even when he was abusing his position to get a good deal. He fell behind on the rental payments on the condo he was getting on the cheap and eventually had to be evicted and the locks were changed.

No one was ever arrested for the blaze, although Fieseler writes about how investigators keyed into one main suspect in the fire — a disgruntled bar patron who'd been kicked out earlier in the day and had been heard threatening to burn the place down. It wasn't until 2003 that a plaque commemorating the fire's victims was laid. New Orleans was a conflicted place for the gay community at the time of the fire, Fieseler says. In some ways, the city was a haven for the gay community where people could be themselves. But there were also raids on gay bars, harassment, and discrimination: "An individual who was quiet and who was closeted gay, could find companionship, could find love and joy, could have a job, could have a house, so long as this individual never spoke the dreaded H.

The Labour leader has said the result of the 2016 vote should be respected, but his frontbenchers have been careful not to explicitly rule out a second referendum if the circumstances change. Earlier in the day, Len McCluskey, Unite’s general secretary, said May’s government had lost all authority or capacity to make decisions. “We are not, I repeat for my friends in the media, not, calling for a second referendum … But we remain open to the possibility of a vote on any deal the Tories come back with,” he said. “These people see in Brexit the chance to turn Britain into the low-wage, deregulated, race-to-the-bottom society of their dreams. But Brexit is turning into a nightmare for the rest of us – a nightmare of uncertainty above all.

Our Founding Fathers resolved that without freedom Americans could not enjoy life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. To secure it, they fought a war to break free from the bonds of tyranny. It isn’t a faraway tyrant that oppresses us today. Rather, we are in the grip of a new kind of tyranny — that of mistrust. This tyrant sits on a throne in our minds and is just as cruel as King George was during the time of the Founders.
"Youll find blacks in almost every regiment throughout the South who fought right alongside white Southerners, during the Civil War."	I noticed the upside-down portrait of Hamilton several years ago while in western Pennsylvania reporting for what would become Amity and Prosperity: One Family and the Fracturing of America, my book exploring the ways rural Americans have been left behind, and how their disenfranchisement has spawned cultural resentment against liberal, urban Americans. I didn’t understand the nature of that rage until I arrived in Amity, Pennsylvania. I was raised in the eastern part of the state – or commonwealth, as Pennsylvanians prefer to call it. Until my grandmother died, my family had lived on the same land since before the revolutionary war, and my ancestors billeted George Washington’s soldiers at a place called Camp Woods in 1777. Nearly a century later, when the civil war began, my great-great-great grandfather, Gen George Gordon Meade, a well-educated Philadelphian who attended West Point, led the union army at the Battle of Gettysburg, a town lying between the eastern, more urban part of Pennsylvania and the rural west.

While other data on Thursday showed private payrolls rising less than expected last month and a surprise increase in new applications for unemployment benefits last week, overall labor market conditions continue to tighten. The labor market is considered to be near or at full employment, with the jobless rate at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent. The unemployment rate has dropped by three-tenths of a percentage point this year and is near the Federal Reserve’s forecast of 3.6 percent by the end of this year.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.

The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.

Many of the men and women who respond to these tragedies have become heroes and victims at once.
Turkey is an Arab country.	Straight-A students are being turned away from British medical schools and forced to pay for training in Eastern Europe, while the National Health Service (NHS) plunders the Third World for already-trained doctors instead. The Daily Mail spoke to a number of star students who earned top A-levels and supplemented their CVs with spells volunteering at local GP surgeries, overseas clinics, hospices, and pharmacies — and even earned degrees in related fields such as Biomedical Science — who were turned away from British medical schools, despite the NHS facing a shortfall of some 10,000 doctors. Department of Health and Social Care figures show that only 6,000 of 18,000 medical school applicants were awarded places last year — with many of the 6,000 likely going to foreign applicants, who have often been favoured over British applicants. In fact, the Mail found that so many talented would-be medical students were being rejected that a cottage industry of English-language medical schools in countries such as Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Armenia, and Georgia have sprung up to cater to them — but even this option is not available to youngsters who cannot afford the fees.

Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods.

In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.

92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obamas first term belonged to women.	The endangered state of American liberal democracy, he argues, calls for emergency steps from Democrats and the left. They should take advantage of legal and constitutional silences to “transform American politics in a lasting progressive direction,” Faris writes. “Doing so will require party leaders to pursue policy changes that will be ridiculed by their opponents as outrageous affronts to democratic decency and received by their own voters with puzzlement or even shock. They need to do it anyway.”

Says President Barack Obama was responsible for the assassination of at least four American citizens in drone strikes.	President Donald Trump is not responsible for the killing of journalists in Annapolis last week. His belittling of the press — his “enemy of the American people” taunts, his promises to roll back libel laws, his fomenting rage toward specific journalists at rallies — is worth mentioning within the context of the murders, because it speaks to a larger concern that last Thursday’s attack on The Capital Gazette won’t be an isolated incident. Journalists, many of whom already risk their lives covering war and violence, many of whom receive death threats regularly, feel understandable jitters about a leader who tries to turn the American public against us, particularly when we watch a member of that public shoot up a newsroom and end five lives. It’s reckless and inaccurate, though, to pin the shootings on Trump. The suspect swore an oath to kill a Capital writer who wrote about him in 2011.
"It used to be the policy of the Republican Party to get rid of the Department of Education.

Teachers can be at a disadvantage compared to wealthier candidates, who tend to have built-in networks of potential donors.

Young estimates that around two-thirds of his union members were Trump supporters. That makes sense: It’s a law enforcement agency that leans white and male (72 percent male, 62 percent white), and many federal prisons are in rural parts of the country, which Trump dominated. But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau. BOP has long suffered the kind of problems you’d expect for a massive bureaucracy centered on caging tens of thousands of people.

Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.
Jim Renacci voted repeatedly to end Medicare.	It was President Obama who left his party in this position. His anti-business agenda was unpopular, but was never revisited. Democrats’ losses over the past decade stemmed in large part from a slow-growth economy that never gained momentum. Even though he received what he called a “shellacking” in the 2010 midterms, and even though the GOP made unprecedented political gains during his tenure, President Obama was always convinced the country was behind him. As Mara Liasson wrote for NPR in 2016: “During Obama's eight years in office, the Democrats have lost more House, Senate, state legislative and governors seats than under any other president.” She noted that the Obama legacy includes “one huge failure: a diminished Democratic Party.”
In 2013, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., invoked the so-called “nuclear option,” discarding traditional filibuster protections for the minority party in favor of requiring only a simple majority to approve judicial and executive branch nominees.
"Sen. Joe Liebermans home state has a public option which covers about 10,000 of its citizens that was introduced by its Republican governor."	"Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature. If it places the issue before voters, Nebraska would join Utah, where a ballot measure has been certified, and likely Idaho, where signatures are expected to be certified Friday. Montana's voters may also vote on a measure to extend their existing expansion which is set to expire in 2019. So far, 34 states have approved expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.
"Says this months special session will cost the state $27,300 a day just for legislators daily living expenses."	There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void. In New Jersey, this is compounded by the fact that the state is located between two big cities, New York and Philadelphia, that are in other states. The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.
Wind powers nearly 13 million homes across the country.	Nuclear wouldn't count toward the 50 percent mandate, and APS says its Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station is the largest electricity producer in the U.S.
Jeff Burke, APS director of resources planning, says customers would see 6 to 14 percent per year increases on their bills if the company is forced to ratchet up renewable use ahead of schedule. "We continue to add renewables to our system, but they have to make sense," Burke said. "It's not really about a target, it's about what makes sense for our customers' usage and what makes rates affordable and what keeps our system reliable." Thirty-two states with renewable standards didn't have, on average, a correlated rate increase, according to Wesley Hersche, an associate director of research with Arizona State University's Global Security Initiative. "These issues involve a complex interaction of factors, and we should be careful not to oversimplify things," Hersche wrote in April.
Says businesses pay roughly 60 percent of taxes in Texas.	As motorists pay more to fill their tanks this Independence Day -- with gas prices at a four-year high for the holiday -- safety advocates are urging caution during celebrations that turn deadly on U.S. roadways. The national average for a gallon of gas on Tuesday stood at $2.86, making it the costliest for an Independence Day holiday in four years, according to AAA. That said, the nearly 40 million motorists expected to travel this week will pay 11 cents less per gallon at the pump than they did this past Memorial Day holiday, the motorist club noted. "The national gas price average has held fairly steady for the past 10 days, suggesting that U.S. demand is keeping pace with supply and stabilizing summer gas prices," a spokesperson for the motorist group said in a statement. "However, elevated crude oil prices and other geopolitical concerns could tilt gas prices more expensive in the early fall despite an expected increase in global crude production from OPEC and its partners."
Health insurance companies pay CEOs $24 million a year	Arunkumar believed that it was critical to investigate quickly. He asked the team to hand-deliver the patient's cerebrospinal fluid, blood, urine and throat swabs to his lab. He received the samples on the morning of May 18. Salih died later that day. Meanwhile, Kozhikode's District Medical Officer Dr. V. Jayasree accompanied a team of local epidemiologists to the family's home in Changaroth.
Every president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt has had fast-track trade authority.	Teddy Roosevelt hopped on whistle stop tour after whistle stop tour where he was able to drop into rural and suburban communities alike to deliver short, pre-packaged speeches that local papers would usually print verbatim. (He left them short on purpose for that very reason.) Franklin Roosevelt revolutionized and heightened the stature of the office with his fireside chats, that brought his message over the heads of the pesky press corps and directly into the living rooms of the American people. But, though it would have been seen as a scoop, even the reporters covering Lyndon B. Johnson had the good sense not to report on every turd he dropped in their presence. While the founders envisioned a government that moved slowly and methodically, today’s Wi-Fi-enabled political discourse is demanding the opposite.
Says Donald Trump wants to deport our Dreamers.	I look very much forward to working with him. There is much to be done that will benefit both the United States and Mexico! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 2, 2018
“I think he’s gonna try and help us with border,” Trump told the reporters. He described “unbelievably bad border laws, immigration laws” in the United States, calling them “the weakest in the world, laughed at by everybody in the world.” He contrasted the U.S. immigration laws with “Mexico’s very strong immigration laws.”
Trump suggested that Mexico can help the United States “until we straighten out our immigration laws, which have been bad for many, many years, decades.” He further assured, “We’re gonna have them taken care of.”

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

LONDON — Over the past century American and British troops have fought side-by-side in two World Wars, Korea and the conflicts in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan. But some lawmakers and experts in the United Kingdom are warning that the British military could soon be seen as irrelevant by the United States unless it receives a colossal funding boost. "There is a concern that the U.K. is falling ever further behind and becoming even more useless from a U.S. point of view," said Andrew Dorman, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a think tank in London.

In the Guardian, Simon Jenkins argues that Theresa May has run out of road and must now face down the Brexit hardliners:
There is no more road. This week the can hits the wall. Theresa May must present her Brussels negotiators with an agreed cabinet template for Brexit, or they, and she, will slither into chaos.
"In France, they have a (surveillance) program a thousandfold more invasive than the United States."	It is a measure of the stakes that even that threat doesn’t guarantee cooperation. At issue is the FBI’s “origin story,” in which it claims its full-fledged investigation into a presidential campaign was conducted, as it were, by the book. According to this narrative, the FBI did not launch its probe until July 31, 2016, only after Australia tipped it to a conversation junior Trump aide George Papadopoulos had with Australian diplomat Alexander Downer in the spring of 2016 in London. Only after this formal commencement of a counterintelligence probe—Crossfire Hurricane—did the FBI begin to target U.S. citizens with spying, wiretapping and other tools usually reserved for foreign infiltrators. Or so the story goes.
"One-half of undocumented workers pay federal income taxes, which means they are paying more federal income taxes than Donald Trump pays."	These numbers are similar to those from a February Quinnipiac poll, where 49 percent of voters said Trump was racist and 46 percent said he was not. Forty-four percent of voters said they think “racist beliefs” were a motive in Trump’s immigration policy, while 50 percent said Trump has “a sincere interest in controlling our borders.” Sixty percent said the policy of separating children from their parents at the border was a violation of human rights. Since enacting the policy, Trump and his associates have repeatedly pushed false, racist narratives to garner support, often associating immigration with high crime rates despite no evidence to support claims that immigrants commit more crime than U.S. citizens. While only 11 percent of Republican voters in the Quinnipiac poll said they think Trump is a racist, 22 percent said they believe Trump has emboldened racist people to express their beliefs publicly. The number of hate crimes rose the year Trump was elected ― the first increase in over a decade.
Last week the Blue Chip Economic Indicators came out that surveys lots of private forecasters. Almost all of them are predicting a turnaround in the third quarter and positive growth in the fourth quarter.	S&P 500 e-minis were down 4.5 points, or 0.16 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 15.5 points, or 0.22 percent. Meanwhile, investors awaited the U.S. jobs data for June, when employers likely maintained a brisk pace of hiring while increasing wages for workers. The Labor Department report, due at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to show nonfarm payrolls increased by 195,000 jobs last month, while average hourly earnings are expected to rise 0.3 percent. Just before the tariff deadline, President Donald Trump upped the ante, warning that the United States may ultimately target over $500 billion worth of Chinese goods, or roughly the total amount of U.S. imports from China last year.
"Since the United States began negotiations with Iran, thats probably the first year and a half in which Iran has not advanced its nuclear program in the last decade."	Experts Skeptical That North Korea Is Serious About Denuclearizing
Enlarge this image toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is heading back to North Korea on Thursday to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and other senior officials. His mission: to flesh out the details of a vaguely worded joint declaration that Kim signed with President Trump in Singapore last month. In that document, the U.S. pledges security guarantees for North Korea, while North Korea commits to "work toward a complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula." There are doubts, though, about how serious Pyongyang is about doing that. After announcing Pompeo's trip to Pyongyang on Monday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders got a barrage of questions about reports that North Korea is expanding sites tied to its nuclear weapons program and that U.S. intelligence officials don't think Kim intends to relinquish his nuclear arsenal.

"Weve got a 1,000 National Guard troop request thats been in front of this president for over a year and no response."	This account of the previously undisclosed conversation comes from a senior administration official familiar with what was said. In an exchange that lasted around five minutes, McMaster and others took turns explaining to Trump how military action could backfire and risk losing hard-won support among Latin American governments to punish President Nicolas Maduro for taking Venezuela down the path of dictatorship, according to the official. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the discussions. Although he gave no indication he was about to order up military plans, he pointed to what he considered past cases of successful gunboat diplomacy in the region, according to the official, like the invasions of Panama and Grenada in the 1980s.
"Under a new law, doctors performing drug-induced abortions could be charged if women dont return to them for follow-up care"	Hope Life Center in western Illinois provides unplanned pregnancy counseling and ultrasounds for about five to 10 women a week, with a mission to “erase abortion from Illinois one woman and one child at time,” according to its website. So Executive Director Debbie Case was alarmed by a change last year in the state's so-called right-of-conscience law, requiring health care providers to inform pregnant patients of all available medical options, including abortion. She said the pregnancy center even shut down for part of 2017 because its physician feared potential repercussions of violating the law, which is now temporarily blocked by the courts. Case and other anti-abortion advocates across the state hailed Tuesday’s ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court against a similar law in California on First Amendment grounds, hoping the decision will strengthen their legal battle in Illinois. “We’re definitely encouraged,” said Case, whose center is in Sterling, about two hours west of Chicago.

Romney adviser admits Romneycare was blueprint for Obamacare.	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”

The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me.	President Donald Trump is not responsible for the killing of journalists in Annapolis last week. His belittling of the press — his “enemy of the American people” taunts, his promises to roll back libel laws, his fomenting rage toward specific journalists at rallies — is worth mentioning within the context of the murders, because it speaks to a larger concern that last Thursday’s attack on The Capital Gazette won’t be an isolated incident. Journalists, many of whom already risk their lives covering war and violence, many of whom receive death threats regularly, feel understandable jitters about a leader who tries to turn the American public against us, particularly when we watch a member of that public shoot up a newsroom and end five lives. It’s reckless and inaccurate, though, to pin the shootings on Trump. The suspect swore an oath to kill a Capital writer who wrote about him in 2011.

Says 11 straight years of no major hurricanes striking land in the United States bores a hole right through the whole climate change argument.	Abbott said on Tuesday night he never conceived of climate change as a moral challenge. “It was an issue, that’s all, and – at least on the actual changes we’ve so far seen – not a very significant one compared to man’s inhumanity to man; maintaining and improving living standards; and even to many other environmental issues such as degraded bush and waterways, particulate pollution, water quality in the third world, deforestation and urban overcrowding.”
He contended that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide from roughly 300 to 400 parts per million over the last century had not triggered “dramatic consequences”. Play Video 0:32 Andrew Probyn calls Tony Abbott 'destructive' in ABC report – video
“Storms are not more severe; droughts are not more prolonged; floods are not greater; and fires are not more intense than a century ago – despite hyperventilating reportage and over-the-top claims from Green politicians,” he said. “Sea levels have hardly risen and temperatures are still below those of the medieval warm period. Over time, temperature change seems to correlate rather more with sun spot activity than with carbon dioxide levels.
"We spend more money on health care per capita in the United States than any other country in the world. Of the 30 developed countries in the world, we spend 2 1/2 times more than the average. Of the country that spends the second most per capita, Switzerland, we spend 175 percent more."	He wroted: "The gift the health service needs is an open, honest, clear-headed diagnosis of its strengths and, yes, its weaknesses, too. That and a national conversation." He highlighted, among other issues, cancer survival rates. It is had to compare figures across the four nations of the UK but international comparisons have suggested that the UK's cancer survival rates do not compare favourably with other countries.

Tsipras, who reached a deal with Skopje last month to end a decades-old dispute over use of the name Macedonia, said there was increasingly “common thinking” among the four leaders on seeing their countries grow together.

"To be absolutely clear: no one at Google reads your Gmail, except in very specific cases where you ask us to and give consent, or where we need to for security purposes, such as investigating a bug or abuse," Frey wrote today. The report, however, comes shortly after Facebook faced a huge PR nightmare when a third party—the now-defunct Cambridge Analytica—got its hands on the data of up to 87 million Facebook users. In that case, a developer ran afoul of Facebook's rules by providing Cambridge Analytica with the info, but as the Journal points out, "Google does little to police [its] developers" in regards to email scanning.

At his state funeral, Trudeau delivered an emotional eulogy that launched him onto the national stage and catalyzed his career in politics. As prime minister, he has crafted a persona as a woke heartthrob. His wrote an essay for Marie Claire about raising boys as feminists and spoke at Davos about sexual harassment as a “systemic issue.” At a U.N. youth event last fall, he lambasted “bro culture” from the stage. “How we treat our sisters, our girlfriends, our cousins, our mothers and the world around us matters,” he said, as the crowd screamed with approval. “The world is changing, the rules are changing, but what they change into and how they change, depends not on leaders in government offices or in businesses, it depends on citizens, it depends on you.”

There are fears that the tariffs will hit US jobs as well. The Trade Partnership, a US-based economics research firm, suggests that the impact will be worse than initially expected, with around 400,000 jobs affected. Companies in industries that use metal, electrical components and construction products will have to pay more for raw materials, and possibly charge more for their work, or cut or move jobs.
David Perdue said hed raise taxes.	In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions.

"In Ohio, we invested in our children, raising school funding by 5.5 percent in the last budget."	'We’re going to run different'
His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.

The list of Democrats expressing frustration with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has been growing longer in recent weeks, but don’t expect to see former President Barack Obama’s name on it. At a party fundraising event Friday afternoon in Northern California, Obama spoke highly of Pelosi – and even predicted that she will return to the job of House speaker after November’s midterm elections. “I think everybody knows how much I love Nancy Pelosi,” Obama told the gathering at a home in affluent Atherton, Politico reported. "Nancy, I believe, is one of the greatest speakers we ever had, and will once again be one of the greatest speakers we ever have after we get through this cycle," he continued. “And there's not much I could have gotten done without having Nancy there alongside of me every step of the way.”

Mitofsky predicted Morena allies would take between 56 and 70 seats in the 128-member Senate and between 256 and 291 spots in the 500-seat lower house. "The anger that the average Mexican feels toward the way things are being governed has favored Lopez Obrador," said Shannon O'Neil, senior fellow for Latin America Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.

Our Founding Fathers resolved that without freedom Americans could not enjoy life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. To secure it, they fought a war to break free from the bonds of tyranny. It isn’t a faraway tyrant that oppresses us today. Rather, we are in the grip of a new kind of tyranny — that of mistrust. This tyrant sits on a throne in our minds and is just as cruel as King George was during the time of the Founders.

For months, polls have given López Obrador, or Amlo as most call him, a 20-point lead over his closest rival, a 39-year-old lawyer and yoga aficionado called Ricardo Anaya. “We can already affirm that Andrés Manuel López Obrador is the next president of the Republic,” Claudia Sheinbaum, a close Amlo ally tipped to become Mexico City’s next mayor, told jubilant fans at his final pre-election rally on Wednesday night. “I am convinced we are standing at the gates of a new era.”
About 100,000 lopezobradoristas had reportedly packed Mexico City’s Azteca Stadium for the rock concert-style jamboree – the final act in a punishing six-month campaign that has seen Amlo repeatedly crisscross Mexico with his promises to wipe out corruption and pump the recovered funds into social projects. “[Corruption] is the main cause of social inequality and economic inequality – and insecurity and violence also stem from corruption,” Amlo, who is making his third bid for the presidency, said in his eve-of-election address. “We will get rid of this corruption, this cancer, that is destroying this country.”

The American people will be appalled to learn the health care bill exempts (congressional) leadership and committee staff.	Straight-A students are being turned away from British medical schools and forced to pay for training in Eastern Europe, while the National Health Service (NHS) plunders the Third World for already-trained doctors instead. The Daily Mail spoke to a number of star students who earned top A-levels and supplemented their CVs with spells volunteering at local GP surgeries, overseas clinics, hospices, and pharmacies — and even earned degrees in related fields such as Biomedical Science — who were turned away from British medical schools, despite the NHS facing a shortfall of some 10,000 doctors. Department of Health and Social Care figures show that only 6,000 of 18,000 medical school applicants were awarded places last year — with many of the 6,000 likely going to foreign applicants, who have often been favoured over British applicants. In fact, the Mail found that so many talented would-be medical students were being rejected that a cottage industry of English-language medical schools in countries such as Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Armenia, and Georgia have sprung up to cater to them — but even this option is not available to youngsters who cannot afford the fees.

While other data on Thursday showed private payrolls rising less than expected last month and a surprise increase in new applications for unemployment benefits last week, overall labor market conditions continue to tighten. The labor market is considered to be near or at full employment, with the jobless rate at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent. The unemployment rate has dropped by three-tenths of a percentage point this year and is near the Federal Reserve’s forecast of 3.6 percent by the end of this year.
"We admit about 100,000 permanent immigrants from the Middle East every year."	Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year.

The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.

"Nearly 14,000 Wisconsinites have lost their job since Governor Walker and the Republicans took over in January."	Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) trashed the June jobs report — even though it showed rapid job growth, rising wages, and low unemployment. The report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that employers created 213,000 new jobs in June — 22,000 more than economists had expected. Manufacturing jobs in particular rose by 36,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.
"Says in the last 20 years, the French have not stood by the United States on foreign policy."	In the lead-up to the upcoming NATO summit in Brussels, President Donald Trump has reportedly sent “sharply worded letters” to the leaders of several NATO allies, escalating his long-simmering feud with the military alliance. The New York Times reported Monday that the letters, sent last month to leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Prime Minister Charles Michel of Belgium, rebuked NATO allies for not spending enough on their own defense ― a criticism that Trump has repeatedly leveled against other alliance members. The president also suggested in the letters that the U.S. would consider reducing its military commitment globally if its allies don’t ramp up spending, reported the Times. In his letter to Merkel, Trump reportedly wrote: “There is growing frustration in the United States that some allies have not stepped up as promised. The United States continues to devote more resources to the defense of Europe when the Continent’s economy, including Germany’s, are doing well and security challenges abound.

One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.

Says Attorney General Loretta Lynch was a member of Bill Clintons defense team during the 1992 Whitewater corruption probe.	The report also said that Strzok repeatedly pushed for more aggressive action in the Clinton probe. "The conduct by these employees cast a cloud over the entire FBI investigation and sowed doubt about the FBI’s work," the report concluded. "The damage caused by these employees’ actions extends far beyond the scope of the (Clinton) investigation and goes to the heart of the FBI’s reputation for neutral fact finding and political independence." Goelman, in an op-ed in USA TODAY last month, said Strzok has become the victim of "political gamesmanship" by Congress and President Trump, who has repeatedly tweeted about Strzok as evidence of bias by the FBI and Justice Department. "They have spent months cynically taking these texts out of context and saying that one- or two-word snippets somehow prove that the FBI investigations of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the Russia probe itself, were biased," Goelman wrote.

"The amount of debt is on pace to double in five years and triple in 10. The federal debt is now over $100,000 per household."	The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.

It has been 536 days since power-sharing in Northern Ireland collapsed - 536 days without ministers to oversee the running of Stormont's nine departments. In the absence of an executive, civil servants were left uncertain about what decisions to take, and who should take them. The long-running court case over the proposed Arc21 waste incinerator in County Antrim raised questions about exactly that conundrum. The judgement upholding a ruling that a senior civil servant did not have the power to act without ministerial approval in the case of the incinerator could have massive implications for future governance in Northern Ireland.

"The Richardson-Denish administration gave 50,000 drivers licenses to illegal immigrants in New Mexico."	Jose Arizmendi, 54, a native of Mexico, pleaded guilty in April 1996 to aggravated sexual assault of a child in the District Court of Harris County, Texas … When the Department of Justice filed a complaint in federal court to initiate denaturalization proceedings in February 2015, Arizmendi was serving an 18-year prison sentence in Mexico for a separate sex offense of rape that he committed in that country.

Between June 2011 and March 2012, Martinez engaged in a scheme in which she impersonated a U.S. immigration officer. Fosia Abdi Adan, 51, a native of Somalia, applied for and received a diversity visa from the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, Yemen, under the Diversity Visa (DV) Program on Jan. 10, 2001, and used her visa to unlawfully obtain beneficiary visas for the below individuals who were ineligible to be beneficiaries.

Following the news of Mr. Pruitt’s resignation, Mr. Dinneen wrote that there was a “collective sigh of relief coming from the Midwest,” calling the 2019 ethanol quotas “the straw that broke the camel’s back.”
While it is too early to say how the handling of waivers or the treatment of E15 may change under new leadership, one indicator was small losses in affected refiners in early Friday trading and gains in most ethanol producers. CVR Refining, Andeavor and Delek U.S. Holdings , all of which benefited from waivers granted by the EPA, had rallied by 136%, 40% and 92% in the year ended Thursday, respectively. Ethanol companies Pacific Ethanol and Green Plains had fallen by 60% and 14%, respectively. Agricultural lobbyists often portray any easing of the rules as a sop to “big oil,” but that isn’t accurate.

He took a short position in shipping company Navigator Holdings worth between $100,001 and $250,000 on Oct. 31, five days after the New York Times contacted him about an article linking Navigator indirectly to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ross told CNBC earlier this week that he also shorted shares in Air Lease and Ocwen Financial. Ross, who plays a key role in increasingly high-stakes trade talks, says those sales were part of divestments made to work in government and he didn’t profit from those transactions. Democratic lawmakers are increasingly concerned, though. Last week, three members of Congress asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate whether Ross violated insider-trading laws.
Christian Pastor in Vermont Sentenced to One Year in Prison After Refusing to Marry Gay Couple	Bishop John Bauerschmidt, who oversees the Middle Tennessee region of the church, stands firmly by his decision not to authorize their use, nor allow clergy within his diocese to officiate the religious ceremonies or permit the weddings on church property. In doing so, the bishop says he is being faithful to his job of guarding the discipline, faith and unity of the church. April 2017: Black female Episcopal bishop of Indy diocese breaks stained glass ceiling
January 2016: Anglicans suspend Episcopal Church over stance on same-sex marriage
July 2015: Episcopalians vote to allow gay marriage in churches
"The teaching that Christian marriage is between a man and a woman is reasonable, traditional, and scriptural," Bauerschmidt said in an email. "There really is nothing remarkable about a Christian bishop who holds to this teaching." While Bishops can place limitations on the use of the marriage liturgies, they must refer couples to a willing diocese if they do not authorize them.
Rhode Island is the only state where officers at state-supported [colleges] carry out their duties unarmed.	“I was defending myself,” Sumpter said during the hearing. Judge John Blawie told Sumpter that he believed his version of events, but had to follow the letter of the law. Under Connecticut law, assault victims cannot use deadly force if they are able to retreat from their attackers. By contrast, 27 states — most notably Florida — have passed so-called “stand-your-ground” laws, which entitle citizens to use force in self-defense if there is a reasonable belief of a threat. The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Says the United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the world.	Those factories are the core of an American operation that employs about 136,000 people, but they're also dependent on components sourced overseas for reasons of cost or availability. About 70 percent of the parts in a U.S.-built Camry, the country's best-selling car, come from domestic suppliers. Toyota on June 27 said that Trump's threatened 25 percent tariff on automotive imports would add $1,800 to the price of each sedan. The carmaker's warning of the dangers of tit-for-tat tariffs was just one of many. German lighting manufacturer Osram Licht's shares plunged 22 percent Thursday after it announced a weaker outlook due to trade tensions.

The law is very clear! 'The monies recouped from the TARP shall be paid into the general fund of the treasury for the reduction of the public debt.'	The new law - approved by 87 votes to 15 in the 120-seat Knesset late on Monday - requires the Israeli government to withhold an amount of tax revenue equal to what is paid by the PA to "individuals who were involved in terror activity against Israelis and their families". If the defence ministry determines that such payments are no longer being made, the frozen funds will be returned to the PA.
Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman hailed the legislation, saying: "An effective war on terrorism also passes through the pocket - of the terrorists, of their families and of [Palestinian Authority President] Mahmoud Abbas." Image copyright AFP Image caption The law's sponsors said the PA's payments were "an expression of support for acts of terror"
But chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat condemned what he called a "very dangerous decision that amounts to the cancellation of the Palestinian Authority and is piracy and theft". The PA's Minister of Prisoner Affairs, Issa Qaraqeh, meanwhile insisted the payments would continue. "When we signed Oslo Agreement, it was clear to Israel that the Palestinian Authority pays these families, and they never objected," he was quoted as saying by the Associated Press.
"Our veterans, in many cases, are being treated worse than illegal immigrants."	Some immigrant U.S. Army reservists and recruits who enlisted in the military with a promised path to citizenship are being abruptly discharged, the Associated Press has learned. The AP was unable to quantify how many men and women who enlisted through the special recruitment program have been booted from the Army, but immigration attorneys say they know of more than 40 who have been discharged or whose status has become questionable, jeopardizing their futures. "It was my dream to serve in the military," said reservist Lucas Calixto, a Brazilian immigrant who filed a lawsuit against the Army last week. "Since this country has been so good to me, I thought it was the least I could do to give back to my adopted country and serve in the United States military." Some of the service members say they were not told why they were being discharged.
Says Paul Ryan tried to change the whole game for Social Security	It was described as a tense meeting, the BBC's Norman Smith said. Mrs May is trying to find an arrangement to unite her cabinet when ministers gather at her country retreat, Chequers, on Friday. The UK is leaving the EU in March 2019, but has yet to agree how it will trade with the remaining EU members - who are part of a single market and a customs union - in years to come. Some former Remain campaigners want the government to pursue close ties to the EU to avoid barriers to trade with Europe - but Eurosceptics say the UK needs freedom to set its own independent trade policy. After two alternative models for customs were criticised, Downing Street has come up with what it calls a "third way" solution to be presented on Friday, claiming it will offer "the best of both worlds" - frictionless trade with Europe and the freedom to strike international trade deals.
"Says Rob Portman was a registered foreign agent whose client was Haiti, at a time when the Baby Doc, Duvalier, who was a despot, was killing people."	Crimes such as robbery remain rampant across Venezuela amid the country’s dire economic and humanitarian crisis, leading growing numbers of people to turn to violence merely to ensure survival. Kidnappings, armed robberies, and violent attacks are now commonplace. Venezuela is widely considered one of the most dangerous destinations in the world. As noted by El Nacional, “There are many travelers who have been stripped of money, luggage, and vehicles on the Caracas-La Guaira highway, especially at night and early morning when the road is little traveled and lacks surveillance.”
The doctors were present in Venezuela as part of an agreement between the two countries. Venezuela typically pays for the doctors in vast quantities of oil, an initiative that started under Hugo Chávez and Fidel Castro.
Recent solar energy policies in Georgia have resulted in rate hikes and did not result in solar becoming any more economically viable.	Because it is also a flood plain, the project’s 989,000 solar panels will be mounted on frames 12ft tall – the height of a double-decker bus. Unlike most solar farms, Cleve Hill Solar Park’s panels will not all face south, but east and west in a continuous zig-zag. The effect, say the scheme’s opponents, will be to turn green meadows into something resembling a colossal factory roof. Economically and environmentally the scheme makes no sense whatsoever. Apart from ruining a huge swathe of countryside and killing or displacing all the local wildlife, it will do little for Britain’s energy needs.

"In 2010, the non-partisan Government Accountability Office found that only 6.5 percent of the U.S.-Mexico border was under full control of the Border Patrol."	The apprehension migrants who illegally cross the U.S. southwestern border between ports of entry fell by 18 percent in June following tougher enforcement actions taken by the Trump Administration. “Following the implementation of the Administration’s zero-tolerance policy, the June 2018 Southwest Border Migration numbers declined by 18 percent when compared to the previous month,” Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Press Secretary Tyler Q. Houlton said in a written statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. “DHS will continue to enforce the rule of law and uphold our nation’s immigration laws as passed by Congress,” Houlton continued. “As we have said before, the journey north is dangerous and puts individuals in the hands of smugglers and traffickers.”
Border Patrol agents arrested 34,114 illegal immigrants between the southwestern border ports of entry, officials stated in the June Southwest Border Migration Report. This number represents a decrease of 6,224 migrants arrested (18 percent).
Not one tax has been raised since Ive been governor.	The budget was the first hard issue on which the governor and Senate president had to work together or face potentially politically catastrophic results. Had they not reached an agreement, thousands of state workers would have been furloughed and state parks and beaches would have shut down. Initially, Murphy wanted a tax on all income over $1 million and a slight increase in the state sales tax to 7 percent from 6.625 percent. Sweeney, who in previous years had supported a millionaire's tax, was now opposed, instead calling for a temporary increase in the corporate business tax. On Saturday morning, about 13 hours before the midnight shutdown deadline, their rhetoric remained heated.
"Demand for transportation choice is on the rise, with 14 percent more Ohioans riding passenger trains over the past year."

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
A poll conducted in Egypt revealed that 80 percent of Egyptians oppose receiving foreign aid from the United States.	The vast majority of swing voters across the United States oppose the Democrats’ latest plan to abolish all immigration enforcement by ending the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. In recent weeks, Democrats in the House and Senate, along with progressive liberals like Cynthia Nixon in New York and most recently insurgent Democrat candidate for Congress, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have been demanding ICE be abolished and all immigration enforcement be ended. House Democrats are now crafting legislation that would officially abolish ICE. The latest Harvard/Harris Poll, though, reveals that swing voters are overwhelmingly opposed to the Democrats’ plan to end all immigration enforcement across the U.S.
Nearly 3-in-4 swing voters, about 73 percent, of swing voters said they do not want ICE to be disbanded. Less than 30 percent of swing voters said they support the abolishment of ICE.
We spend twice as much per capita on health care as any other nation on Earth.	Dec. 7, 2016: Trump announces that Pruitt will be his nominee for EPA administrator
The then-Attorney General of Oklahoma was touted by Trump as having "great qualifications and a good record." Part of that record was Pruitt touting himself as a "leading advocate against the EPA's activist agenda," and his history of challenging the EPA was well known. Feb. 17, 2017: Confirmed by the Senate
Pruitt's confirmation, which was approved with a vote of 52-46, came in the midst of a court order that required him to turn over thousands of communications with major coal, oil and gas companies from his time in office. Democratic senators expressed outrage that Republicans were going ahead as scheduled with the vote on Pruitt, despite the judge’s ruling in the order. March 23, 2017: Defends budget cuts to his agency
The budget plan put forward by the Trump administration proposed cuts 31 percent of the EPA’s funding, including significant reductions to research programs and enforcement of clean air and clean water programs, but that didn’t bother Pruitt.
Says the Texas Education Agency follows up to make sure undocumented immigrants paying in-state tuition at Texas colleges are applying for permanent residency.	As we previously argued in Slate, the administration’s family separations were plainly unconstitutional. The district court agreed, at least for the purposes of a preliminary injunction. Under the orders, children younger than 5 must be reunited with their families within 14 days of the order. The court ruled that children 5 and older must be reunited within 30 days. Reporting since the court issued its order indicates that the government does not intend to abide by the order.

EDITOR'S NOTE: This is a weekly look at the latest developments in the South China Sea, the location of several territorial conflicts that have raised tensions in the region. ———
XI ASSERTS TERRITORIAL CLAIMS IN MEETING WITH US DEFENSE SECRETARY
Chinese President Xi Jinping strongly asserted China's determination to defend territory it claims, including in the South China Sea, in a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. While the tone of Mattis' visit to Beijing was largely upbeat, Xi made sure to reinforce his reputation as a fervent nationalist when it comes to issues of sovereignty. Though Xi gave no specifics in his statement, he was largely seen as indicating the South China Sea as well as self-governing Taiwan. China also claims territory held by India and uninhabited East China Sea islands controlled by Japan.
Hidden in the healthcare.gov code is language that means users waive any reasonable right to privacy of your personal information.	"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.
One of the most recent polls said 75 percent of the American people have said either don't do anything or start over (on health care reform).	“They’ve twisted American values,” she said in a follow-up phone interview. “A lot of them are anti-God, anti-religion and anti-military.”
In the survey, most say they are proud to be Americans, although Republicans feel that way more strongly (90 percent) than Democrats (61 percent). There is no consensus when asked about the country’s current course, though: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. “Overwhelming majorities of those in both parties and independents agree that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.”” USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll
The USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll of 1,004 adults, taken online June 26-27, has a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The survey is one of a year-long series on American values.
Most military experts say there is anywhere between 25 and 30 members of al Qaeda in Afghanistan.	The court documents detail the accounts of four unnamed women, identified as Jane Does 1, 2, 3, and 4. Local reports cited depositions that Large took before his death wherein he reportedly admitted to suggesting some of the women participate in "catfight videos" for money, but he denied the claims of sexual assault. Now his five of his former supervisors, police department, and Horry County officials are facing claims from two of the victims, Jane Does 3 and 4, for allegedly failing to prevent years of egregious abuse. Large died in January, 16 months after he was indicted. On Monday, a judge rejected a motion for summary judgment from the defendants and decided the case would move forward with a trial against the Horry County Police Department and Horry County.
The average American is working through the month of May just to pay off the government.	Small businesses hired workers at a slower pace in June, the second straight month of weakening job gains despite an overall healthy economy. Payroll company ADP said Thursday it counted 29,000 new jobs at its customers with 49 or fewer employees. This marks a decline from small business job gains of 46,000 in May and 50,000 in April. So far this year, small businesses have been creating on average 46,000 jobs a month. ADP reported that overall private employers added 177,00 jobs last month, a slight drop-off from the average this year of 202,667 a month as companies say they're having a tougher time finding skilled workers.
Says Kelly Ayotte stands with the Washington gun lobby. They fund her campaigns.	Republican Senate candidate and Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley launched a new website on Tuesday attacking incumbent Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) for her past and future votes on candidates nominated by President Trump for the Supreme Court. “Claire McCaskill has been wrong on EVERY Supreme Court pick,” the above-the-fold headline on the new www.supremeclaire.com website reads. The web site then notes five facts about McCaskill’s record of supporting President Obama’s Supreme Court nominees, while opposing President Trump’s:
Claire McCaskill has been wrong on the last five Supreme Court nominees. McCaskill opposed conservatives Alito and Gorsuch. McCaskill voted in favor of filibustering Neil Gorsuch.

"In Cranston, it costs $5,000 to $6,000 to send out community notifications on just one Level 3 sex offender."	Practice is only one of Deborah Glass’s 125 recommendations not accepted by Victorian government
Female prisoners in Victoria are still subject to “abusive” routine strip searches, a state government watchdog says. The Victorian ombudsman, Deborah Glass, said the government has failed to adopt a recommendation from her 2015 report into the prison system that called for an end to the searches. “Why has the government not accepted my recommendation to stop the abusive practice of routinely strip-searching women prisoners – in fact, the only recommendation out of 125 not accepted?” she asked on Wednesday. The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year.
"While the countrys economy was battered, nine states with no income tax actually grew jobs from 2001 to 2010."	The U.S. economy continues to show strength in the wake of tax reform and deregulation, but the downside of robust growth is that Donald Trump thinks this means he can dabble at trade war with impunity. He ought to look at the signs that growth would be even stronger if not for his border-tax brawls. The latest evidence came in the minutes released Thursday from the Federal Open Market Committee’s June meeting. Fed district presidents from around the U.S. reported evidence of strong growth, but along the way came this warning:
Foreign Edition Podcast
“However, many District contacts expressed concern about the possible adverse effects of tariffs and other proposed trade restrictions, both domestically and abroad, on future investment activity; contacts in some Districts indicated that plans for capital spending had been scaled back or postponed as a result of uncertainty over trade policy.”
The minutes continued: “Contacts in the steel and aluminum industries expected higher prices as a result of the tariffs on these products but had not planned any new investments to increase capacity. Conditions in the agricultural sector reportedly improved somewhat, but contacts were concerned about the effect of potentially higher tariffs on their exports.”
These reports are from the economy’s ground floor, not the Beltway penthouse.
"The United States is not building the aircraft, the long-range bombers, the additional aircraft carriers, the nuclear submarines."	Many Americans gaze at the sky and see only a vast uncharted frontier for exploration. But President Donald Trump reminds Americans that there’s another potential reality in space: It could become a military battlefield, a place where this nation’s independence is protected or lost. The point isn’t to repel an alien invasion from deep space. We’re not worried about Klingons. But Americans do have reason to be concerned about technologically advancing adversaries here on Earth.
"Every year we spend roughly $500 billion on tax compliance. That is roughly the budget of our entire military, entirely wasted on tax compliance."	The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.
"They say teachers only make on averagein New Jersey 60,000 dollars a year.They only work 180 days."	Hamilton, the Republican state lawmaker who beat the incumbent Karnes, won with a mix of support from teachers and other unions. While Karnes sparred with teachers during the strike, Hamilton took a moderate position. He aligned with teachers unions by opposing state right-to-work legislation and the proposed repeal of prevailing wage laws for public construction projects. The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.
"I can put 10,000 people to work. Electricians, plumbers, sheet metal workers -- by retrofitting all of the state buildings for energy independence or efficiency."	“Sea levels have hardly risen and temperatures are still below those of the medieval warm period. Over time, temperature change seems to correlate rather more with sun spot activity than with carbon dioxide levels. “And even if carbon dioxide, a naturally occurring trace gas that’s necessary for life, really is the main climate change villain, Australia’s contribution to mankind’s emissions is scarcely more than 1%.”
Abbott framed his contribution not as a deliberate wrecking exercise but as an effort to “save” the government. “Far from wrecking the government, MPs worried about energy policy are trying to save it, with a policy that would be different from Labor’s and would give voters the affordable and reliable power they want.”
Exporters are using a federal loophole to deceptively sell products made from cat and dog fur to U.S. consumers.	The definition of drug dealer
More and more, trouble is following fellow drug users, friends and relatives of those dying from overdoses. With the country's opioid crisis widening – having killed more people in 2016, for instance, than the deadliest year of the AIDs epidemic – bystanders to fatal overdoses are increasingly becoming criminal defendants. Pennsylvania prosecutors in Delaware County who are pursuing the case against Santa Barbara declined an interview request. But among the criminal charges they are pressing against her is drug delivery resulting in death, a first-degree felony carrying the maximum punishment of 20 to 40 years in prison. In Pennsylvania, the number of people charged with this version of third-degree murder from an accidental overdose went from 15 in 2013 to 205 last year.

BREAKING ... ABC NEWS' GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS SPOKE TO MICHAEL COHEN: "Michael Cohen says family and country, not President Trump, is his 'first loyalty'": "When I asked Cohen directly what he would do if prosecutors forced him to choose between protecting the president and protecting his family, he said his family is 'my first priority.' "Cohen added: 'Once I understand what charges might be filed against me, if any at all, I will defer to my new counsel, Guy Petrillo, for guidance.' Story Continued Below
"But when I pointed out to Cohen that he wasn’t repeating past vows to 'take a bullet' and 'do anything' to protect the president, the longtime Trump loyalist left little doubt about where he stands now, saying simply: 'To be crystal clear, my wife, my daughter and my son, and this country have my first loyalty.'

Scott Pruitt has resigned as head of the Environmental Protection Agency after a string of controversies involving his leadership, President Trump announced Thursday on Twitter. "Within the Agency Scott has done an outstanding job, and I will always be thankful to him for this," tweeted Trump, who added that EPA Deputy Administrator Andrew Wheeler would take over as acting administrator effective Monday. "I have no doubt that Andy will continue on with our great and lasting EPA agenda," Trump concluded. "We have made tremendous progress and the future of the EPA is very bright!" In his resignation letter to Trump, Pruitt said: "It is extremely difficult for me to cease serving you in this role first because I count it a blessing to be serving you in any capacity, but also, because of the transformative work that is occurring.

Araceli Martinez aka Maria Araceli Ramos de Martinez, 53, a native of Mexico, pleaded guilty in September 2012 to Obtaining Money, Labor or Property by False Pretense in violation of California Penal Code § 532(a) in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles. Between June 2011 and March 2012, Martinez engaged in a scheme in which she impersonated a U.S. immigration officer. Fosia Abdi Adan, 51, a native of Somalia, applied for and received a diversity visa from the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, Yemen, under the Diversity Visa (DV) Program on Jan. 10, 2001, and used her visa to unlawfully obtain beneficiary visas for the below individuals who were ineligible to be beneficiaries. Adan arrived and was admitted to the United States on Jan. 29, 2001, on her diversity immigrant visa as a permanent resident.
We are one of only two states to have eight consecutive months of declining unemployment. Twenty-one states had increased unemployment last month. Ours went down.

While other data on Thursday showed private payrolls rising less than expected last month and a surprise increase in new applications for unemployment benefits last week, overall labor market conditions continue to tighten. The labor market is considered to be near or at full employment, with the jobless rate at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent. The unemployment rate has dropped by three-tenths of a percentage point this year and is near the Federal Reserve’s forecast of 3.6 percent by the end of this year.
"Barack Obama wants to ""unilaterally disarm our nation."""	But North Korea still prefers a step-by-step disarmament process with reciprocal concessions and benefits from the United States for each of the North's denuclearization steps. The ultimate rewards North Korea wants range from the easing or lifting of American-led international sanctions, the signing of a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, the establishment of diplomatic ties and the pulling out of U.S. troops in South Korea, experts say. During Pompeo's visit, North Korea is expected to ask the United States to consider signing a peace treaty to prolong a peace mood and find ways to seek sanctions relief, Go said. Whatever U.S. concessions and rewards North Korea gets, however, some experts say North Korea will likely push to scrap only some of its nuclear capability, not all. They believe North Korea thinks Trump would settle for a partial denuclearization deal to avoid a total failure in his North Korea policy in the face of political woes at home.

Rob Cornilles has disputed for two years a news story that said he said he would cut Social Security and Medicare programs before trimming the U.S. defense budget.	He had a small team of allies and has built his political life with them. The big exception was during this election he realized astutely that no one can win by himself. He has built a large coalition that includes a far-right party completely opposed to progressive politics. He has done so because he needed them to win. How will he behave toward those members of his very odd coalition is anyone’s guess.
Says Texas Railroad Commissioner Michael Williams has attended more than 150 tea party gatherings.	Alaa al-Dweri, who repairs motorcycles, described a doomsday scenario playing out in his town of Busra al-Harir, as livestock roamed the streets and families drove to safety in packed cars. Dweri, who doesn’t own a car, managed to get his wife, three children and a few small bags on his motorbike. The family of five headed for Tal Shihab,near Quneitra province, and are staying at a home belonging to friends. “I wish I could have helped other families to escape, but unfortunately I only have this motorbike,” he says.
Harry Reid has voted to give special tax breaks to illegal aliens.	As well as a new president, Mexican will be voting for 128 senators and 500 deputies in Congress as well as state and local officials. In all, 88 million people will be eligible to vote. Mexico is the second largest economy in Latin America and a major oil exporter. However, oil prices have dropped and the Mexican currency, the peso, has fallen sharply against the dollar. More than 40% of the population lives in poverty and high levels of corruption and violence have led some companies to pull out of the worst affected areas.
Job growth in the United States is now at the fastest pace in this countrys history.	The services sector, where most Americans are employed, has now expanded for 101 consecutive months, or more than eight years. The gain was better than many economists had been expecting and depicts an overall economy that appears to be regaining momentum after a slowdown in the winter.

Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey has apologised to Parliament for making "inadvertently misleading" statements about Universal Credit. She said she had "mistakenly" told MPs on Monday the National Audit Office felt the benefit was progressing too slowly and should be rolled out faster. The head of the spending watchdog had said the claims were "incorrect" as it had reservations about the process. Labour had called on Ms McVey to apologise or "consider her position". Ms McVey told MPs that she had meant to say that the spending watchdog believed there was "no practical alternative" to the development of Universal Credit, which rolls six benefits into one.
Atlanta has issued an increasing number of citations - and collected an increasing amount of revenue - since Mayor Kasim Reed took office in 2010.	That came on the heels of 0.9 percent drop in March, the first monthly drop since July of 2017. Total private construction rose 0.3 percent, with residential projects up 0.8 percent in May. New single-family home construction rose 0.6 percent and the volatile apartment building sector jumped 1.6 percent. Private, non-residential building fell 0.3 percent. Economists are forecasting that construction spending will contribute to overall growth this year even though interest rates are rising.
Says he was known as Veto Corleone for cutting spending as Florida governor.	Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
The last time Republican U.S. Senate candidates beat more than two (incumbents) was 1980.	“He beat all 15 of those candidates that he faced (crushed many).”
To those that claim that only a traditional politician with "experience" can beat Trump, go back & look at the results from 2016. He beat all 15 of those candidates that he faced (crushed many).

The State of Rhode Island has the worst state-funded pension in the country.	The liberal high school teacher ousted a 24-year incumbent who served as House majority leader in 2016.

About four years ago, Dais had lined up a Chinese company to help develop its business in nanotechnology that helps produce clean water. Tangredi said the Chinese company persuaded a long-time Dais employee to defect with trade secrets. "They just stole it, and they are using it against us," he said. Tangredi said he hopes the threat of a trade war will force China to rethink its practices: "You've got to do something to get their attention."

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.

I've cast a couple of 99-1 votes and been the lone dissenter.	Though they won’t admit it, Democrats are suffering continued fallout from the arrogance of the Obama White House. Liberals are furious that President Trump will have the opportunity to appoint another justice to the Supreme Court, thus cementing a conservative majority for the foreseeable future. Moreover, liberals are upset that the Trump administration may have convinced Justice Anthony Kennedy to recently announce his retirement, viewing that effort as dirty pool. That Kennedy, age 81, is nobody’s fool – and is unlikely to have been manipulated – appears irrelevant. The real offense, which actually merits outrage from the left, is that President Obama did not convince liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to retire during the many years that Democrats controlled the Senate.
Says hes never asked for more than inflationary budget increases in his 10 budgets as Milwaukee County sheriff	Did he display these tendencies? He was a fairly good mayor.

"Under New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, homicides are up by 20 percent, and subway delays have soared 45 percent."	On this much police and activist South Side priest Michael Pfleger can agree: Saturday morning’s anti-violence march on the Dan Ryan Expressway is all about danger. Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.
And delivered more tax relief than the other Republicans combined.	3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.

#GradInsurance debacle is a DIRECT result of #ObamaCare. #MIZZOU has to break the law to do the right thing.	Part of its mission is to provide local veterans with a monthly ration of what he calls medical-grade cannabis free of charge. It started back in 2011.

The rally began with the prayer group’s permitted march from Portland’s Terry Schrunk Federal Plaza. The event was organized by activist Joey Gibson, a U.S. Senate candidate for Washington and leader of Patriot Prayer. The AntiFa group organized some distance away but not before police seized weapons such as utility knives, clubs and chemical sprays, according to The Oregonian. Despite the confiscations, the AntiFa group initiated hostilities by throwing eggs, bottles, and other items at the Patriot group, the paper noted.

We look at other parts of the world, where women are not allowed to vote, or dance, and we see ourselves as modern and liberated.

Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted.

On running for the presidency in 2012	Ethiopia's government has fired five prison officials as it confronts allegations of torture and other abuses of inmates as part of a wave of reforms. Among those fired is the federal prison chief who until recently defended the treatment of inmates as "fair." The firings came ahead of a new Human Rights Watch report released Thursday that documents widespread arbitrary detention, torture, rape and humiliation over several years in Ethiopia's eastern Somali region. It urges new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to investigate the "horrific" situation. Abiy has admitted that security forces have tortured people but has yet to "tackle Ethiopia's culture of impunity and ensure accountability," said Felix Horne, senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch.

(Reuters) - A man went on a stabbing spree at a 3-year-old’s birthday party at an apartment complex housing refugee families in Boise on Saturday, injuring nine people, including six children, police said on Sunday. Timmy Kinner, a 30-year-old from Los Angeles who had been staying at the complex, has been arrested, Boise police said. He is not an immigrant and went on the rampage a day after being asked to leave by one of the residents, police said. Kinner was being held without bail at the Ada County jail on 15 charges, including six of injury to a child and nine of aggravated battery, jail records showed. There was no lawyer listed for Kinner in the records.

Eric Young, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees’ Council of Prison Locals, now prays before he looks at his phone every morning, worried he’ll receive a message from BOP’s director notifying him of a staff death. Young estimates that around two-thirds of his union members were Trump supporters. That makes sense: It’s a law enforcement agency that leans white and male (72 percent male, 62 percent white), and many federal prisons are in rural parts of the country, which Trump dominated. But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau. BOP has long suffered the kind of problems you’d expect for a massive bureaucracy centered on caging tens of thousands of people.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images
For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.

Legalize the possession and sale of up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana for personal, recreational use for people over the age of 21. A person could keep up to 10 ounces of marijuana at home. Tax marijuana sales with a 10 percent excise tax at the retail level as well as the state's 6 percent sales tax. Split those revenues, with 35 percent going to K-12 education, 35 percent to roads, 15 percent to the communities that allow marijuana businesses in their communities and 15 percent to counties where marijuana business are located. Allow communities to decide whether they’ll allow marijuana businesses in their towns.
Pat Toomey still supports privatizing Social Security.	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.

Barack Obama voted against born alive legislation in Illinois that was virtually identical to the federal law.	The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks picked up 1.1 percent to 1,679.48. Benchmark U.S. crude added 9 cents to $73.03 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract plunged $1.20, or 1.6 percent, to settle at $72.94 per barrel Thursday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 14 cents to $77.25 per barrel in London. It slid 85 cents, or 1.1 percent, to close at $77.39 per barrel on Thursday.
"Says Trump shirts are made in Bangladesh, Trump suits in Mexico, Trump Vodka in the Netherlands, Trump crystal barware in Slovenia and his cufflinks and ties in China."	Trump hailed the construction of a plant he said would be "the 8th wonder of the world" as an endorsement of his policies. "We have a lot of things going in the United States," he said. But not far is the headquarters of one of the first American casualties of Trump's trade war -- Harley-Davidson. The legendary motorcycle maker says it's having to move more manufacturing overseas as a result of retaliatory EU tariffs, a decision that surprised Trump. "I've done so much for you, and then this," the president tweeted.
Says President Barack Obama has opened up no new trade relationships with other nations.	Harley-Davidson responded by saying it would shift production of motorbikes for the EU market out of the US. A different president might have seen this as a warning of the collateral damage likely to be caused to the US economy from a trade war, but not this one. In phase two, Trump says he will target $200bn of Chinese goods and is threatening to put a 20% duty on automotive imports from Europe. Both will inevitably provoke tit-for-tat retaliation. The White House has already signalled what phase three of the programme will involve: new investment restrictions on Chinese firms in an attempt to stop intellectual property theft; and the US leaving the World Trade Organisation on the grounds that the Geneva-based body was designed by the rest of the world to screw America.
Says taxpayer subsidy for the Oregon Convention Center hotel jumped $100 million in closed-door sessions	Even Pruitt’s own staff had begun to sour on him, with many worrying that their future career prospects would be damaged by their association with Pruitt’s tenure. Each scandal seemed more damning than the last. Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.

It’s not strictly true to say everyone is against the three huge plant-forested glass spheres at what Amazon calls its “campus” in the heart of the city. The Bezos balls, as the conservatories are popularly known, are modelled on the greenhouses at London’s Kew Gardens, feature walkways above fig trees, ferns and rhododendrons, and provide hot-desking for Amazon workers looking for a break from the neighbouring office tower.

"(Jeb) Bush, not the State of Florida, decided which private emails to disclose."	Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. Federal prosecutors on Tuesday publicly debunked conspiracy theories pushed by President Donald Trump and right-wing media that a former Democratic aide charged with bank fraud was actually a foreign spy trying to steal government secrets. In a plea deal with Imran Awan, who worked as an information technology aide for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., and other Democratic lawmakers, prosecutors said they had conducted "a thorough investigation" into claims that Awan stole information from government servers on behalf of another country while working for House Democrats, but reported that they found no evidence to support the conspiracy theories. "The Government agrees that the public allegations that (Awan) stole U.S. House of Representatives equipment and engaged in unauthorized or illegal conduct involving House computer systems do not form the basis of any conduct relevant to the determination of the sentence in this case," prosecutors said.
History tells us that job growth always lags behind economic growth.	NEW YORK (Reuters) - A woman who scaled the Statue of Liberty’s stone pedestal was snatched by police officers and lowered to safety on Wednesday, ending a standoff that led to the evacuation of the New York Harbor landmark on Independence Day. Authorities could not confirm whether the woman was part of a group of protesters who had earlier unfurled a banner that read “Abolish ICE” from the base of the statue in a protest against U.S. immigration policy. Television images showed two helmeted officers, outfitted in harnesses and ropes, slowly approaching the woman and grabbing her as she clung to the sloping side of the giant statue near its upturned right foot. Minutes before, she had removed her pink athletic shoes and attempted unsuccessfully to scale Lady Liberty’s green-tarnished robes as the dark waters of the Hudson River swirled below. “She’s been taken into custody amicably, peacefully without any injuries, or injuries to our officers, thank God.
Bill Howell has been the consistent force behind every major tax increase in Virginia in the last decade.	Three of the teens were named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit. Howard told U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Dillon during a status conference Tuesday that all three original plaintiffs are no longer part of the case. But he said another teen "is anxious to participate in the case" and will be named as a new plaintiff. "We believe that his allegations with respect to his experience at the facility are sufficiently analogous ... to those of John Does Nos. 1, 2 and 3," Howard said.

Freshman Rep. Moira Jayne Walsh, 27, who has been outspoken about what she sees as a culture of corruption in the State House, lost her party's endorsement to Michael Earnheart, who voted for President Donald Trump. As a safe blue state, Rhode Island rarely gets any national political attention. But Walsh woke up Tuesday to donations from as far away as Texas and California. Party officials describe Earnheart as a "lifelong Democrat" who voted for Trump because he didn’t like Hillary Clinton.
President Obama is attacking Paul Ryan on Medicare even though it is his administration with the help of Jim Langevin who cut $716 billion from Medicare.	"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.

Trump’s campaign to limit legal and illegal immigration is driving up wages and salaries for Americans in various locations and careers around the country. The beneficiaries include new employees, African-American bakers in Chicago, Latino restaurant workers in Monterey, Calif., disabled people nationwide, high schoolers, resort workers in Hilton Head, construction workers, Superbowl workers, the garment industry, and workers at small businesses, and even Warren Buffett’s railroad workers. Amnesty advocates rely on business-funded “Nation of Immigrants” push-polls to show apparent voter support for immigration and immigrants. But “choice” polls reveal most voters’ often-ignored preference that CEOs should hire Americans at decent wages before hiring migrants.
"Obama says Iran is a 'tiny' country, 'doesn't pose a serious threat.'"	President Trump has just said in the past week he's going to raise things like Syria, like Ukraine, like the election meddling issue, really the whole range of issues between us. And I think that, in the president's mind, this is very important, because it gives him an opportunity to size up Vladimir Putin, to see where there are areas where we might make progress together and where there are areas where we may not. BRENNAN: Well, right now, Russia is blanket-bombing Southern Syria. That violates the last agreement Vladimir Putin made with President Trump. Why would he believe that he's in any way trustworthy?
Barbara Boxers worried about the weather instead of terrorism as the biggest threat to national security.	Many Americans gaze at the sky and see only a vast uncharted frontier for exploration. But President Donald Trump reminds Americans that there’s another potential reality in space: It could become a military battlefield, a place where this nation’s independence is protected or lost. The point isn’t to repel an alien invasion from deep space. We’re not worried about Klingons. But Americans do have reason to be concerned about technologically advancing adversaries here on Earth.

For the eighth straight quarter, Fox was the most-watched network in all of cable. With an average of 1.409 million total day viewers, Fox attracted nearly as many eyeballs as MSNBC and CNN combined. MSNBC averaged just 930,000 viewers, while CNN nosedived with an average of just 658,000. During primetime, Fox snagged an average of 2.447 million viewers, compared to MSNBC’s 1.736 million.
"In the 2014 elections, the American people overwhelmingly said we dont want Obamacare and we dont want amnesty."	The vast majority of swing voters across the United States oppose the Democrats’ latest plan to abolish all immigration enforcement by ending the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. In recent weeks, Democrats in the House and Senate, along with progressive liberals like Cynthia Nixon in New York and most recently insurgent Democrat candidate for Congress, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have been demanding ICE be abolished and all immigration enforcement be ended. House Democrats are now crafting legislation that would officially abolish ICE. The latest Harvard/Harris Poll, though, reveals that swing voters are overwhelmingly opposed to the Democrats’ plan to end all immigration enforcement across the U.S.
Nearly 3-in-4 swing voters, about 73 percent, of swing voters said they do not want ICE to be disbanded. Less than 30 percent of swing voters said they support the abolishment of ICE.
Dan Patrick got caught not paying his taxes and pocketed his employees payroll taxes.	They include the United States withdrawing its 28,500 troops in South Korea, ending its military drills with South Korea and stop bringing in strategic assets such as aircraft carriers and nuclear-capable bombers. North Korea hasn't repeated such specific demands since entering disarmament talks earlier this year, raising optimism that the country truly appeared to seek to improve ties with the United States. After the summit, Trump suspended annual military training with South Korea that the North has called an invasion rehearsal. But North Korea still prefers a step-by-step disarmament process with reciprocal concessions and benefits from the United States for each of the North's denuclearization steps. The ultimate rewards North Korea wants range from the easing or lifting of American-led international sanctions, the signing of a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, the establishment of diplomatic ties and the pulling out of U.S. troops in South Korea, experts say.
Says Merrick Garland authored an opinion that resulted in the release of 17 Guantanamo Bay prisoners who were part of a group of violent Islamist extremists the State Department had designated as terrorists.	NEW YORK — House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) has referred 15 individuals, including longtime Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal, for possible “open setting” testimony in the ongoing Russia investigation. The list was sent to House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA). Many of the names are tied to the discredited anti-Trump dossier produced by the controversial Fusion GPS firm, which was paid for its dossier work by both Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) via the Perkins Coie lawfirm. Indeed, Perkins Coie attorney Marc E. Elias, who reportedly was involved in arranging the payments that resulted in the dossier, made the Nunes list. As did Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson.

In the survey, most say they are proud to be Americans, although Republicans feel that way more strongly (90 percent) than Democrats (61 percent).

Letting the Bush tax cuts expire would raise taxes on small businesses.	The latest high-level departure from President Donald Trump's Cabinet was not the most unexpected departure that has faced the administration. Scott Pruitt, the administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency, came under fire multiple times during his tenure over questionable finances, including both excessive spending and sweetheart deals that helped him spend less than expected. Here's a review of his time in office. Dec. 7, 2016: Trump announces that Pruitt will be his nominee for EPA administrator
The then-Attorney General of Oklahoma was touted by Trump as having "great qualifications and a good record." Part of that record was Pruitt touting himself as a "leading advocate against the EPA's activist agenda," and his history of challenging the EPA was well known.

The Republican senator, a supporter of abortion rights, said Roe v. Wade is settled law that has been established as a constitutional right. "A candidate who would overturn Roe would not be acceptable," she said. Collins added that she urged the president to expand the list of people he is considering for the high court beyond his initial 25 names. She said there are people on the list she could not support because she believes they have demonstrated a disrespect for stare decisis, which is the Latin phrase for judicial precedent.

Meanwhile, investors awaited the U.S. jobs data for June, when employers likely maintained a brisk pace of hiring while increasing wages for workers. The Labor Department report, due at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to show nonfarm payrolls increased by 195,000 jobs last month, while average hourly earnings are expected to rise 0.3 percent. Just before the tariff deadline, President Donald Trump upped the ante, warning that the United States may ultimately target over $500 billion worth of Chinese goods, or roughly the total amount of U.S. imports from China last year.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
"Obama ""basically threatened to bomb Pakistan."""	In the lead-up to the upcoming NATO summit in Brussels, President Donald Trump has reportedly sent “sharply worded letters” to the leaders of several NATO allies, escalating his long-simmering feud with the military alliance. The New York Times reported Monday that the letters, sent last month to leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Prime Minister Charles Michel of Belgium, rebuked NATO allies for not spending enough on their own defense ― a criticism that Trump has repeatedly leveled against other alliance members. The president also suggested in the letters that the U.S. would consider reducing its military commitment globally if its allies don’t ramp up spending, reported the Times. In his letter to Merkel, Trump reportedly wrote: “There is growing frustration in the United States that some allies have not stepped up as promised. The United States continues to devote more resources to the defense of Europe when the Continent’s economy, including Germany’s, are doing well and security challenges abound.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
Ohio has lost more population than every other state in the country except for two.	Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.

His belittling of the press — his “enemy of the American people” taunts, his promises to roll back libel laws, his fomenting rage toward specific journalists at rallies — is worth mentioning within the context of the murders, because it speaks to a larger concern that last Thursday’s attack on The Capital Gazette won’t be an isolated incident. Journalists, many of whom already risk their lives covering war and violence, many of whom receive death threats regularly, feel understandable jitters about a leader who tries to turn the American public against us, particularly when we watch a member of that public shoot up a newsroom and end five lives. It’s reckless and inaccurate, though, to pin the shootings on Trump. The suspect swore an oath to kill a Capital writer who wrote about him in 2011.

And those with repeated violations can get into even more trouble with their local health departments, said Hedberg. Those eateries will be flagged by inspectors, who bring copies of previous reports on their visits and can spot patterns of regulation flouting. How repeat offenses are handled differs by jurisdiction. “It’s very rare to see a perfect score,” he said.

Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.

As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.
"Says the difference between her and Barack Obama is ""about 35 years of experience."""	The list of Democrats expressing frustration with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has been growing longer in recent weeks, but don’t expect to see former President Barack Obama’s name on it. At a party fundraising event Friday afternoon in Northern California, Obama spoke highly of Pelosi – and even predicted that she will return to the job of House speaker after November’s midterm elections. “I think everybody knows how much I love Nancy Pelosi,” Obama told the gathering at a home in affluent Atherton, Politico reported. "Nancy, I believe, is one of the greatest speakers we ever had, and will once again be one of the greatest speakers we ever have after we get through this cycle," he continued. “And there's not much I could have gotten done without having Nancy there alongside of me every step of the way.”

22 veterans take their own lives each day.	Watts was transported to a nearby hospital, where 85 to 90 percent of his body was found to have been burned, Georgia State Patrol told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Authorities said Watts, upset with the federal agency designated to aid veterans, attached a homemade incendiary device and fireworks to his body before pouring liquid on himself. He then ignited the fluid. VETERAN PROTESTING TREATMENT BY VA SETS HIMSELF ON FIRE NEAR GEORGIA STATE CAPITOL, POLICE SAY
"It looks like a veteran that was disgruntled with the VA did a personal protest in front of the Capitol which involved gasoline and some fireworks,” Commissioner Mark McDonough, of the Georgia Department of Public Safety, said. The commissioner added a Capitol trooper "actually put him out with his fire extinguisher."
"The United States is the only major country on earth that doesnt guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege."	The Mental Health Act needs to be updated because too many people are being detained in hospital and doctors are becoming increasingly risk-averse, the president of the supreme court has said. In a speech to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, Lady Hale acknowledged that judges themselves may have contributed to a “culture of blame, shame and fear.”
Last year the government set up an independent review of the Mental Health Act owing to concerns about rising rates of detention and the disproportionately large number of people from minority ethnic backgrounds who are sectioned. Hale said many people were not receiving sufficient care in the community to prevent them from reaching crisis point and there was confusion about legal overlaps with the Mental Capacity Act. Over the last 10 years, detentions in England have risen by 47% – from 43,000 in 2005/6 to 63,500 in 2015/16,” she said.
Said former U.S. Ambassador to Kenya Scott Gration was forced to resign two years ago because of his personal use of emails.	"We have made tremendous progress and the future of the EPA is very bright!" In his resignation letter to Trump, Pruitt said: "It is extremely difficult for me to cease serving you in this role first because I count it a blessing to be serving you in any capacity, but also, because of the transformative work that is occurring. "However, the unrelenting attacks on me personally [and] my family, are unprecedented and have taken a sizable toll on all of us," Pruitt added. Pruitt resigned less than a week after The New York Times reported that the EPA's chief ethics official, Kevin Minoli, had been pushing for a series of independent investigation into several aspects of Pruitt's tenure. Those include Pruitt's rental of a Washington D.C. condominium for $50 per day from the spouse of a prominent fossil fuel lobbyist and his alleged use of staff to handle personal matters.
Says Florida is a model for successful pretrial release programs.	Practice is only one of Deborah Glass’s 125 recommendations not accepted by Victorian government
Female prisoners in Victoria are still subject to “abusive” routine strip searches, a state government watchdog says. The Victorian ombudsman, Deborah Glass, said the government has failed to adopt a recommendation from her 2015 report into the prison system that called for an end to the searches. “Why has the government not accepted my recommendation to stop the abusive practice of routinely strip-searching women prisoners – in fact, the only recommendation out of 125 not accepted?” she asked on Wednesday. The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year.

The Labour leader has said the result of the 2016 vote should be respected, but his frontbenchers have been careful not to explicitly rule out a second referendum if the circumstances change. Earlier in the day, Len McCluskey, Unite’s general secretary, said May’s government had lost all authority or capacity to make decisions. “We are not, I repeat for my friends in the media, not, calling for a second referendum … But we remain open to the possibility of a vote on any deal the Tories come back with,” he said. “These people see in Brexit the chance to turn Britain into the low-wage, deregulated, race-to-the-bottom society of their dreams. But Brexit is turning into a nightmare for the rest of us – a nightmare of uncertainty above all.
Redistribution has never been a characteristic of America.	The use of robots to commune with people with Alzheimer’s opens up a whole box of moral quandaries, not least the prospect of some cognitive threshold beneath which patients will be pushed into the arms of machines, rather than humans. It is worth remembering too that like the digital “assistants” now entering people’s homes, Pepper and the current robo-carers do not offer anything approaching the nuances and complexities of genuine human interchange, rather an app store version that most people would consider a matter of erratic entertainment rather than a day-do-day necessity. But as and when robots manage to convincingly perform as make-believe humans, what then? Paradoxically, key voices in the tech world have long believed that as automation sweeps through large swathes of the economy, with the right fiscal adjustments, it will increase the numbers of human caregivers, and elevate them above the low-paid parts of the labour market where such roles are currently concentrated. Last year, for example, a writer in Wired magazine said that such roles as “companions to the elderly, home health aides, babysitters, special-needs aides, and more” demanded to be taken more seriously, and that “the riches resulting from increased automation … could be used to help fund caregiving programs”.

Said they reached a power-sharing agreement with Republican Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle	One participant said she didn't know, so the moderator asked for a show of hands. Few of them went up in the air. Fallon, who runs Demand Justice, said women in that focus group got more motivated once they understood that Kennedy was considered the high court's swing vote on abortion rights. Chris Kang, the chief counsel for Demand Justice, helped President Obama usher his Supreme Court picks through the Senate. He said Democrats tend to operate in issue silos, with people organizing around reproductive rights or issues related to lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender peoples' rights.
Says between 6 and 20 bicycles can be parked in the space required by one car.	It is Trump’s responsibility, however, to help the nation heal in the aftermath. So it’s important that he reversed course Tuesday and called for the lowering of American flags in honor of the five victims. Trump initially rebuffed Annapolis Mayor Gavin Buckley’s request over the weekend to lower flags to half-staff. READ MORE: In a time of hate, your civility lectures aren't helping anyone »

I unsealed my records at Marquette University.	In some offices, dictation is automated into reports through voice recognition software, but this is an imperfect practice and often requires additional double-checking by a real human. Something that seems like a minor error — a misspelling, for example — can have consequences if that record is ever pulled as part of a malpractice suit. It can also mislead a future provider, influence how the office’s service is coded and therefore billed, or even confuse or mislead the patient when he or she is reviewing records. Doctors are human too, and they often dictate late at night after long shifts. Mistakes they didn’t make during a surgery can occur in the retelling of it.

Freshman Rep. Moira Jayne Walsh, 27, who has been outspoken about what she sees as a culture of corruption in the State House, lost her party's endorsement to Michael Earnheart, who voted for President Donald Trump. As a safe blue state, Rhode Island rarely gets any national political attention. But Walsh woke up Tuesday to donations from as far away as Texas and California. Party officials describe Earnheart as a "lifelong Democrat" who voted for Trump because he didn’t like Hillary Clinton.
"The U.S. gives foreign aid to Cuba and Venezuela, even though those countries are our enemies."	But critics say it also underscores how his "America First" foreign policy at times can seem outright reckless, providing ammunition to America's adversaries. The White House declined to comment on the private conversations. But a National Security Council spokesman reiterated that the U.S. will consider all options at its disposal to help restore Venezuela's democracy and bring stability. Under Trump's leadership, the U.S., Canada and European Union have levied sanctions on dozens of top Venezuelan officials, including Maduro himself, over allegations of corruption, drug trafficking and human rights abuses. The U.S. has also distributed more than $30 million to help Venezuela's neighbors absorb an influx of more than 1 million migrants who have fled the country.
Says Texas wildfires are linked to climate change.	Abbott said on Tuesday night he never conceived of climate change as a moral challenge. “It was an issue, that’s all, and – at least on the actual changes we’ve so far seen – not a very significant one compared to man’s inhumanity to man; maintaining and improving living standards; and even to many other environmental issues such as degraded bush and waterways, particulate pollution, water quality in the third world, deforestation and urban overcrowding.”
He contended that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide from roughly 300 to 400 parts per million over the last century had not triggered “dramatic consequences”. Play Video 0:32 Andrew Probyn calls Tony Abbott 'destructive' in ABC report – video
“Storms are not more severe; droughts are not more prolonged; floods are not greater; and fires are not more intense than a century ago – despite hyperventilating reportage and over-the-top claims from Green politicians,” he said. “Sea levels have hardly risen and temperatures are still below those of the medieval warm period. Over time, temperature change seems to correlate rather more with sun spot activity than with carbon dioxide levels.

He said contracts obtained under energy reforms passed under President Enrique Pena Nieto will be scrutinized for any corruption or illegality, but otherwise contracts will be honored. "There will be no confiscation or expropriation of assets. ... Eradicating corruption will be the principal mission," he said. Lopez Obrador also spoke of reducing Mexican immigration to the United States through economic development. "Mexicans will be able ... to work and be happy where they were born," he said.
"Earlier this year, [John DePetro] was accused of sexually assaulting a female co-worker."	Hill denied the allegations in an emailed statement to IndyStar. Details of the accusations are outlined in a confidential June 18 memorandum prepared by the Taft Stettinius & Hollister law firm at the request of legislative leaders.

"Photo of ""tea party"" protests shows crowd sprawling from Capitol to Washington Monument"	PORTLAND, Ore. -- Two opposing protest groups -- Patriot Prayer and antifa -- clashed in downtown Portland Saturday, CBS Portland affiliate KOIN reports. Portland police said failure to leave the area could leave to arrests, calling the demonstration a riot. More than 100 members of Patriot Prayer group gathered at Terry Schrunk Plaza for a "freedom rally," while more than 100 counter protesters with an antifa group gathered across the street at Chapman Square for rallies before a march. Police revoked Patriot Prayer's permit for the rally after the two groups began to clash. People were lighting firecrackers and smoke bombs in the crowd while police used flash bangs in an effort to disperse the clashing protesters.

Speaking shortly after the assault on Saturday, Boise Police Chief William Bones said it was "a single evil individual who attacked people with no provocation that we are aware of."
I earned more votes in the state of Wisconsin than Donald Trump did in New York.	A few days after Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., commented on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's upset victory, other established figures in the party voiced concerns that what worked locally may not translate as well nationally. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., added to the conversation on Sunday by suggesting that what worked in the Bronx for Ocasio-Cortez may not work nationwide. "I don't think you can go too far to the left and still win the Midwest," Duckworth said on CNN's "State of the Union." "Coming from a midwestern state, I think you need to be able to talk to the industrial Midwest. You need to be able to listen to the people there in order to win an election nationwide."

"If the Stamp Farm wind turbine is built, the health risk of flicker impact created by shadows of blades of turbines poses real and significant health risks, particularly seizures."	Because it is also a flood plain, the project’s 989,000 solar panels will be mounted on frames 12ft tall – the height of a double-decker bus. Unlike most solar farms, Cleve Hill Solar Park’s panels will not all face south, but east and west in a continuous zig-zag. The effect, say the scheme’s opponents, will be to turn green meadows into something resembling a colossal factory roof. Economically and environmentally the scheme makes no sense whatsoever. Apart from ruining a huge swathe of countryside and killing or displacing all the local wildlife, it will do little for Britain’s energy needs.

"In Iran in 1979, the extremists hijacked the broad-based popular revolution against the Shah and established a brutal theocracy."	Calls for an Iran without its current “dictatorial regime” were met with strengthened hope during the annual “free Iran” rally held in Paris this past weekend by the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), an exiled Paris-based Iranian opposition group allied with the Mujaheddin-e-Khalq (MEK). The rally, which event organizers said saw more than 100,000 attendees, took place at the Villepinte Congress Center, outside of Paris on Saturday. A series of panel discussions ranging in topic from women’s rights to denuclearization took place on Friday. The Guardian reported there was “a crowd of about 4,000, many of them refugees and young eastern Europeans who had been bussed in to attend the rally in return for a weekend trip to Paris.”
Distinguished speakers at Saturday’s event included former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal attorney; New Mexico’s former Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson; former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich; former Sen. Robert Torricelli (D-NJ); former FBI Director Louis Freeh; former Homeland Security Adviser Frances Townsend; and former U.S. Army chief of staff Gen. George Casey.
"On immigration reform, Marco Rubio all along has been saying, We have to have border security first and then he gets on Spanish TV, he ends up saying, No, no. That will never get in the way."	Just hours after his historic election victory sent thousands of supporters pouring on to the streets, the 64-year-old leftist tweeted that he had received a call from Donald Trump. “I proposed that we explore an integral agreement of development projects, which generate jobs in Mexico and with that reduce migration and improve security. There was respectful treatment and our representatives will speak more.”
In an interview with the Televisa news network, López Obrador emphasized the need for mutual respect and cooperation between the two neighbors. “We are conscious of the need to maintain good relations with the United States.

"Dem-controlled Ohio House voted to change the process, to create objective criteria, to modify the Constitution ... to take politics out of the efforts to draw legislative boundaries."	The Senate consists of 47 Democrats and two independents who represent more than half of the population, and 51 Republicans who represent less than half of the population. This obviously does not represent the will of the people. An institution created with the lofty responsibility of giving “advice and consent” has become an enabling tool to suppress democracy. Representatives of less than half of the population now have the power to impose their slanted view of the Constitution on the entire nation, for decades to come. This is who we are.
"Over the last few years, weve put more people back to work than all the other advanced economies combined."

"Obama ""voted against critical resources: no to individual body armor, no to helicopters, no to ammunition, no to aircraft."""	Even though he received what he called a “shellacking” in the 2010 midterms, and even though the GOP made unprecedented political gains during his tenure, President Obama was always convinced the country was behind him.

The next year – with CNN describing President Obama as an “unpopular president limping through his second term” – Republicans reclaimed control of the Senate. As a result of that achievement, President Obama’s chances of securing a liberal majority on the high court all but disappeared.As Mara Liasson wrote for NPR in 2016: “During Obama's eight years in office, the Democrats have lost more House, Senate, state legislative and governors seats than under any other president.” She noted that the Obama legacy includes “one huge failure: a diminished Democratic Party.”

"Under Tom Barretts leadership, violent crime in Milwaukee has decreased by over 20% -- to its lowest levels in more than 20 years."	On this much police and activist South Side priest Michael Pfleger can agree: Saturday morning’s anti-violence march on the Dan Ryan Expressway is all about danger. Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.
Barack Obama appeared in the video for 'Whoomp! (There it is!)'	Ethiopia's government has fired five prison officials as it confronts allegations of torture and other abuses of inmates as part of a wave of reforms. Among those fired is the federal prison chief who until recently defended the treatment of inmates as "fair." The firings came ahead of a new Human Rights Watch report released Thursday that documents widespread arbitrary detention, torture, rape and humiliation over several years in Ethiopia's eastern Somali region. It urges new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to investigate the "horrific" situation. Abiy has admitted that security forces have tortured people but has yet to "tackle Ethiopia's culture of impunity and ensure accountability," said Felix Horne, senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch.

Judge John Blawie told Sumpter that he believed his version of events, but had to follow the letter of the law. Under Connecticut law, assault victims cannot use deadly force if they are able to retreat from their attackers. By contrast, 27 states — most notably Florida — have passed so-called “stand-your-ground” laws, which entitle citizens to use force in self-defense if there is a reasonable belief of a threat. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

"Prior to Obamacare here in Wisconsin, 95 percent of Wisconsinites were covered by insurance. After Obamacare, 95 percent of Wisconsinites were covered by insurance. It hasnt had an impact."	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”

As a result of that achievement, President Obama’s chances of securing a liberal majority on the high court all but disappeared.
The rifle used by Omar Mateen shoots off 700 rounds in a minute.	His precise motive is unclear. This attack is "not a symbol or a representation of our community in Boise, but it's a single evil individual who attacked people with no provocation that we are aware of," Bones said. Kinner is being questioned by authorities. He has been booked into jail on nine counts of aggravated battery and six counts of injury to a child. The police found victims of the attack both within apartments and in the complex's parking lot.
"Building and running the Atlanta Streetcar is projected to create 1,399 jobs."	That came on the heels of 0.9 percent drop in March, the first monthly drop since July of 2017. Total private construction rose 0.3 percent, with residential projects up 0.8 percent in May. New single-family home construction rose 0.6 percent and the volatile apartment building sector jumped 1.6 percent. Private, non-residential building fell 0.3 percent. Economists are forecasting that construction spending will contribute to overall growth this year even though interest rates are rising.
"Wisconsin is one of the bluest states, but under Scott Walker its unemployment rate is around 3.5%."	EU cuts migration deal after marathon talks Migrant deal welcome, but implementation tricky, Bavarian conservative says Euro rallies on EU migration agreement; dollar slumps 5/ HOW LOW WILL IT GO? June’s U.S. unemployment data, due Friday, will be closely-watched for further signs of a tightening labour market. Unemployment data for May boosted markets, with the rate falling to an 18-year low, pointing to strength in the U.S. economy, and helping send stocks up around 1 percent that day. Nonfarm payrolls surged by 223,000 jobs during that month as warm weather bolstered hiring at construction sites. June’s data is expected to show a 200,000 increase, according to a Reuters poll.
Residential property taxes [in Providence] are up nearly 27 percent under Mayor Taveras.	Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.
"Assault weapons and handguns are allowed in the state Capitol while bullhorns, trumpets, helium balloons and flags on poles are banned."	Those lawyers have shown boundless creativity in reinterpreting the constitution. Getting past them is a daunting task. Still, Emanuel was worried enough to get his stooges on the City Council to try to block Quinn’s measure. Last week, they hustled through three advisory referenda — throwaway questions whose true purpose is to crowd anything meaningful off the ballot. State law says only three such measures can appear on the ballot.
Teachers are working their third consecutive year -- some longer than that -- without salary increases.	Hamilton, the Republican state lawmaker who beat the incumbent Karnes, won with a mix of support from teachers and other unions. While Karnes sparred with teachers during the strike, Hamilton took a moderate position. He aligned with teachers unions by opposing state right-to-work legislation and the proposed repeal of prevailing wage laws for public construction projects. The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.
The highest paid employee of the State of Rhode Island is a basketball coach.	The liberal high school teacher ousted a 24-year incumbent who served as House majority leader in 2016. Now, the state party has endorsed a professor at a Catholic University who signed a letter supporting Ireland's abortion ban, which was recently overturned. "Quite frankly, they are not used to women of color, black women, standing up," Ranglin-Vassell said. Democratic state Rep. Teresa Tanzi, standing, talks with Democratic Rep. Marcia Ranglin-Vassell during the legislative session In Providence, Rhode Island, on Jan. 9, 2018. Many female lawmakers wore black on Tuesday at the Rhode Island Statehouse in solidarity with the Time's Up movement and as a statement against sexual misconduct, including Democratic Rep. Mia Ackerman, foreground.
I don't have lobbyists running my campaign.	Corporate America couldn’t hire Republican lobbyists fast enough after President Donald Trump’s election gave the GOP unified control of Washington. Now there are signs that Democrats are back in demand. Companies and trade groups are trying to hire congressional staffers with ties to influential House Democrats four months ahead of the midterm elections, in which Democrats are expected to pick up seats and potentially retake control of the House. Lobbyists are helping their clients meet with the Democrats who would become committee chairs if the party does win back the chamber. And trade groups are talking to members about what to expect from a Democratic takeover.
"Expanding Medicaid would require borrowing more money, drastically expanding our deficit."	But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said. Tackett said he's concerned about children, especially in Eastern Kentucky, which has a higher rate of Medicaid patients and some of the state's worst oral health. "I have no problem with them regulating the adults that are on Medicaid," Tackett said. "If they are young and healthy, they should be out working or doing something.
"After (Jeb) Bushs two terms in office, Floridas graduation rate was dead last and remains near the bottom."	'We’re going to run different'
His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
Farming is one of the fastest growing areas of our economy.	U.S. Treasuries and German Bund both saw buying while E-Mini futures for Wall Street’s S&P 500 ESc1 followed Europe and Asia’s lead with a loss of 0.5 percent. Shanghai blue chips .CSI300 had resumed their slide with a fall of 2.9 percent that soured sentiment across the region. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS fell 0.6 percent, adding to a 2 percent drop last week. Japan's Nikkei .N225 shed 2.2 percent to an 11-week low, with a survey of manufacturers showing sentiment had darkened a shade in the face of trade war threats. The purchasing managers’ index (PMI) still edged higher for June, but exports orders softened.
Weve seen the increase of alcohol use for underage kids even though alcohol has been illegal ... for kids under 21.	It has also been shared by a Facebook user with the comment: "Did not know sniffing was a thing in schools now!" Claire Robinson, from Newcastle-based drugs charity Positive Response to Overcoming Problems of Substance misuse (Props), said: "Drug use is something we find in almost all of our secondary schools and colleges. It's a problem that's always there. "For a good few years we did see a decrease in the number of young people reportedly taking substances. "But over the last 12 to 18 months we have seen a slight increase."
"If we had been on Obamacare and a bureaucrat was trying to tell me when I could get that CAT scan, that would have delayed my treatment."	"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.
The proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline is a bipartisan proposal.	— MINING: The EPA said last year that it won't require mining companies to prove they have the financial resources to clean up pollution, an Obama-era rule stemming from a long history of pollution spilling from abandoned mines into streams. Pruitt said modern mining practices and existing regulations made the financial requirement unnecessary and a burden on mining. — AUTOS: Pruitt's EPA has proposed freezing vehicle fuel-efficiency standards at 2020 levels for the next five years, according to a draft of the proposal obtained by Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del. For new vehicles, that means an average of about 30 miles per gallon instead of rising to 36 mpg by 2025 as Obama's EPA proposed. — OIL AND GAS: More than a dozen states are suing the EPA for failing to take action against leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, from oil and natural gas wells.
On support for gay marriage.	Bishop John Bauerschmidt, who oversees the Middle Tennessee region of the church, stands firmly by his decision not to authorize their use, nor allow clergy within his diocese to officiate the religious ceremonies or permit the weddings on church property. In doing so, the bishop says he is being faithful to his job of guarding the discipline, faith and unity of the church. April 2017: Black female Episcopal bishop of Indy diocese breaks stained glass ceiling
January 2016: Anglicans suspend Episcopal Church over stance on same-sex marriage
July 2015: Episcopalians vote to allow gay marriage in churches
"The teaching that Christian marriage is between a man and a woman is reasonable, traditional, and scriptural," Bauerschmidt said in an email. "There really is nothing remarkable about a Christian bishop who holds to this teaching." While Bishops can place limitations on the use of the marriage liturgies, they must refer couples to a willing diocese if they do not authorize them.
Says Mitt Romney just gave a speech a few weeks ago and said we should still have troops in Iraq.	The problem is so pervasive that a lawmaker recently asked El Salvador's Legislative Assembly for national identity cards to be issued without addresses "to save lives." Fifteen years ago, the Salvadoran government began a crackdown on gangs, resulting in thousands of members being imprisoned. Yet they continued to proliferate, even running operations with cell phones from behind bars. El Salvador's defense minister said in 2015 there were 60,000 gang members in the country, compared to a combined police and army strength of 50,000. Members of those security forces contribute to the violence that is causing the northward migration.
Says David Dewhurst explicitly advocated a guest worker program for all illegal immigrants.	In one case, Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion that illegal immigrants do not have the same bargaining rights as American citizens and legal workers. “… an illegal immigrant worker is not an ’employee’ under the NLRA for the simple reason that, ever since 1986, an illegal immigrant worker is not a lawful ’employee’ in the United States,” Kavanaugh wrote. In another case, Kavanaugh noted that American multi-national corporations do not have the right to import foreign workers. The Circuit judge explained, “Under the provision of the immigration laws at issue here, mere economic expediency does not authorize an employer to displace American workers for foreign workers.”
Prominent conservative Ann Coulter has also called for Trump to nominate Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, arguing that other judges such as Thomas Hardiman and Raymond Kethledge “are open borders zealots.”

A Republican proposal changes Medicare for those under age 55 so that they will participate in the same kind of health plan that members of Congress do.

Barack Obama had 150 days in the U.S. Senate where he was able to vote quite often 'present.' 	You've had Senators Joe Donnelly, Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp, who are the three red state Democrats who voted in favor of Neil Gorsuch, get their only personal meeting with President Trump and who say they are very open to confirming President Trump nominee who -- if the nominee is the right person. So those are the five senators who our attention is going to be really on for the next two months. BRENNAN: And what about immigration, Jan? Do you think this could actually come before the Supreme Court (INAUDIBLE)?
Much more than 50 percentof parents out there are spankers.	Kinner was being held without bail at the Ada County jail on 15 charges, including six of injury to a child and nine of aggravated battery, jail records showed. There was no lawyer listed for Kinner in the records. Kinner may have wanted to “extract vengeance” for being kicked out by a tenant who took him in, Police Chief Bill Bones said at a press conference on Sunday. The woman who took Kinner in was not harmed and was not at the residence at the time of the attack. Kinner assaulted the children at the party after he was unable to find the woman, police said, adding his motive was still under investigation.

Says Michelle Obama has 43 people on her staff; Nancy Reagan had just 3.	Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.
Says Rick Perry doubled spending in a decade.	And certainly Trump would deserve great credit for seeing the possibility of a peaceful solution where many of his advisers saw military action as the only option. In the meantime, we have much hard work ahead. It won’t be easy, and it won’t be quick. William J. Perry is a former secretary of defense.

It’s not strictly true to say everyone is against the three huge plant-forested glass spheres at what Amazon calls its “campus” in the heart of the city. The Bezos balls, as the conservatories are popularly known, are modelled on the greenhouses at London’s Kew Gardens, feature walkways above fig trees, ferns and rhododendrons, and provide hot-desking for Amazon workers looking for a break from the neighbouring office tower. There was nothing in that area 10 years ago,” said Jen Reed, selling jerky from another market stall. “I don’t hate Amazon the way that a lot of people hate them.

BRENNAN: We already had the travel ban.

"Says Tammy Baldwin supports a law in which government will take over your decisions on medicine, on doctors and on hospitals."	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”

"Says if we do nothing and continue to let Obamacare siphon off that $700 billion dollars off the top of it, Medicare goes away in less than 10 years -- certain accounts of it -- and it just falls apart at the seams."

"Says Sen. John McCain spent the July 4 weekend in Islamabad, Pakistan, selling F-16s and advanced weapons to the folks who harbored Osama bin Laden."	He was, in other words, beginning to sound more like his tweets, and perhaps just a bit like Donald Trump. Brennan’s father, Owen, was a blacksmith who immigrated to New Jersey from Ireland in 1948. Owen’s own father, Brennan told me, was “a supporter, an affiliate, say,” of the Irish Republican Army. Brennan moved twice while growing up, from one apartment to another before settling in a three-family house in North Bergen. His grandmother lived on the top floor.

Why is President Obama unnecessarily delaying your flight? FAA could cut other spending.	Dec. 7, 2016: Trump announces that Pruitt will be his nominee for EPA administrator
The then-Attorney General of Oklahoma was touted by Trump as having "great qualifications and a good record." Part of that record was Pruitt touting himself as a "leading advocate against the EPA's activist agenda," and his history of challenging the EPA was well known. Feb. 17, 2017: Confirmed by the Senate
Pruitt's confirmation, which was approved with a vote of 52-46, came in the midst of a court order that required him to turn over thousands of communications with major coal, oil and gas companies from his time in office. Democratic senators expressed outrage that Republicans were going ahead as scheduled with the vote on Pruitt, despite the judge’s ruling in the order. March 23, 2017: Defends budget cuts to his agency
The budget plan put forward by the Trump administration proposed cuts 31 percent of the EPA’s funding, including significant reductions to research programs and enforcement of clean air and clean water programs, but that didn’t bother Pruitt.

Washington politicians run Social Security like a Ponzi scheme.	Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
"Says Republican presidential candidate and Gov. John Kasich has spent 177 days out of state and used $350,000 in taxpayer money on his costly campaign."	Pruitt resigned less than a week after The New York Times reported that the EPA's chief ethics official, Kevin Minoli, had been pushing for a series of independent investigation into several aspects of Pruitt's tenure. Those include Pruitt's rental of a Washington D.C. condominium for $50 per day from the spouse of a prominent fossil fuel lobbyist and his alleged use of staff to handle personal matters. In all, the Times reported, Pruitt is facing 13 federal inquiries into his spending and management practices. Earlier this month House Democrats asked the Justice Department to investigate Pruitt for potential criminal conduct, alleging that he repeatedly violated federal anti-corruption laws by seeking to leverage his government position for personal gain. They cited the condo arrangement as well as Pruitt directing an EPA aide to contact a senior Chick-fil-A executive as part of an effort to land his family a franchise, and a $2,000 payment to his wife from organizers of a conference Pruitt then attended at taxpayer expense.
"Ever wonder why no one ever came forward from Obamas past, saying they knew him, attended school with him, was his friend, etc.? Not one person has ever come forward from his past."	The list of Democrats expressing frustration with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has been growing longer in recent weeks, but don’t expect to see former President Barack Obama’s name on it. At a party fundraising event Friday afternoon in Northern California, Obama spoke highly of Pelosi – and even predicted that she will return to the job of House speaker after November’s midterm elections. “I think everybody knows how much I love Nancy Pelosi,” Obama told the gathering at a home in affluent Atherton, Politico reported. "Nancy, I believe, is one of the greatest speakers we ever had, and will once again be one of the greatest speakers we ever have after we get through this cycle," he continued. “And there's not much I could have gotten done without having Nancy there alongside of me every step of the way.”

California has the sixth largest economy on planet Earth.	A Connecticut man who was assaulted by three juveniles while at work has been sentenced to prison for stabbing one of the attackers. The Connecticut Post reports 21-year-old Jeffrey Sumpter of Bridgeport received 18 months in jail Monday at a Stamford courthouse. The paper reported that Sumpter — who was convicted of felony first-degree assault — also will have to spend three years following his release on probation. If he breaks the law during that time, Sumpter could be made to serve all or part of a 42-month prison sentence. Sumpter was working at a Dunkin’ Donuts in Norwalk last October when he was jumped by three males.

Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.
Says area near proposed northern Wisconsin iron ore mine is 15 hours away from where public hearing on mining was held.	“Opening up the Galilee would generate 16,000 direct mining jobs and tens of billions in taxes.”
The report says the combined value of metallurgical and thermal coal exports will be $60.2bn in 2017-18, behind iron ore at $61.8bn. It says coal exports will be slightly lower at $58.1bn in 2018-19, and that iron ore earnings will be even lower at $57.7bn, as falling iron ore prices drive export earnings lower. The Australian characterised that event as coal reclaiming its mantle as the nation’s “top export earner”. But the report says coal export earnings will soon drop below those for iron ore again, as global coal prices fall. India's huge solar ambitions could push coal further into shade Read more
In 2019-20 coal export earnings will be just $51.1bn, while iron ore earnings will be $55.4bn.
Our credit rating went up since Ive been in office.	Tesla could use a lighter moment. It has had a 2018 filled with ups and downs. In May, Consumer Reports initially did not recommend the electric vehicle giant’s Model 3, its first car priced for mainstream buyers, in part because of long stopping distances, only to see the magazine relent after it flashed software to cars that improved them. Last month, Tesla topped a list of best-selling electric vehicles in the United States, selling three of the five most popular cars. And this week, Tesla announced that it had reached Musk's goal of manufacturing 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week.
African-American children are 500 percent more likely to die from asthma than white kids.	The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) spent a total of $4 billion on improper food stamp payments to those receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the USDA confirmed with Breitbart News on Friday. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service announced this week that improper payments made up 6.3 percent of SNAP money in the fiscal year (FY) 2017—the latest data available from the agency. Breitbart News analyzed the USDA’s data on food stamp spending and found that $4,007,026,532 of the $63,603,595,754 the agency spent on SNAP in FY 2017 went to improper payments. The USDA told Breitbart News that “it is important to note that improper payments include both overpayments and underpayments,” meaning that households on SNAP that received less than what they were supposed to receive for the month are also included in the percentage rate. Brandon Lipps, the Acting Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services at the agency, said that most improper payments are due to “human errors”—either because of state agencies miscalculating benefits or benefit recipients giving state agencies the wrong information.
U.S. police killed more people in just one month than the U.K.s did in over a century.	Five children 15 and younger were among 23 people shot during a scorching weekend in Chicago. From Friday afternoon to early Monday, 21 people were wounded and two people were killed, including a 14-year-old boy who was shot early Saturday while walking in the Washington Park neighborhood, according to police. About nine hours earlier, another 14-year-old boy was shot in the Loop. He was coming up stairs at the corner of Wabash Avenue and Wacker Drive when he was shot in the leg Friday evening, police said.

The legislature was never given the opportunity to debate or vote on loaning $75 million to 38 Studios.	Trump has since ordered the separations be stopped, but it hasn't curbed calls on the left to "abolish ICE." Hundreds of thousands of marchers participated in more than 700 marches across the country over the weekend to protest the family separations. They gathered on the front lawn of a Border Patrol station in McAllen, Texas, near a detention center where migrant children were being held in cages, and on a street corner near Trump's golf resort at Bedminster, New Jersey, where the president was spending the weekend. Tweeting Saturday from New Jersey, Trump urged ICE agents to "not worry or lose your spirit" and wrote that "the radical left Dems want you out. Next it will be all police."

The president by executive order could grant voting rights to illegal immigrants who are newly legalized under pending legislation.	Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.

In some offices, dictation is automated into reports through voice recognition software, but this is an imperfect practice and often requires additional double-checking by a real human.

It can also mislead a future provider, influence how the office’s service is coded and therefore billed, or even confuse or mislead the patient when he or she is reviewing records. Doctors are human too, and they often dictate late at night after long shifts. Mistakes they didn’t make during a surgery can occur in the retelling of it.

Democratic activists say the “Abolish ICE” campaign is not intended to open the borders which are guarded by the Customs and Border Protection agency. Instead, the activists say they hope to block ICE from deporting the economic migrants or refugees who get across the border, and who are seeking jobs and apartments as well as schools for their children. But that no-deportations policy would allow many companies to hire illegals instead of Americans. That subsequent rush of migrants would force down wages for Americans and for legal immigrants, force up rents and housing prices, and also overcrowd public K-12 schools.

Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, one of the most powerful conservatives in Congress, has denied reports that he ignored the alleged sexual abuse of athletes while he worked as an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University more than 20 years ago. Allegations that Jordan was aware of sexual misconduct and explicitly was informed of specific incidents of alleged assault by the wrestling team's doctor, first surfaced in an NBC news story on Tuesday. But Jordan — who was an assistant coach from 1987 until 1995, when he was elected to the state legislature — has refuted the claims. "Congressman Jordan never saw any abuse, never heard about any abuse, and never had any abuse reported to him during his time as a coach at Ohio State," Ian Fury, Jordan's spokesman, said in a statement. "He has not been contacted by investigators about the matter but will assist them in any way they ask, because if what is alleged is true, the victims deserve a full investigation and justice."

Says taking millionaires off food stamps and unemployment would save $20 million.	The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) spent a total of $4 billion on improper food stamp payments to those receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the USDA confirmed with Breitbart News on Friday. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service announced this week that improper payments made up 6.3 percent of SNAP money in the fiscal year (FY) 2017—the latest data available from the agency. Breitbart News analyzed the USDA’s data on food stamp spending and found that $4,007,026,532 of the $63,603,595,754 the agency spent on SNAP in FY 2017 went to improper payments. The USDA told Breitbart News that “it is important to note that improper payments include both overpayments and underpayments,” meaning that households on SNAP that received less than what they were supposed to receive for the month are also included in the percentage rate. Brandon Lipps, the Acting Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services at the agency, said that most improper payments are due to “human errors”—either because of state agencies miscalculating benefits or benefit recipients giving state agencies the wrong information.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
"If we pass immigration reform, it will make wages go up on average $250 for the average household."	But that no-deportations policy would allow many companies to hire illegals instead of Americans.

Trump’s campaign to limit legal and illegal immigration is driving up wages and salaries for Americans in various locations and careers around the country. The beneficiaries include new employees, African-American bakers in Chicago, Latino restaurant workers in Monterey, Calif., disabled people nationwide, high schoolers, resort workers in Hilton Head, construction workers, Superbowl workers, the garment industry, and workers at small businesses, and even Warren Buffett’s railroad workers. Amnesty advocates rely on business-funded “Nation of Immigrants” push-polls to show apparent voter support for immigration and immigrants. But “choice” polls reveal most voters’ often-ignored preference that CEOs should hire Americans at decent wages before hiring migrants.
"Due to actions by President Barack Obama, the Burger King national headquarters announced this month that they will be pulling their franchises from our military bases."	Full-service restaurants with more elaborate menus and more complex processes, like the Red Hen and those in The Trump Organization properties, are more vulnerable to violations than fast-food eateries with limited food offerings and a streamlined kitchen production line, said Craig Hedberg, a professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Minnesota. And those with repeated violations can get into even more trouble with their local health departments, said Hedberg. Those eateries will be flagged by inspectors, who bring copies of previous reports on their visits and can spot patterns of regulation flouting. How repeat offenses are handled differs by jurisdiction. “It’s very rare to see a perfect score,” he said.

"East Coast developer Matt Rosendale is only looking out for himself and whatever out-of-state special interest group that is propping up his campaign with cash. We can't trust him to defend Montana." But before Trump arrived in Montana, Tester's campaign took out full-page ads in newspapers across the state, highlighting bills the senator sponsored that Trump has signed into law.
The United States had allies lined up for air strikes in Syria and then Obama pulled the rug out.	In their statement, Mr Netanyahu and Mr Morawiecki praised the Polish wartime government-in-exile, saying it tried to "raise awareness among Western allies of the systematic murder" of Polish Jews. They also said structures of the Polish underground state supervised by the Polish government-in-exile "created a mechanism of systematic help and support to Jewish people". However Yad Vashem said this contradicted decades of historical research and contained "grave errors and deceptions". It said much of the Polish resistance in its various movements "not only failed to help Jews, but was also not infrequently actively involved in persecuting them". Polish assistance to Jews during the Holocaust was "relatively rare", Yad Vashem said, and "attacks against and even the murder of Jews were widespread".

Companies and trade groups are trying to hire congressional staffers with ties to influential House Democrats four months ahead of the midterm elections, in which Democrats are expected to pick up seats and potentially retake control of the House. Lobbyists are helping their clients meet with the Democrats who would become committee chairs if the party does win back the chamber.

"Rick Perry thinks injecting 11- and 12-year-old girls with a controversial drug (the HPV vaccine), without a parents consent, is a good idea."

The June 29 installment of Dixon Vice Mayor Ted Hickman’s column, “That’s Life,” contained a number of slurs against LGBTQ people and other eyebrow-raising language. Blasting June as “LGBTQF-WTF month,” Hickman suggested “Straight Pride American Month,” or “SPAM,” as a time for “healthy, heterosexual, fairly monogamous, keep our kinky stuff to ourselves Americans” to be celebrated nationwide. “Don’t get me wrong I support the First Amendment, as much as the next person, and support the rights of grown men to wear skin tight short-shorts and go-go boots and don tinker bell wings with wand and prance down the streets of San Francisco,” Hickman wrote. Ted Hickman should be ashamed for sharing such an awful message... Dixon, CA needs to do better.

Police told the crowd to disperse after the statement, warning “otherwise, we will intervene.” Officers patrolled with dogs and had water cannons stationed nearby. They fired tear gas on groups in some areas and were seen elsewhere pushing and shouting at participants who were too slow to scatter. March organizers said Friday that the governor had prohibited the march in violation of the right to freedom of assembly. The governor has cited security reasons and public “sensitivities” as grounds for barring LGBTI marches since 2015.

Says Florida rubber-stamped phony horse racing.	According to a Russian state media report related by Turkey’s Hurriyet Daily News , the United States is planning to send next-generation B61 nuclear gravity bombs to NATO bases in several European countries, including Turkey. The bomb is said to be compatible with F-35 joint strike fighters, which Turkey is also due to receive amid some controversy. Hurriyet describes the B61 nuclear bomb and Russia’s sour reaction to the prospect of NATO bases receiving them:
The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) and the U.S. Air Force completed two non-nuclear system qualification flight tests of the B61-12 gravity bomb on June 9 at Tonopah Test Range in Nevada, according to a June 29 statement by DOE/NNSA. The test, which was reportedly the first of its kind, was aimed at extending the B61 bomb’s service life by adapting it to next generation aircraft, including B-2A Spirit Bomber. “The B61-12 LEP will consolidate and replace the existing B61 bomb variants in the [U.S.] nuclear stockpile.

Progressives who are surprised by Kennedy’s retirement bought into the myth that the justice, who occasionally swung left on key controversies like abortion and gay rights, was a moderate who dabbled in liberalism. In reality, he never really was a centrist. He voted with the right flank on most issues; his big defections were deviations from the norm. On marriage equality, he was personally sympathetic; on abortion, he genuinely thought he could unite the warring factions.

Their kids have just been kidnapped. How do you prepare for your [asylum case?] Carlos García, immigration lawyer,
On top of his private practice, García plans to visit Port Isabel a few times a week, which is an hour and a half drive from his office, to give migrants legal advice. He recently committed to fully representing a mother who has not spoken to her six-year-old child in three weeks. García says he’s tempted to take on more cases every time he visits the detention center, and he receives a few emails every day from other lawyers about someone else in need of an attorney.

Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 startedthe birther controversy.	Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups. According to the New York Times, the Supreme court’s decision will affect these left-wing groups and causes. “If the progressive movement is a navy, they’re trying to take out our aircraft carriers,” said Ben Wikler, of MoveOn.org, the Times reported. However, progressive groups are optimistic that the loss of union funds will be compensated for with grass-roots activism.

"Says U.S. Rep. John Barrow, D-Ga., celebrates gun ownership even in the face of school shootings."	On this much police and activist South Side priest Michael Pfleger can agree: Saturday morning’s anti-violence march on the Dan Ryan Expressway is all about danger. Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.

Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.

'THIS IS YOUR RECEIPT': Jarrod W. Ramos, the man suspected of killing five people during an attack on the Capital Gazette newspaper last week in Annapolis, Maryland, sent multiple threatening letters prior to the shooting, police revealed on Monday ... The paper’s former attorney gave police mail he received at his law office on Monday, the newspaper's former publisher Thomas Marquardt told The Baltimore Sun. One of those documents, dated June 28 – the same day as the shooting – allegedly included a letter from Ramos in which he said he was en route to the paper “with the objective of killing every person present.”
The letter was written in the form of a “Motion for Reconsideration” by a Maryland court following a 2016 refusal to hear Ramos’ defamation case that he had filed against the outlet. That stemmed from a 2011 column published in the paper about a criminal harassment charge against Ramos that was filed by a former high school classmate. “You were too cowardly to confront those lies, and this is your receipt,” he allegedly wrote.

"Says a new state report confirms that red-light cameras lead to more accidents, more injuries and greater cost."	Practice is only one of Deborah Glass’s 125 recommendations not accepted by Victorian government
Female prisoners in Victoria are still subject to “abusive” routine strip searches, a state government watchdog says. The Victorian ombudsman, Deborah Glass, said the government has failed to adopt a recommendation from her 2015 report into the prison system that called for an end to the searches. “Why has the government not accepted my recommendation to stop the abusive practice of routinely strip-searching women prisoners – in fact, the only recommendation out of 125 not accepted?” she asked on Wednesday. The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year.
"Only seven of 18 federal food assistance programs have been associated with positive health and nutrition outcomes, while the remaining 11 have not been effective."	The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) spent a total of $4 billion on improper food stamp payments to those receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the USDA confirmed with Breitbart News on Friday. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service announced this week that improper payments made up 6.3 percent of SNAP money in the fiscal year (FY) 2017—the latest data available from the agency. Breitbart News analyzed the USDA’s data on food stamp spending and found that $4,007,026,532 of the $63,603,595,754 the agency spent on SNAP in FY 2017 went to improper payments. The USDA told Breitbart News that “it is important to note that improper payments include both overpayments and underpayments,” meaning that households on SNAP that received less than what they were supposed to receive for the month are also included in the percentage rate. Brandon Lipps, the Acting Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services at the agency, said that most improper payments are due to “human errors”—either because of state agencies miscalculating benefits or benefit recipients giving state agencies the wrong information.The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) spent a total of $4 billion on improper food stamp payments to those receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the USDA confirmed with Breitbart News on Friday.
Republicans enacted the most drastic cuts to K-12 public schools of any state in the nation.	He should exercise that power, listen to all those marching today & clean up the mess he made w/ his slapdash family separation policy. #FamiliesBelongTogetherMarch — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) June 30, 2018
Democratic activists say the “Abolish ICE” campaign is not intended to open the borders which are guarded by the Customs and Border Protection agency. Instead, the activists say they hope to block ICE from deporting the economic migrants or refugees who get across the border, and who are seeking jobs and apartments as well as schools for their children. But that no-deportations policy would allow many companies to hire illegals instead of Americans. That subsequent rush of migrants would force down wages for Americans and for legal immigrants, force up rents and housing prices, and also overcrowd public K-12 schools.
Just look at what the FBI director said about her (Hillary Clinton) her misconduct is a disgrace and embarrassment to our country.	The report also said that Strzok repeatedly pushed for more aggressive action in the Clinton probe. "The conduct by these employees cast a cloud over the entire FBI investigation and sowed doubt about the FBI’s work," the report concluded. "The damage caused by these employees’ actions extends far beyond the scope of the (Clinton) investigation and goes to the heart of the FBI’s reputation for neutral fact finding and political independence." Goelman, in an op-ed in USA TODAY last month, said Strzok has become the victim of "political gamesmanship" by Congress and President Trump, who has repeatedly tweeted about Strzok as evidence of bias by the FBI and Justice Department. "They have spent months cynically taking these texts out of context and saying that one- or two-word snippets somehow prove that the FBI investigations of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the Russia probe itself, were biased," Goelman wrote.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Fred Knapp/NET News Fred Knapp/NET News
Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.
Big oil's filling John McCain's campaign with $2-million in contributions.	Research has consistently shown that Trump won because of racial resentment among white voters. Chris Hayes (@chrislhayes) The modern GOP is basically Steve Bannon, Steve King and Stephen Miller on one side engaged in a project to preserve and enshrine dominance for its ethnic/racial base, and Paul Ryan and John Roberts on the other who pretend they have no idea what they’re up to. While that strategy has worked in the short-term, some Republicans recognize that it can’t work in the long-term, and they’re fighting to save their party from extinction. Can a carbon tax save the GOP? Climate change is one of many issues that divides the Republican Party.
"We have over 700,000 illegal immigrants in the state. Theyre costing us billions of dollars and theyre taking legal residents jobs."	“Going to the White House was at some personal and reputational cost for both of them. But they care more about trying to be in the ring to fix things than they care about what’s said about them personally.”
That kind of thinking, those associates believe, likely led Nielsen to decide to become the public face of the Trump administration’s decidedly unpopular policy of separating the families of immigrants who cross the border illegally. To say it was a rocky transition is an understatement. During a Cabinet meeting in early May, Trump reportedly berated Nielsen and other officials for 30 minutes, incensed after learning that more than 50,000 people had been arrested for illegally crossing the southern border for two consecutive months—a massive jump in arrests, suggesting a fresh influx of the immigrants the president had promised to stop. A source told POLITICO at the time that Trump believed Nielsen was not focused enough on his immigration agenda.
"A third of all the young people in America are not in America today because of abortion, because one in three pregnancies end in abortion."	Hope Life Center in western Illinois provides unplanned pregnancy counseling and ultrasounds for about five to 10 women a week, with a mission to “erase abortion from Illinois one woman and one child at time,” according to its website. So Executive Director Debbie Case was alarmed by a change last year in the state's so-called right-of-conscience law, requiring health care providers to inform pregnant patients of all available medical options, including abortion. She said the pregnancy center even shut down for part of 2017 because its physician feared potential repercussions of violating the law, which is now temporarily blocked by the courts. Case and other anti-abortion advocates across the state hailed Tuesday’s ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court against a similar law in California on First Amendment grounds, hoping the decision will strengthen their legal battle in Illinois. “We’re definitely encouraged,” said Case, whose center is in Sterling, about two hours west of Chicago.
Says Mitt Romneys plan makes catastrophic cuts to education.	The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. Teachers are also running a ballot measure campaign that would tax the highest income earners for an additional $690 million to spend on schools. “Regardless of political parties, we need people to make a decision about what’s happening in the classroom,” said Marisol Garcia, vice president of the Arizona Education Association. “To limit ourselves and to say ‘only these people are going to support us’ is just not true.”
Teachers can be at a disadvantage compared to wealthier candidates, who tend to have built-in networks of potential donors.
On same-sex marriage.	Bishop John Bauerschmidt, who oversees the Middle Tennessee region of the church, stands firmly by his decision not to authorize their use, nor allow clergy within his diocese to officiate the religious ceremonies or permit the weddings on church property. In doing so, the bishop says he is being faithful to his job of guarding the discipline, faith and unity of the church.

"The teaching that Christian marriage is between a man and a woman is reasonable, traditional, and scriptural," Bauerschmidt said in an email. "There really is nothing remarkable about a Christian bishop who holds to this teaching." While Bishops can place limitations on the use of the marriage liturgies, they must refer couples to a willing diocese if they do not authorize them.
"According to the most recent jobs report, weve got more Americans leaving the workforce than we have finding jobs."	Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) trashed the June jobs report — even though it showed rapid job growth, rising wages, and low unemployment. The report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that employers created 213,000 new jobs in June — 22,000 more than economists had expected. Manufacturing jobs in particular rose by 36,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.
Fidel (Castro) has made his preferences known in the campaign and had some very unkind things to say about me.	He had a small team of allies and has built his political life with them. The big exception was during this election he realized astutely that no one can win by himself. He has built a large coalition that includes a far-right party completely opposed to progressive politics. He has done so because he needed them to win. How will he behave toward those members of his very odd coalition is anyone’s guess.

Nearly 600 more retail jobs are to go in the UK as the Jacques Vert, Windsmoor and Precis department store brands are wound down by administrators.

The latest retail job losses come as more than 30,000 jobs are at risk in the UK following mass closure announcements by major chains including House of Fraser, New Look and Marks & Spencer. Retailers are suffering from rising costs and the switch to online shopping just as hard-pressed consumers rein in spending.

It was no surprise to read that the very first lesson you suggest could be learned from overseas (Five things the NHS could do to improve service, 3 July) is the establishment of integrated health and social care, as has happened in New Zealand. The achievements of the Attlee government are at the heart of my socialist beliefs but the compromises which led then to the split between free NHS care and means-tested social care remain the achilles heel as the NHS celebrates 70 years. It is utterly ludicrous to have separate systems which imply distinct and neat boundaries between health and care, with rather a lot of people making a good living arguing on which side of the fence some poor demented soul belongs. Disputes around the funding of continuing care have become a major industry. The recent NHS funding announcement, making no reference whatsoever to social care, evidenced the fact that the government still hasn’t the least idea of how the two are umbilically linked.

In a plea deal with Imran Awan, who worked as an information technology aide for Rep.

"Says Bill Clinton signed a law very similar to, and Barack Obama voted for a law something like, Indianas Religious Freedom Restoration Act."	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”

"Says the United States is the only nation that affords citizenship to anyone born here, whether you are here legally or illegally."	The government agency that oversees immigration applications is hiring lawyers and immigration officers to review cases of immigrants suspected of obtaining citizenship through fake identities or other false information on their applications. Cases would be referred to the Department of Justice, where offenders could lose their citizenship or legal status. The small scale of this effort belies its significance. As a country, the United States makes few distinctions between naturalized citizens and their native-born counterparts. The naturalization process, which includes long-term residents with deep ties to the U.S., is assumed to be permanent.
"Mary Burkes record: 130,000 fewer jobs."	Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) trashed the June jobs report — even though it showed rapid job growth, rising wages, and low unemployment. The report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that employers created 213,000 new jobs in June — 22,000 more than economists had expected. Manufacturing jobs in particular rose by 36,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.
"Says she would bring 186,740 new jobs to Wisconsin and Donald Trump would cost Wisconsin 61,050 jobs."	Radisson Hospitality CEO John Kidd said the tariff dispute could depress business travel to China. Trump has made wooing foreign companies to expand U.S. manufacturing a priority, deeming it evidence that he's making good on promises to restore economic vitality to struggling regions. On Thursday he traveled to Wisconsin to celebrate the groundbreaking of a $10 billion assembly plant for Foxconn Technology Group, the Taiwanese iPhone contractor's first major U.S. facility. Trump hailed the construction of a plant he said would be "the 8th wonder of the world" as an endorsement of his policies. "We have a lot of things going in the United States," he said.
Says Planned Parenthood provides about 140 visits for prenatal care in each state.	BREAKING: @NEAToday President @Lily_NEA reacts to radical ruling by #SCOTUS: "We are living in a system that is rigged to benefit special interests & billionaires, all at the expense of working people." FULL STATEMENT: https://t.co/uE4j5lQPGh #Janus #JanusvAFSCME #Union — NEA Public Relations (@NEAMedia) June 27, 2018
A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.
"Says that in 41 states, government workers are better paid than the taxpayers who support them."	State and local government construction spending was $282.1 billion, the most since September of 2009. Spending on the power grid increased nearly 11 percent on a monthly basis, and is up more than 25 percent over a year ago.
We are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana.	The prospect of a major shooting war cannot be dismissed. To this anxious litany Trump brings a reassuring antidote: more nationalism. Some of Trump’s efforts to control globalization have already backfired. To wit: Harley-Davidson’s decision to move some production to Europe — in response to Europe’s higher tariffs on Harley-Davidson bikes, which in turn were a reaction to Trump’s higher tariffs on European steel and aluminum exports.
"500,000 people have signed up for #Obamacare."	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”

The economy began its nose dive when Democrats took control of Congress in January 2007.	Many Americans gaze at the sky and see only a vast uncharted frontier for exploration. But President Donald Trump reminds Americans that there’s another potential reality in space: It could become a military battlefield, a place where this nation’s independence is protected or lost. The point isn’t to repel an alien invasion from deep space. We’re not worried about Klingons. But Americans do have reason to be concerned about technologically advancing adversaries here on Earth.

In its statement, Delancey said it remained committed to ensuring the continued maintenance of the centre but added that it was over 50 years old, “and as is often the way with older buildings, some elements do unfortunately fail”. The delay in repairing the escalator was because it was so old, spare parts were no longer made and had to be specially manufactured, the spokeswoman said. The shopping centre has long attracted scorn and been dismissed as an eyesore – not least because of its “manky, hot-pink” exterior, as Time Out once put it – but some see that as part of its charm, with the Guardian’s property section once describing it approvingly as the “anti-Westfield”.

"Says when he was governor, most of the Democrats voted for his billion-dollar property-tax cuts, but U.S. Senate rival Tammy Baldwin voted against it."	He aligned himself with most of his Democratic colleagues against Gina Haspel, Trump's pick for CIA director, arguing that her record on enhanced interrogation techniques was unacceptable. And instead of focusing on a politically safe issue in his maiden Senate floor speech, Jones struck a nerve by calling for a dialogue on gun violence after the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida. In addition, during the campaign, Jones made no secret of his desire to protect LGBTQ rights and to support a woman's right to abortion. It's those kinds of positions that have made him a darling of Alabama's progressive minority — and somewhat of a public enemy among the state's conservative majority. Jones has introduced four pieces of legislation — none of any huge significance — since he arrived on Capitol Hill, including two agriculture bills, one that would expand access to capital for rural job creators and the last seeking to mandate an annual Medicaid expansion review.
"When Tallahassee politicians and bureaucrats tried to run our schools, Ive stood up to them to protect local control."	The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. Teachers are also running a ballot measure campaign that would tax the highest income earners for an additional $690 million to spend on schools. “Regardless of political parties, we need people to make a decision about what’s happening in the classroom,” said Marisol Garcia, vice president of the Arizona Education Association. “To limit ourselves and to say ‘only these people are going to support us’ is just not true.”
Teachers can be at a disadvantage compared to wealthier candidates, who tend to have built-in networks of potential donors.
John McCain said last year he didn't know of a solution to the mortgage crisis.	Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau responded on Sunday to allegations that he groped a woman at a music festival in Creston, British Columbia, nearly two decades ago. “I remember that day in Creston well,” he told reporters during a three-day tour in Regina, Canada. “I had a good day that day. I don’t remember any negative interactions that day at all.”
The allegations against Trudeau resurfaced in June when a Twitter user shared a photo of an editorial article written by an anonymous reporter in 2000 in Creston Valley Advance, a local newspaper. The article alleges that Trudeau, then a 28-year-old teacher, groped a female reporter at the Kokanee Summit music festival in 2000.
One Wisconsin school district is so worried about losing state funding that it has stopped giving milk to elementary school kids during snack time.	The new law - approved by 87 votes to 15 in the 120-seat Knesset late on Monday - requires the Israeli government to withhold an amount of tax revenue equal to what is paid by the PA to "individuals who were involved in terror activity against Israelis and their families". If the defence ministry determines that such payments are no longer being made, the frozen funds will be returned to the PA.
Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman hailed the legislation, saying: "An effective war on terrorism also passes through the pocket - of the terrorists, of their families and of [Palestinian Authority President] Mahmoud Abbas." Image copyright AFP Image caption The law's sponsors said the PA's payments were "an expression of support for acts of terror"
But chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat condemned what he called a "very dangerous decision that amounts to the cancellation of the Palestinian Authority and is piracy and theft". The PA's Minister of Prisoner Affairs, Issa Qaraqeh, meanwhile insisted the payments would continue. "When we signed Oslo Agreement, it was clear to Israel that the Palestinian Authority pays these families, and they never objected," he was quoted as saying by the Associated Press.
"Mitt Romney is tearing down his 3,000-square-foot house to build an 11,000-square-foot house."	Even Pruitt’s own staff had begun to sour on him, with many worrying that their future career prospects would be damaged by their association with Pruitt’s tenure. Each scandal seemed more damning than the last. Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.
"Jeff Weems legal record is one of defending BP, Enron and just about every big oil company against the working man."	He replaced the head of his security detail who wouldn’t let him use lights and sirens to zip around the city like the president. And a top career official was dismissed after he questioned the security justifications for Pruitt’s beefed up, multimillion-dollar protective detail. Questions were raised about why Pruitt hired a longtime friend, whose bank over the years issued Pruitt multiple mortgages and helped him buy part ownership of a baseball team, and who was recently banned from the banking industry, to run EPA’s Superfund program. In recent weeks, former Pruitt aides told staffers on the House Oversight Committee about the administrator's search for a high-paying job for his wife and his use of EPA time and staff for personal matters. Although nascent, the new allegations raised questions of whether Pruitt had used his position to benefit his family or himself.

Local reports cited depositions that Large took before his death wherein he reportedly admitted to suggesting some of the women participate in "catfight videos" for money, but he denied the claims of sexual assault. Now his five of his former supervisors, police department, and Horry County officials are facing claims from two of the victims, Jane Does 3 and 4, for allegedly failing to prevent years of egregious abuse. Large died in January, 16 months after he was indicted. On Monday, a judge rejected a motion for summary judgment from the defendants and decided the case would move forward with a trial against the Horry County Police Department and Horry County.

A tax plan promoted by North Carolina Senate candidate Thom Tillis will overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy.	The first, Antonio Halili, was the mayor of the much larger Tanauan City, south of Manila. Unlike Bote, Halili had developed both a reputation for having a heavy hand against drug traffickers and negotiating with them. Halili appeared on a more recent Duterte list of elected officials with ties to drug trafficking in 2017. Shortly after Halili’s assassination, Duterte told reporters, “I don’t know who killed him, but I told you don’t [engage in illegal drugs]. … His procession of drug suspects was just a front.”
Prior to this accusation, however, Halili had established a “walk of shame” program where he paraded drug suspects around his city for the public to jeer, leading others in the government to suggest he was killed by drug traffickers in revenge for humiliating their peers.
"Prior to 1962, everybody prayed before school started, and the Bible was the principal textbook in all schools."	"Unlike our forerunners in 1968, those of us living today have access to something they didn't," said Mary Eberstadt, a widely published Catholic writer, "50 years of sociological, psychological, medical, and other evidence about the revolution's fallout." Some of the lines in Humanae Vitae, when stripped of mid-20th century cultural references, find echoes in contemporary concerns about nonconsensual sexual relations. "A man who grows accustomed to the use of contraceptive methods may forget the reverence due to a woman," the pope wrote, "... and reduce her to a mere instrument of his own desires." "This document that has been so controversial and in many places reviled," Eberstadt says, "actually called the shots on what the future would look like better than any other single source I could think of." Revisionist views of the 1968 encyclical have even taken hold among some Catholics who have not abided by its teaching.
"A DeKalb sewer project will create up to 4,000 direct jobs per year at peak production, many of which will be set aside exclusively for DeKalb residents."	Sixteen years ago, the Commons select committee for transport, local government and the regions reported on new towns in general, but this could could easily have been about Telford in particular:
"While many new towns have been economically successful, most are now experiencing major problems. Their design is inappropriate for the 21st century. Their infrastructure is aging at the same rate and many have social and economic problems...
"The new towns are no longer new and many of the quickly-built houses have reached the end of their design life.

These created car dependency and are now not considered sustainable.
"Romney said ""'No' to in-state tuition"" for illegal immigrants."	In one case, Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion that illegal immigrants do not have the same bargaining rights as American citizens and legal workers. “… an illegal immigrant worker is not an ’employee’ under the NLRA for the simple reason that, ever since 1986, an illegal immigrant worker is not a lawful ’employee’ in the United States,” Kavanaugh wrote. In another case, Kavanaugh noted that American multi-national corporations do not have the right to import foreign workers. The Circuit judge explained, “Under the provision of the immigration laws at issue here, mere economic expediency does not authorize an employer to displace American workers for foreign workers.”
Prominent conservative Ann Coulter has also called for Trump to nominate Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, arguing that other judges such as Thomas Hardiman and Raymond Kethledge “are open borders zealots.”

LONDON — Over the past century American and British troops have fought side-by-side in two World Wars, Korea and the conflicts in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan. But some lawmakers and experts in the United Kingdom are warning that the British military could soon be seen as irrelevant by the United States unless it receives a colossal funding boost.

"Says Steve Kagen promised us jobs, voting for the $787 billion stimulus. Cost: another 77,000 jobs lost."	That will allow Trump to argue that his tough approach to trade is paying off. There are reasons why the US economy is currently strong, but none of them have anything to do with tariffs on imports. In part, it is the lagged effect of a buoyant global economy in 2017; in part it is explained by tax cuts and the stimulus still being provided by only gently rising interest rates. Mickey Levy, chief US economist for Berenberg, says Trump’s deregulation agenda has been a factor in boosting America’s underlying growth rate.

Romney would turn Medicare into a voucher program.	“That was a very sad day for the country when that vote was cast,” Trump said in June. But Republican lawmakers dispute arguments suggesting their efforts to undo ObamaCare have been totally fruitless. “We eliminated the individual mandate that said that people had to buy government-approved insurance,” said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo. “In a sense, it blew a big hole in ObamaCare.”
There’s a potential electoral landmine ahead for Republicans hoping to keep their majorities in the House and Senate, though: premium increases. “We’re going to get another round right before the election, which is something the GOP is nervous about,” said John C.

Ramos, the man suspected of killing five people during an attack on the Capital Gazette newspaper last week in Annapolis, Maryland, sent multiple threatening letters prior to the shooting, police revealed on Monday ... The paper’s former attorney gave police mail he received at his law office on Monday, the newspaper's former publisher Thomas Marquardt told The Baltimore Sun. One of those documents, dated June 28 – the same day as the shooting – allegedly included a letter from Ramos in which he said he was en route to the paper “with the objective of killing every person present.”
The letter was written in the form of a “Motion for Reconsideration” by a Maryland court following a 2016 refusal to hear Ramos’ defamation case that he had filed against the outlet. That stemmed from a 2011 column published in the paper about a criminal harassment charge against Ramos that was filed by a former high school classmate. “You were too cowardly to confront those lies, and this is your receipt,” he allegedly wrote.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
"According to (Barack) Obamas newest unconstitutionally enacted law, health care professionals are now required to violate HIPAA privacy laws and submit medical data to the government, which is then used as justification for gun confiscation."	While most of these foreign doctors are perfectly capable, a disproportionate number turn out to be incompetent, with more than half of doctors subject to ‘fitness to practice’ investigation by the General Medical Council (GMC) being non-British. Critics suggest that plundering the Third World of clinicians rather than training British talent will disincentivise poor countries from investing in medical training, as the investment is a waste of limited resources if doctors simply leave for Western countries once qualified. However, new Home Secretary Sajid Javid does not appear to be changing course and is actually relaxing immigration controls to recruit more foreign medical personnel. At the same time, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is making it harder to remove doctors who kill their patients from the medical register at the same time, leading to concerns that the Government is facilitating a massive fall in standards.

Mike Huckabee raised taxes on dog groomers!	The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said. Carney said the impact from the president’s use of import tariffs against major trading partners including the EU and China, alongside their retaliatory measures, was already being seen through measures of global exports and manufacturing in recent weeks. “There are some tentative signs that this more hostile and uncertain trading environment may be dampening activity,” he said. Surveys of factory output in the US and the eurozone earlier this week showed firms were facing higher prices as a consequence of the import tariffs, as well as American manufacturers having the longest delivery delays on record.

The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.

In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.

"For every one ESD superintendent position, we can pay for three speech pathologists, or three special needs instructors, or three classroom teachers."	“Regardless of political parties, we need people to make a decision about what’s happening in the classroom,” said Marisol Garcia, vice president of the Arizona Education Association. “To limit ourselves and to say ‘only these people are going to support us’ is just not true.”
Teachers can be at a disadvantage compared to wealthier candidates, who tend to have built-in networks of potential donors. The NEA’s Eskelsen Garcia experienced that firsthand when she ran for Congress in Utah in 1998, recalling mystified looks and wary questions from people trying to figure out who was bankrolling her (she lost to the Republican nominee in the general election). But teachers, especially experienced ones, can benefit from their network of former students and their real-life connection to middle-class voters. “As a teacher married to a teacher, I know what it’s like to work paycheck to paycheck,” said Tom Niermann, a teacher running to unseat Rep. Kevin Yoder (R-Kan.) in suburban Kansas City.

Avenatti's former law firm, Eagan Avenatti LLP, agreed to make the roughly $452,000 tax payment last month in order to resolve a bankruptcy case, but the funds never arrived at the IRS, according to a filing Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, Calif.

Newly appointed public health minister Joe Fitzpatrick said "far too many people" were facing "serious risks to their health" which were "largely avoidable". 'Profound impact'

Over the fireplace at Mingo Creek Craft Distillers, a whiskey purveyor in the small town of Washington, Pennsylvania, a portrait of Alexander Hamilton hangs upside down. With snowy hair and a black velvet jacket, Hamilton wears an impassive look that might be described as hauteur. In 1791, to pay off debts the newly formed United States incurred during the revolutionary war, Hamilton imposed the first federal tax on the people of the region. By taxing their most lucrative product, whiskey, he became what he is here today: a villain representing the excesses of the federal government. The town of Washington is only a six-hour drive from Manhattan, but it’s a world away from the Broadway stage where Hamilton, clad in snug white knickers, enjoys a better reputation.

Spent years playing various roles on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, which oversees the EPA, drafting regulations on chemical safety, air and water pollution and climate change — generally seeking to reduce government regulations on industries that generate greenhouse gases. Served as longtime aide to Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., whom you may recall from the 2015 floor speech in which he rebutted climate change science with a snowball. After leaving Congress, worked for years as a lobbyist for some of the largest coal, chemical and uranium companies in the U.S. — including the uranium mining firm that pushed for the reduction of Bears Ears National Monument, which is near one of its processing facilities.

Female prisoners in Victoria are still subject to “abusive” routine strip searches, a state government watchdog says.

The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

"Says Alison Lundergan Grimes supports Obamacare, which cuts $700 billion from seniors Medicare."	This is just terrible timing all around." Medicaid, an $11 billion, state-federal health plan in Kentucky, covers 1.4 million people, about 600,000 of them children. The federal government provides about 80 percent of the state's Medicaid funds. The cuts to dental and vision benefits were supposed to affect only able-bodied adults, mostly those added to Medicaid under an expansion authorized through the Affordable Care Act.
We borrow money from the Chinese to buy oil from the Saudis.	ZTE is far from alone. China assembles some 90 percent of the world's smartphones, computers and other electronics. But most of the revenue flows to American companies that supply computer chips and other technology. In the broader economy, Chinese banks, airlines, farms and other industries need U.S. technology from jetliners to drugs to software. What Washington welcomes as a source of well-paid jobs, Chinese leaders consider a dangerous dependence.
"Obamacare will provide coverage for abortions, despite the presidents commitment that it would not."	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
Handel endorsed gay adoption in 2003 when she was running for chairwoman of the Fulton County Commission.	No one was ever arrested for the blaze, although Fieseler writes about how investigators keyed into one main suspect in the fire — a disgruntled bar patron who'd been kicked out earlier in the day and had been heard threatening to burn the place down. It wasn't until 2003 that a plaque commemorating the fire's victims was laid. New Orleans was a conflicted place for the gay community at the time of the fire, Fieseler says. In some ways, the city was a haven for the gay community where people could be themselves. But there were also raids on gay bars, harassment, and discrimination: "An individual who was quiet and who was closeted gay, could find companionship, could find love and joy, could have a job, could have a house, so long as this individual never spoke the dreaded H.

The DJT Restaurant, the upscale eatery that bears Trump's initials, was shut down for several hours following a November 2012 inspection at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. That inspection, conducted four years before Trump won the White House, cited 51 demerits for such violations as keeping food items well past their expiration dates.
President Barack Obama met with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani.	Austria plans to revoke the legal immunity of an Iranian diplomat who is suspected of involvement in a plot to bomb an Iranian opposition rally in France, officials said Tuesday. The Iranian government was notified that the man's diplomatic status would be canceled within 48 hours unless Tehran does so first, Matthias Forenbacher, a spokesman for Austria's foreign minister, told The Associated Press. The diplomat, Assadollah Assadi, was detained Sunday near the German city of Aschaffenburg on a European arrest warrant after a couple with Iranian roots was stopped in Belgium and authorities reported finding powerful explosives in their car. The web site of the Austrian Foreign Ministry lists Assadi as a counselor at the Iranian Embassy in Vienna. Iran's ambassador was summoned to the ministry Monday and asked to "contribute to clarifying the situation," Forenbacher said.
"The church Barack Obama belongs to has a ""nonnegotiable commitment to Africa."""	The number of predominantly Christian people killed in Nigeria by Muslim Fulani terrorists in the first six months of this year has dwarfed the fatalities carried out by the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL)-affiliated Boko Haram, a non-governmental organization (NGO) based in the African country revealed this week. In one weekend last month (June 23 and 24), the Fulani stormed nearly a dozen Christian-majority villages in Nigeria’s Plateau state, using machetes and firearms to massacre at least 200 people, including women and children. Referring to the Plateau incident in an article published by Nigeria’s Daily Post, the NGO, known as the International Society for Civil Liberties and the Rule of Law (Intersociety), noted Monday that the fatalities from the Fulani massacre could reach 300, making it one of the deadliest by any group in Nigeria. Intersociety explains:
The total death toll in Plateau State following the 23rd and 24th June 2018 coordinated attacks and killings in eleven villages may most likely have hit 300, from its present 250, out of which 218 bodies have been recovered and buried in mass graves. The activists on the ground said dozens of people are still missing after the head count was carried out.
Says he voted to remove Common Core from our schools.	Some immigrant U.S. Army reservists and recruits who enlisted in the military with a promised path to citizenship are being abruptly discharged, the Associated Press has learned. The AP was unable to quantify how many men and women who enlisted through the special recruitment program have been booted from the Army, but immigration attorneys say they know of more than 40 who have been discharged or whose status has become questionable, jeopardizing their futures. "It was my dream to serve in the military," said reservist Lucas Calixto, a Brazilian immigrant who filed a lawsuit against the Army last week. "Since this country has been so good to me, I thought it was the least I could do to give back to my adopted country and serve in the United States military." Some of the service members say they were not told why they were being discharged.

He then ignited the fluid. VETERAN PROTESTING TREATMENT BY VA SETS HIMSELF ON FIRE NEAR GEORGIA STATE CAPITOL, POLICE SAY

"After shedding jobs for more than 10 years, our manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past three."	Those factories are the core of an American operation that employs about 136,000 people, but they're also dependent on components sourced overseas for reasons of cost or availability. About 70 percent of the parts in a U.S.-built Camry, the country's best-selling car, come from domestic suppliers. Toyota on June 27 said that Trump's threatened 25 percent tariff on automotive imports would add $1,800 to the price of each sedan. The carmaker's warning of the dangers of tit-for-tat tariffs was just one of many. German lighting manufacturer Osram Licht's shares plunged 22 percent Thursday after it announced a weaker outlook due to trade tensions.

Scott Pruitt, who has finally stepped down as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency after a long-rumbling corruption scandal, rose to public prominence on the back of a series of increasingly outlandish ethical controversies. Scott Pruitt resigns: Trump's scandal-ridden EPA chief steps down Read more
From lobbying fast food company Chick-fil-A on behalf of his wife, to demanding his staff acquire a mattress from a Trump Hotel – not to mention the millions of taxpayer dollars spent on security, first-class travel and soundproof booths – Pruitt’s behavior clashed spectacularly with any pretense of Trump’s pledge to “drain the swamp” in Washington. But the lasting legacy of the former Oklahoma attorney general – who was picked by Trump after crusading against what he called the EPA’s “activist agenda” – is likely to be felt in the systematic weakening of environmental regulations. While not as eye-catching as, for example, his demand that his official vehicle use sirens so he could reach a French restaurant on time, Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left behind a demoralized agency where staff fret that their ability to protect public health has been diminished. A staunch ally of oil and gas companies, Pruitt stacked EPA advisory boards with industry representatives and sought to set aside whole troves of research that link pollution to various illnesses.

"Fifty-one percent -- that is, a majority of American households -- paid no income tax in 2009. Zero. Zip. Nada."	Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.

Avenatti's former law firm, Eagan Avenatti LLP, agreed to make the roughly $452,000 tax payment last month in order to resolve a bankruptcy case, but the funds never arrived at the IRS, according to a filing Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, Calif.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.
Says five studies show his tax plan can cut rates and still bring the same revenue without raising taxes on the middle class.	They include the United States withdrawing its 28,500 troops in South Korea, ending its military drills with South Korea and stop bringing in strategic assets such as aircraft carriers and nuclear-capable bombers. North Korea hasn't repeated such specific demands since entering disarmament talks earlier this year, raising optimism that the country truly appeared to seek to improve ties with the United States. After the summit, Trump suspended annual military training with South Korea that the North has called an invasion rehearsal. But North Korea still prefers a step-by-step disarmament process with reciprocal concessions and benefits from the United States for each of the North's denuclearization steps. The ultimate rewards North Korea wants range from the easing or lifting of American-led international sanctions, the signing of a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, the establishment of diplomatic ties and the pulling out of U.S. troops in South Korea, experts say.

"Today, American companies have nearly $2 trillion sitting on their balance sheets."	That will allow Trump to argue that his tough approach to trade is paying off. There are reasons why the US economy is currently strong, but none of them have anything to do with tariffs on imports. In part, it is the lagged effect of a buoyant global economy in 2017; in part it is explained by tax cuts and the stimulus still being provided by only gently rising interest rates. Mickey Levy, chief US economist for Berenberg, says Trump’s deregulation agenda has been a factor in boosting America’s underlying growth rate. Evidence from Barack Obama’s presidency shows how protectionist policies can backfire.

In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.

"Under Lee Fisher Ohio has lost nearly 400,000 jobs."	Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) trashed the June jobs report — even though it showed rapid job growth, rising wages, and low unemployment. The report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that employers created 213,000 new jobs in June — 22,000 more than economists had expected. Manufacturing jobs in particular rose by 36,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.
The name Frank has risen in popularity by 20 percent since the debut of House of Cardson Netflix.	In addition, a group of incumbent Democrats – including U.S. Rep. Brian Higgins of New York and Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania – say they won’t back Pelosi for another term as party leader. "Our leadership is out of touch with what is going on, not only in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan but in Cheektowaga, West Seneca, Hamburg, Orchard Park and Lancaster," Higgins told the Buffalo News, referring to swing states that voted for Donald Trump in 2016, as well as municipalities near Buffalo. "Our leadership is out of touch with what is going on ... in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan ... " - U.S. Rep. Brian Higgins, D-N.Y.
Perhaps the biggest blow to Pelosi’s future prospects occurred last Tuesday in New York City, when 28-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeated longtime U.S. Rep. Joseph Crowley, 56, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. To many political watchers, it suggested that Democratic voters have grown tired of the party’s old guard and want a new generation of leaders. But Pelosi quickly dismissed Ocasio-Cortez’s upset victory as a “one district” fluke – a comment that may serve only to further inspire the younger, more far-left candidates seeking to move on Pelosi and her contemporaries.

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has promoted 16,900 soldiers as a reward for their "loyalty". The promotion comes amid a worsening economic and political crisis during which opposition politicians have called on the armed forces to side "with the people". Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino said those promoted had been "loyal to the constitutionally elected president". He also praised them "for respecting human rights". The promotion comes just 10 days after the UN human rights body released a report saying that Venezuelan security forces had carried out hundreds of arbitrary killings.
Foreign companies in the United States have a significantly higher unionization rate than other companies overall.	This was particularly an issue for Pruitt’s former executive scheduler Sydney Hupp, who often had to shell out for Pruitt’s trips. Hupp was also asked by Pruitt to speak with staff at one of Trump’s hotels, believing he could get a deal on a second-hand mattress they were selling. Pruitt remained miserly even when he was abusing his position to get a good deal. He fell behind on the rental payments on the condo he was getting on the cheap and eventually had to be evicted and the locks were changed.

Kinner may have wanted to “extract vengeance” for being kicked out by a tenant who took him in, Police Chief Bill Bones said at a press conference on Sunday. The woman who took Kinner in was not harmed and was not at the residence at the time of the attack. Kinner assaulted the children at the party after he was unable to find the woman, police said, adding his motive was still under investigation.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
"The John McCain Twitter account has more than 1.1 million followers. The official White House Twitter account has only about 830,000."	The program, also known as a white hat operation, was part of a broader plan to get the company to treat disinformation campaigns by governments differently than it did more traditional problems such as spam, which is aimed at tricking individual users as opposed to shaping the political climate in an entire country, according to these people. Harvey said she had not heard of the operation. Some executives initially were reluctant to act aggressively against suspected fake accounts and raised questions about the legality of doing so, said the people familiar with internal company debates. In November, one frustrated engineer sought to illustrate the severity of the problem by buying thousands of fake followers for a Twitter manager, said two people familiar with the episode.

Teddy Roosevelt hopped on whistle stop tour after whistle stop tour where he was able to drop into rural and suburban communities alike to deliver short, pre-packaged speeches that local papers would usually print verbatim.

Franklin Roosevelt revolutionized and heightened the stature of the office with his fireside chats, that brought his message over the heads of the pesky press corps and directly into the living rooms of the American people. But, though it would have been seen as a scoop, even the reporters covering Lyndon B. Johnson had the good sense not to report on every turd he dropped in their presence. While the founders envisioned a government that moved slowly and methodically, today’s Wi-Fi-enabled political discourse is demanding the opposite.

But late on Saturday U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin of Massachusetts ordered the U.S. government to extend the aid for hotel vouchers to at least check-out time on July 4. At the hearing, he could decide whether to extend it further. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has said 1,722 families are currently receiving aid under its housing program, 585 of whom reside in Central Florida motels. FEMA said in a statement on Sunday it was aware of the judge’s decision and was contacting vendors to comply with the court order. U.S. Democratic Representative Darren Soto, whose Kissimmee district includes Puerto Ricans facing eviction, said a displaced family can either remain in the hotel with the looming fear of losing aid or take a free flight back to the island.

He said contracts obtained under energy reforms passed under President Enrique Pena Nieto will be scrutinized for any corruption or illegality, but otherwise contracts will be honored. "There will be no confiscation or expropriation of assets. ... Eradicating corruption will be the principal mission," he said. Lopez Obrador also spoke of reducing Mexican immigration to the United States through economic development. "Mexicans will be able ... to work and be happy where they were born," he said.
"Under President Obama, U.S. security funding for Israel is at an all-time high."	Iraqi Christian leaders praised U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration this week for keeping the pledge to help victims of the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) genocide campaign against ethnoreligious minority groups in the Middle East. “Our hopes are high now that this delegation will bring some changes. We especially appreciate the efforts of Vice President [Mike] Pence and USAID [U.S. Agency for International Development] to have them deeply involved in this situation,” Archbishop Bashar Warda of Iraqi Kurdistan’s capital Erbil told the Catholic News Service (CNS). In October 2017, the Trump administration fulfilled the vice president’s promise to “stop funding ineffective relief efforts at the United Nations,” choosing instead to provide tens of millions of dollars directly through USAID to Christians, Yazidis, and other religious minorities in Iraq. “USAID has provided $10 million to various charities, including Catholic Relief Services [CRS] and Heartland Alliance, to help Christians and Yazidis rebuild their homes, after multitudes were killed or driven out by IS in 2014 and subsequent years.

U.S. Government lawyers are slamming one of President Donald Trump's most prominent critics, attorney Michael Avenatti, over nearly half a million dollars in unpaid federal taxes owed by his former firm. Avenatti's former law firm, Eagan Avenatti LLP, agreed to make the roughly $452,000 tax payment last month in order to resolve a bankruptcy case, but the funds never arrived at the IRS, according to a filing Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, Calif.

Says Milwaukee County Parks director Sue Black has not received a pay raise in five years.	Because it is also a flood plain, the project’s 989,000 solar panels will be mounted on frames 12ft tall – the height of a double-decker bus. Unlike most solar farms, Cleve Hill Solar Park’s panels will not all face south, but east and west in a continuous zig-zag. The effect, say the scheme’s opponents, will be to turn green meadows into something resembling a colossal factory roof. Economically and environmentally the scheme makes no sense whatsoever. Apart from ruining a huge swathe of countryside and killing or displacing all the local wildlife, it will do little for Britain’s energy needs.
"Says Romney wrote in the first edition of his book that his health care plan should be expanded nationwide and then, You took it out of your book."	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”

While the US tariffs aim to cut down the trade deficit, there are worries about how China's retaliatory tariffs will hit the US economy. The US Chamber of Commerce says some states will have billions of dollars worth of exports at risk. States such as Louisiana export about $5.7bn of goods to China. Several southern states, many of which also backed Trump in the election, also risk being hit.

For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.

Jaguar Land Rover, Britain's biggest carmaker with 40,000 employees, cautioned this week that a bad deal would slash its profits by £1.2 billion ($1.6 billion) a year. Airbus (EADSF) and BMW (BMWYY) also issued dire warnings. The plan announced Friday acknowledges that banking and other UK service industries, which make up the vast majority of the UK economy, would lose some access to European markets. But Britain's biggest business lobby group, the Confederation of British Industry, welcomed Friday's announcement as a "good starting point." "This is a genuine confidence boost and the prime minister deserves credit for delivering a unified approach" said Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director general, in a statement.
Abraham Lincoln visited and some say even danced in (the Ohio Senate) chamber.	Over the fireplace at Mingo Creek Craft Distillers, a whiskey purveyor in the small town of Washington, Pennsylvania, a portrait of Alexander Hamilton hangs upside down. With snowy hair and a black velvet jacket, Hamilton wears an impassive look that might be described as hauteur. In 1791, to pay off debts the newly formed United States incurred during the revolutionary war, Hamilton imposed the first federal tax on the people of the region. By taxing their most lucrative product, whiskey, he became what he is here today: a villain representing the excesses of the federal government. The town of Washington is only a six-hour drive from Manhattan, but it’s a world away from the Broadway stage where Hamilton, clad in snug white knickers, enjoys a better reputation.

Scott Pruitt is out but his impact on the environment will be felt for years
Scott Pruitt, who has finally stepped down as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency after a long-rumbling corruption scandal, rose to public prominence on the back of a series of increasingly outlandish ethical controversies. Scott Pruitt resigns: Trump's scandal-ridden EPA chief steps down Read more
From lobbying fast food company Chick-fil-A on behalf of his wife, to demanding his staff acquire a mattress from a Trump Hotel – not to mention the millions of taxpayer dollars spent on security, first-class travel and soundproof booths – Pruitt’s behavior clashed spectacularly with any pretense of Trump’s pledge to “drain the swamp” in Washington. But the lasting legacy of the former Oklahoma attorney general – who was picked by Trump after crusading against what he called the EPA’s “activist agenda” – is likely to be felt in the systematic weakening of environmental regulations. While not as eye-catching as, for example, his demand that his official vehicle use sirens so he could reach a French restaurant on time, Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left behind a demoralized agency where staff fret that their ability to protect public health has been diminished. A staunch ally of oil and gas companies, Pruitt stacked EPA advisory boards with industry representatives and sought to set aside whole troves of research that link pollution to various illnesses.
"The Central Falls School system spent $100,000 on a time clock."	Private, non-residential building fell 0.3 percent. Economists are forecasting that construction spending will contribute to overall growth this year even though interest rates are rising. A lack of inventory has stymied homebuyers and pushed home prices higher as demand for existing and new homes has surged. Last month the Commerce Department reported that housing starts rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.35 million, the strongest pace since July 2007, thanks to a surge of building in the Midwest. Even as government budgets have tightened, construction of public projects in May rose 0.7 percent to $304.1 billion, the highest since October 2010.

"If the mayor were really serious about supporting Phillys schoolchildren and handling our citys looming fiscal crisis, he could begin by slashing the size of his own administration, which is already 45 percent larger than his predecessors and 40 percent more costly."	Local authorities have reached the point where relentless financial cutbacks are putting the wellbeing of vulnerable adults and children at risk, the Conservative leader of the Local Government Association (LGA) has warned. The Tory peer Lord Porter said that after eight years of austerity during which £16bn has been stripped from municipal budgets in England, councils risked being “damaged beyond recognition” and communities depleted of vital services. An £8bn black hole in council budgets would open up by 2023 unless ministers stepped in to close the gap between spiralling demand for adult and children’s social care services and shrinking town hall incomes, he said. “We’ve reached a point where councils will no longer be able to support our residents as they expect, including our most vulnerable,” Porter added. As well as problems coping with demand for services for elderly and disabled adults, the LGA says councils are struggling with an explosion in the number of children in care, and a rising bill for 80,000 homeless families placed in temporary housing.
The top 1/10th of 1 percent today in America owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.	A new USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll about patriotism, pegged to this week's celebration of the Fourth of July, finds an overwhelming majority of those surveyed — 90 percent — say they are proud to be Americans. But they split almost down the middle, 42 percent to 39 percent, when asked whether they are proud of America right now. Not surprisingly, the split was along partisan lines: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. There was bipartisan agreement on one thing: Across party lines, roughly seven in 10 agree with the statement, "I feel fatigued watching the news." Elsewhere in politics

75 percent of the jobs created in the state of Ohio are created in small business. They are not created by huge corporations and those who are very wealthy.	Small businesses hired workers at a slower pace in June, the second straight month of weakening job gains despite an overall healthy economy. Payroll company ADP said Thursday it counted 29,000 new jobs at its customers with 49 or fewer employees. This marks a decline from small business job gains of 46,000 in May and 50,000 in April. So far this year, small businesses have been creating on average 46,000 jobs a month. ADP reported that overall private employers added 177,00 jobs last month, a slight drop-off from the average this year of 202,667 a month as companies say they're having a tougher time finding skilled workers.

Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb.

Right on schedule, the presidential motorcade arrived at the Trump National Golf Club in suburban Virginia in the late morning, the middle of a day that also has the president tweeting and hosting a military-themed picnic later at the White House.

On changing the rules governing judicial conflicts of interest	Straight-A students are being turned away from British medical schools and forced to pay for training in Eastern Europe, while the National Health Service (NHS) plunders the Third World for already-trained doctors instead. The Daily Mail spoke to a number of star students who earned top A-levels and supplemented their CVs with spells volunteering at local GP surgeries, overseas clinics, hospices, and pharmacies — and even earned degrees in related fields such as Biomedical Science — who were turned away from British medical schools, despite the NHS facing a shortfall of some 10,000 doctors. Department of Health and Social Care figures show that only 6,000 of 18,000 medical school applicants were awarded places last year — with many of the 6,000 likely going to foreign applicants, who have often been favoured over British applicants. In fact, the Mail found that so many talented would-be medical students were being rejected that a cottage industry of English-language medical schools in countries such as Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Armenia, and Georgia have sprung up to cater to them — but even this option is not available to youngsters who cannot afford the fees.

"We continue to add renewables to our system, but they have to make sense," Burke said. "It's not really about a target, it's about what makes sense for our customers' usage and what makes rates affordable and what keeps our system reliable." Thirty-two states with renewable standards didn't have, on average, a correlated rate increase, according to Wesley Hersche, an associate director of research with Arizona State University's Global Security Initiative. "These issues involve a complex interaction of factors, and we should be careful not to oversimplify things," Hersche wrote in April.

It is legal in Ohio to fire an employee or evict a tenant just for being gay.	No one was ever arrested for the blaze, although Fieseler writes about how investigators keyed into one main suspect in the fire — a disgruntled bar patron who'd been kicked out earlier in the day and had been heard threatening to burn the place down. It wasn't until 2003 that a plaque commemorating the fire's victims was laid. New Orleans was a conflicted place for the gay community at the time of the fire, Fieseler says. In some ways, the city was a haven for the gay community where people could be themselves. But there were also raids on gay bars, harassment, and discrimination: "An individual who was quiet and who was closeted gay, could find companionship, could find love and joy, could have a job, could have a house, so long as this individual never spoke the dreaded H.

This isn't the first time Cohen has done something Trump-related. The actor interviewed Trump in 2003 for HBO's "Da Ali G Show," where Cohen tried to get him to invest in “an ice cream glove.”
In October 2012, after Cohen's ash stunt, Trump tweeted, "I never fall for scams. I am the only person who immediately walked out of my ‘Ali G’ interview." Trump's scam-dar might be on the fritz: On June 28, former Howard Stern sidekick "Stuttering" John Melendez announced via Twitter that he successfully prank-called President Trumpon Air Force One by impersonating Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), who was acquitted of accepting bribes earlier this year. Melendez added that he'd even passed a phone interview with the president's son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner to suss out what he was calling about (he claimed it was about separating immigrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border).
Uber and other ride-share firms are not required to carry auto insurance under Georgia law.	President Donald Trump is not responsible for the killing of journalists in Annapolis last week. His belittling of the press — his “enemy of the American people” taunts, his promises to roll back libel laws, his fomenting rage toward specific journalists at rallies — is worth mentioning within the context of the murders, because it speaks to a larger concern that last Thursday’s attack on The Capital Gazette won’t be an isolated incident. Journalists, many of whom already risk their lives covering war and violence, many of whom receive death threats regularly, feel understandable jitters about a leader who tries to turn the American public against us, particularly when we watch a member of that public shoot up a newsroom and end five lives. It’s reckless and inaccurate, though, to pin the shootings on Trump. The suspect swore an oath to kill a Capital writer who wrote about him in 2011.

But Moira Brown, the marine biologist who reported the whale sighting, said temporary fishing bans can do more harm than good. Conservationists like her need the help of fishermen to protect these highly-endangered animals, and heavy-handed, reactionary measures makes them less, not more, likely to cooperate, she said. “This is not an easy issue,” said Brown, who is one of Canada’s top experts on right whales. “I don’t want to lose that long history of working together ...

The woman who took Kinner in was not harmed and was not at the residence at the time of the attack. Kinner assaulted the children at the party after he was unable to find the woman, police said, adding his motive was still under investigation.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
Says John Boehner admits we are not going to be any different than weve been by returning to the same failed economic policies that wrecked our economy.	Delivering a speech in Newcastle on Thursday, he said: “At the moment, protectionism is largely just talk (and tweets). But what if rhetoric becomes reality?”
Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.

Nielsen founded her own consulting firm, called Sunesis Consulting; she brought on a Bush administration colleague, Elizabeth Neumann, as managing partner, and eventually expanded the suburban Washington firm to 15 people. She continued consulting on cybersecurity issues, becoming a senior fellow at The George Washington University’s Center for Cyber & Homeland Security, and working on reports and presentations on that issue and others for the World Economic Forum—the Swiss nonprofit that puts on an annual summit for global economic heavyweights in Davos, Switzerland. ***
While still running her own consulting firm in late 2016, Nielsen volunteered to advise the Trump transition team on homeland security policy. She met John Kelly during that time, and he tapped her to assist him—also as a volunteer—in his confirmation process for DHS secretary.
We have 50 state lobbyists that just lobby the Legislature for money every year.	Corporate America couldn’t hire Republican lobbyists fast enough after President Donald Trump’s election gave the GOP unified control of Washington. Now there are signs that Democrats are back in demand. Companies and trade groups are trying to hire congressional staffers with ties to influential House Democrats four months ahead of the midterm elections, in which Democrats are expected to pick up seats and potentially retake control of the House. Lobbyists are helping their clients meet with the Democrats who would become committee chairs if the party does win back the chamber. And trade groups are talking to members about what to expect from a Democratic takeover.
"In Atlanta, since 1994 when the Seven Deadly Sins (mandatory minimum sentences) took effect, the violent crime rate has dropped 62 percent."	The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year. The prison population has soared by 20% since the 2015 report. Almost half of all prisoners released reoffend and return to prison within two years. “As the government tightens sentencing and bail conditions, and builds more prisons, there is no indication that these trends are likely to change,” Glass said.

A free Interrail ticket for teenagers to discover Europe may sound too good to be true - and for thousands of hopefuls that has proved to be the case. The EU has now closed a controversial lottery that allocated 15,000 free tickets to 18-year-olds; but more than 100,000 applied. The window for applications was 12-26 June. Those lucky enough to get a ticket can spend a month visiting up to four other European countries by rail, between 9 July and 30 September. In future, the European Commission plans to expand the scheme to enable 1.5 million 18-year-olds to visit their European neighbours, funded by €700m (£619m; $815m) of EU money.

We adopted the modern Social Security system at a time when the average person died before they were old enough to get Social Security.	Appearing in a state he dominated in 2016, Trump cast Tester as a "liberal Democrat," railing against his voting record on issues like abortion, immigration and taxes. While Tester opposed Trump's first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, and the Republican tax bill, he also took flak from the left for a bill easing the rules on banks. Tester tried to counter Trump's visit by taking out a full-page ad Thursday in more than a dozen newspapers across the state thanking him for signing 16 bills the Democrat sponsored or co-sponsored. Trump rallied in Great Falls to boost the candidacy of Tester's Republican challenger, state Auditor Matt Rosendale, who is seeking to deny Tester a third term and give Montana an all-Republican congressional delegation. The president has made the Montana race a priority as he hopes to help Republicans tighten the party's hold on the Senate.

He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.

We know that Sunday mornings have usually been given over to conservative white men.	Billions of dollars of investment funds routinely shift from one country to another.

But Crowley’s most challenging hurdle is a stark reality for all Democrats this cycle: falling voter turnout. A new Pew Research study found that while the youngest generations, including Generation X, Millennials, and the post-Millennial generation, make up of the bulk of eligible voters in 2018, if turnout outcomes from the 2014 midterms persist, they are less inclined to comprise of the majority of voters who cast ballots this November.

XI ASSERTS TERRITORIAL CLAIMS IN MEETING WITH US DEFENSE SECRETARY
Chinese President Xi Jinping strongly asserted China's determination to defend territory it claims, including in the South China Sea, in a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. While the tone of Mattis' visit to Beijing was largely upbeat, Xi made sure to reinforce his reputation as a fervent nationalist when it comes to issues of sovereignty. Though Xi gave no specifics in his statement, he was largely seen as indicating the South China Sea as well as self-governing Taiwan. China also claims territory held by India and uninhabited East China Sea islands controlled by Japan.

Attorney General Eric Holder is involved in the dismissal of the criminal charges against the New Black Panther Party for voter intimidation	In what ways should these concerns shape congressional expectations about transparency of the nominee vetting process and the standards for recusal in cases involving President Trump’s legal affairs? Consider first the not-unlikely prospect of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who has developed a robust view of presidential immunity from legal process fully consistent with some of the more aggressive positions of the president and his legal team. Kavanaugh has written that:
Congress might consider a law exempting a President—while in office—from criminal prosecution and investigation, including from questioning by criminal prosecutors or defense counsel. Criminal investigations targeted at or revolving around a President are inevitably politicized by both their supporters and critics. As I have written before, “no Attorney General or special counsel will have the necessary credibility to avoid the inevitable charges that he is politically motivated—whether in favor of the President or against him, depending on the individual leading the investigation and its results.” The indictment and trial of a sitting President, moreover, would cripple the federal government, rendering it unable to function with credibility in either the international or domestic arenas.
"Says the state share of Texas public education spending increased 82 percent over the past decade, reaching $20 billion in 2009."	Hamilton, the Republican state lawmaker who beat the incumbent Karnes, won with a mix of support from teachers and other unions. While Karnes sparred with teachers during the strike, Hamilton took a moderate position. He aligned with teachers unions by opposing state right-to-work legislation and the proposed repeal of prevailing wage laws for public construction projects. The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.

I'm glad for the wording of it (an ethics report on corporate-sponsored Congressional trips) because clearly the wording exonerates me.	The report also said that Strzok repeatedly pushed for more aggressive action in the Clinton probe. "The conduct by these employees cast a cloud over the entire FBI investigation and sowed doubt about the FBI’s work," the report concluded. "The damage caused by these employees’ actions extends far beyond the scope of the (Clinton) investigation and goes to the heart of the FBI’s reputation for neutral fact finding and political independence." Goelman, in an op-ed in USA TODAY last month, said Strzok has become the victim of "political gamesmanship" by Congress and President Trump, who has repeatedly tweeted about Strzok as evidence of bias by the FBI and Justice Department. "They have spent months cynically taking these texts out of context and saying that one- or two-word snippets somehow prove that the FBI investigations of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the Russia probe itself, were biased," Goelman wrote.

President Donald Trump in May said that drugmakers would soon announce “massive” price cuts, and his administration rolled out a plan to bring down the cost of medicines. But the companies don’t appear to have gotten that message. Bayer raised the price of two cancer drugs by hundreds of dollars in May and Novartis followed by boosting four pricey treatments in June. Pfizer, one of the largest U.S. pharmaceutical companies, announced increases on more than 41 products this week.

The order says the agency cannot end its Transitional Sheltering Assistance program until at least midnight on Tuesday. The organization is pushing to let families stay another six months.

The Trump administration "will not hesitate” to punish foreign companies that don't comply with sanctions set to be reimposed on Iran in the coming months, a senior State Department official said Monday.

Three of the teens were named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit. Howard told U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Dillon during a status conference Tuesday that all three original plaintiffs are no longer part of the case.

Cuyahoga County passed a program to guarantee a college savings account for every single child who enters kindergarten in this county -- the first county in the United States to do so.	“His ruling was closer to congressional talking points than legal precedent.”
Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center, said that the center doesn’t weigh in on potential judicial appointees, but that open hostility to the agency’s mission would be cause for concern. “Obviously, it would be concerning if there was a justice that was inclined to invalidate the CFPB,” she said. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, renamed the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection under acting director Mick Mulvaney, returned nearly $12 billion to 29 million customers of financial services companies from 2011 to 2017 under its original director, Richard Cordray, an Obama appointee and former Ohio attorney general. But the CFPB’s structure — in fact, its very existence — has been a lightning rod since the agency’s inception. Opponents say not making the CFPB subject to the congressional appropriations process — it’s funded directly by the Federal Reserve — gives it unchecked power; supporters counter that having the central bank as its funding source protects the CFPB from partisan-driven attempts to starve it of resources.

Kelly Ayotte has voted four times against the federal Paycheck Fairness Act.	The president told Fox News that he believes his nominee will get some support from Democrats. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, an abortion rights supporter, is considered one of the key votes on a nominee. She said she wouldn't vote for someone who would overturn Roe v. Wade. "A candidate who would overturn Roe would not be acceptable," she said Sunday on ABC's This Week. Collins, who has previously bucked party lines on other key issues such as health care, said she plans to have an in-depth conversation with the nominee.
One out of every four homeless people on our streets is a veteran.	Watts was transported to a nearby hospital, where 85 to 90 percent of his body was found to have been burned, Georgia State Patrol told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Authorities said Watts, upset with the federal agency designated to aid veterans, attached a homemade incendiary device and fireworks to his body before pouring liquid on himself. He then ignited the fluid. VETERAN PROTESTING TREATMENT BY VA SETS HIMSELF ON FIRE NEAR GEORGIA STATE CAPITOL, POLICE SAY
"It looks like a veteran that was disgruntled with the VA did a personal protest in front of the Capitol which involved gasoline and some fireworks,” Commissioner Mark McDonough, of the Georgia Department of Public Safety, said. The commissioner added a Capitol trooper "actually put him out with his fire extinguisher."

"Education funding of $7,176 per student is a historic level."	Such challenges are a shot across the bow at the administration and DeVos, who is working to redefine a department conceived to advocate for students — not schools or lobbyists seeking financial profits. The debate carries huge significance for U.S. taxpayers, who fund the billions of dollars in student loans and grants DeVos oversees each year. “With Navient bulldozing students on their loans and the Department of Education gone missing in action, California is moving to stop the abuse,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra told NBC News in a statement. The California suit argues that Navient improperly steered financially distressed borrowers — such as single moms and new graduates — into forbearance, costing them thousands of dollars. It specifically targets federal loans that DeVos and Mick Mulvaney, acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, are tasked with policing.
I co-sponsored the Rebuild America Jobs Act for transportation and infrastructure.	Infrastructure is supposed to knit us together as a nation, increasing our personal mobility and economic connectivity, but the politics of infrastructure is increasingly exposing our divides. ***
For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
"Says a new report proves the stimulus supported by N.J. Democrats cost $278,000 per job."	Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
Says its absurd to say theres enough data to establish a link between playing football and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy.	It is Trump’s responsibility, however, to help the nation heal in the aftermath. So it’s important that he reversed course Tuesday and called for the lowering of American flags in honor of the five victims. Trump initially rebuffed Annapolis Mayor Gavin Buckley’s request over the weekend to lower flags to half-staff. READ MORE: In a time of hate, your civility lectures aren't helping anyone »

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

Florida has a law like (Indianas Religious Freedom Restoration Act).	Bishop John Bauerschmidt, who oversees the Middle Tennessee region of the church, stands firmly by his decision not to authorize their use, nor allow clergy within his diocese to officiate the religious ceremonies or permit the weddings on church property. In doing so, the bishop says he is being faithful to his job of guarding the discipline, faith and unity of the church.

"The teaching that Christian marriage is between a man and a woman is reasonable, traditional, and scriptural," Bauerschmidt said in an email. "There really is nothing remarkable about a Christian bishop who holds to this teaching." While Bishops can place limitations on the use of the marriage liturgies, they must refer couples to a willing diocese if they do not authorize them.
The things I said (during the prank call by a blogger posing as GOP contributor David Koch) are the things Ive said publicly all along about the Wisconsin budget debate.

Say photographs of Hillary Clinton at the debate show what could be an earpiece.	But critics say it also underscores how his "America First" foreign policy at times can seem outright reckless, providing ammunition to America's adversaries. The White House declined to comment on the private conversations. But a National Security Council spokesman reiterated that the U.S. will consider all options at its disposal to help restore Venezuela's democracy and bring stability. Under Trump's leadership, the U.S., Canada and European Union have levied sanctions on dozens of top Venezuelan officials, including Maduro himself, over allegations of corruption, drug trafficking and human rights abuses. The U.S. has also distributed more than $30 million to help Venezuela's neighbors absorb an influx of more than 1 million migrants who have fled the country.
Says Joe Biden went to China and said that he sympathized and wouldnt second-guess their one-child policy of forced abortions and sterilizations.	“Some of these articles feature exaggerations or overgeneraliszations [sic]; for example, some claim that China is ‘world No.1’ in certain field.”
The problem with these pieces, the People’s Daily argued in this column, is that “they lack basic facts and deep thought.”
Should Xi implement this reform in the tone of Chinese state media, it would mean a significant change for the typical styles of the nation’s largest publications. In 2017 alone, Chinese state publications proclaimed that the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse scandal proves that “Chinese traditional values” are superior to Western ones; the Soviet Union failed because it lacked “Chinese culture”; and that the West was doomed to fail because Western leaders “always believe in absolute conquest.”
An extensive profile of Xi Jinping in the state outlet Xinhua last year also went out of its way to proclaim that the world is riveted by Xi and his ability to “make things happen,” as evidenced by the “numerous clicks and many thumbs-up on the Internet” his speeches and political commentary garner. The story featured an anecdote about a man who drank some of the ink he was using to translate the Communist Manifesto because “the taste of truth is so sweet.”
Not to be left behind, in December, the People’s Daily proclaimed, “A unique path, a unique theory, a unique system, a unique culture; Xi Jinping’s thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era has developed a rich path for China that has transcended Western-centric theory.”
The growing human rights movement within China has also become one of the most common targets of vitriol for state media. Shortly following the death of Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo last year, the Global Times called Liu and his supporters “losers” and dismissed their lives as a “waste.”
The People’s Daily message this week may be aimed for North Korea as much as it is for China, as Pyongyang prepares for what appears to be inevitable economic profit following dictator Kim Jong-un’s in-person meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. North Korean state media are more vitriolic and exaggerated than their Chinese counterpart, spending much of 2017 threatening a nuclear attack on the United States and sentencing Trump to death.
On whether to seat Roland Burris as the new senator from Illinois.	(Reuters) - A man went on a stabbing spree at a 3-year-old’s birthday party at an apartment complex housing refugee families in Boise on Saturday, injuring nine people, including six children, police said on Sunday. Timmy Kinner, a 30-year-old from Los Angeles who had been staying at the complex, has been arrested, Boise police said. He is not an immigrant and went on the rampage a day after being asked to leave by one of the residents, police said. Kinner was being held without bail at the Ada County jail on 15 charges, including six of injury to a child and nine of aggravated battery, jail records showed. There was no lawyer listed for Kinner in the records.
2014 Federal Tax Refunds To Be Delayed Until October 2015.	A judge ordered federal emergency officials to extend vouchers for temporary hotel housing for nearly 1,700 Puerto Rican hurricane evacuees, saying ending the program could cause irreparable harm. Saturday night's decision came shortly after civil rights group LatinoJustice PRLDEF filed a lawsuit seeking relief for the Puerto Ricans, whose federal housing assistance vouchers were set to expire at midnight Sunday, meaning the evacuees could have been evicted from the hotels. The order says the agency cannot end its Transitional Sheltering Assistance program until at least midnight on Tuesday. The organization is pushing to let families stay another six months. U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin of Massachusetts wrote that ending the program would drain other public resources.
Forty-five states allow open carry of firearms.	A Connecticut man who was assaulted by three juveniles while at work has been sentenced to prison for stabbing one of the attackers. The Connecticut Post reports 21-year-old Jeffrey Sumpter of Bridgeport received 18 months in jail Monday at a Stamford courthouse. The paper reported that Sumpter — who was convicted of felony first-degree assault — also will have to spend three years following his release on probation. If he breaks the law during that time, Sumpter could be made to serve all or part of a 42-month prison sentence. Sumpter was working at a Dunkin’ Donuts in Norwalk last October when he was jumped by three males.
"Obama ""remains silent"" and ""is never asked how he feels about his church honoring Farrakhan."""	President Donald Trump is not responsible for the killing of journalists in Annapolis last week. His belittling of the press — his “enemy of the American people” taunts, his promises to roll back libel laws, his fomenting rage toward specific journalists at rallies — is worth mentioning within the context of the murders, because it speaks to a larger concern that last Thursday’s attack on The Capital Gazette won’t be an isolated incident. Journalists, many of whom already risk their lives covering war and violence, many of whom receive death threats regularly, feel understandable jitters about a leader who tries to turn the American public against us, particularly when we watch a member of that public shoot up a newsroom and end five lives. It’s reckless and inaccurate, though, to pin the shootings on Trump. The suspect swore an oath to kill a Capital writer who wrote about him in 2011.
"When Donald Trump spoke in Phoenix, he looked the audience in the eye and he said no, were building a wall and were deporting everybody. He said, quote, they will all be gone. They will all be gone. This is one of the ones where you can go to the tape on it and see what Donald Trump has said."	I look very much forward to working with him. There is much to be done that will benefit both the United States and Mexico! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 2, 2018
“I think he’s gonna try and help us with border,” Trump told the reporters. He described “unbelievably bad border laws, immigration laws” in the United States, calling them “the weakest in the world, laughed at by everybody in the world.” He contrasted the U.S. immigration laws with “Mexico’s very strong immigration laws.”
Trump suggested that Mexico can help the United States “until we straighten out our immigration laws, which have been bad for many, many years, decades.” He further assured, “We’re gonna have them taken care of.”

"John Edwards never -- has ever from the beginning of his political career has never taken PAC money or the money of Washington lobbyists.

One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. Teachers are also running a ballot measure campaign that would tax the highest income earners for an additional $690 million to spend on schools. “Regardless of political parties, we need people to make a decision about what’s happening in the classroom,” said Marisol Garcia, vice president of the Arizona Education Association. “To limit ourselves and to say ‘only these people are going to support us’ is just not true.”
Teachers can be at a disadvantage compared to wealthier candidates, who tend to have built-in networks of potential donors.

Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall.

While other data on Thursday showed private payrolls rising less than expected last month and a surprise increase in new applications for unemployment benefits last week, overall labor market conditions continue to tighten. The labor market is considered to be near or at full employment, with the jobless rate at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent. The unemployment rate has dropped by three-tenths of a percentage point this year and is near the Federal Reserve’s forecast of 3.6 percent by the end of this year.

But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.

Consider first the not-unlikely prospect of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who has developed a robust view of presidential immunity from legal process fully consistent with some of the more aggressive positions of the president and his legal team. Kavanaugh has written that:
Congress might consider a law exempting a President—while in office—from criminal prosecution and investigation, including from questioning by criminal prosecutors or defense counsel. Criminal investigations targeted at or revolving around a President are inevitably politicized by both their supporters and critics. As I have written before, “no Attorney General or special counsel will have the necessary credibility to avoid the inevitable charges that he is politically motivated—whether in favor of the President or against him, depending on the individual leading the investigation and its results.” The indictment and trial of a sitting President, moreover, would cripple the federal government, rendering it unable to function with credibility in either the international or domestic arenas.

Pentagon Questioned Over Blackout On War Zone Troop Numbers
Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images
For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.

Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
Says Hillary Clintons campaign hasnt been clear about when she wiped herserverof her work emails.	The report also said that Strzok repeatedly pushed for more aggressive action in the Clinton probe. "The conduct by these employees cast a cloud over the entire FBI investigation and sowed doubt about the FBI’s work," the report concluded. "The damage caused by these employees’ actions extends far beyond the scope of the (Clinton) investigation and goes to the heart of the FBI’s reputation for neutral fact finding and political independence." Goelman, in an op-ed in USA TODAY last month, said Strzok has become the victim of "political gamesmanship" by Congress and President Trump, who has repeatedly tweeted about Strzok as evidence of bias by the FBI and Justice Department. "They have spent months cynically taking these texts out of context and saying that one- or two-word snippets somehow prove that the FBI investigations of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the Russia probe itself, were biased," Goelman wrote.

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Sunday that President Donald Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court should not seek to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that enshrined abortion rights in the United States. “Roe v. Wade is a constitutional right that is well-established,” Collins said on “State of the Union” on CNN. “And no less an authority than Chief Justice [John] Roberts said that repeatedly at his confirmation hearing.“
Story Continued Below
Trump last week said he wouldn’t ask potential Supreme Court nominees about abortion rights — a departure from his stance on the campaign trail, when he said he would only nominate justices to the Supreme Court who oppose abortion. “I think what he said as the candidate may not have been informed by the legal advice that he now has,” Collins told Jake Tapper.
Eighty percent of the antibiotics in this country are fed to livestock.	Federal Reserve officials last month said they expect to keep raising interest rates and suggested that by the next year, they could be high enough that they could start slowing growth, according to minutes of their discussion released Thursday. While noting a strong economy, Fed officials appeared vigilant about emerging risks, especially trade tensions, and the dangers of an economy that might overheat. The officials noted heightened concerns from businesses about President Donald Trump's get-tough trade policies and that some executives had already scaled back future spending plans because of the uncertainty. They also said they were monitoring changes in market-set interest rates. A narrowing in the gap between short-term and long-term rates has been an accurate predictor of downturns in the past.
"This year, Eric Cantor has received more money from oil companies than any other member of Congress."	Corporate America couldn’t hire Republican lobbyists fast enough after President Donald Trump’s election gave the GOP unified control of Washington. Now there are signs that Democrats are back in demand. Companies and trade groups are trying to hire congressional staffers with ties to influential House Democrats four months ahead of the midterm elections, in which Democrats are expected to pick up seats and potentially retake control of the House. Lobbyists are helping their clients meet with the Democrats who would become committee chairs if the party does win back the chamber. And trade groups are talking to members about what to expect from a Democratic takeover.
Says Rep. Steve Stockman basically wants gun-filled zones in schools.	The Republican Party is rotting away. The problem is that GOP policies just aren’t popular. Most Americans unsurprisingly oppose climate denial, tax cuts for the wealthy, and putting children (including toddlers) in concentration camps, for example. The Republican Party has thus far managed to continue winning elections by creating “a coalition between racists and plutocrats,” as Paul Krugman put it. The party’s economic policies are aimed at benefitting wealthy individuals and corporations, but that’s a slim segment of the American electorate.
Says military expenditures for the United States are greater than the combined spending of the next 14 largest nations.	Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. LONDON — Over the past century American and British troops have fought side-by-side in two World Wars, Korea and the conflicts in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan. But some lawmakers and experts in the United Kingdom are warning that the British military could soon be seen as irrelevant by the United States unless it receives a colossal funding boost. "There is a concern that the U.K. is falling ever further behind and becoming even more useless from a U.S. point of view," said Andrew Dorman, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a think tank in London.
"The Iran deal says that if any other country tries to undermine (Irans) nuclear program, we have to help them defend themselves against Israel, Egypt, Saudis, our own allies."	Tehran, however, accused the group's own members of staging an attack on itself to damage Iran's attempts at savaging its nuclear deal. Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the landmark sanctions relief deal in May, despite protests by his European allies. Iranian officials are now attempting to convince the other signatories - China, France, Germany, the EU, Russia, and the UK - to remain committed to the deal. Assadollah A is in the hands of German police, and a European arrest warrant has been issued for him.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Fred Knapp/NET News Fred Knapp/NET News
Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.

Police have cordoned off at least five areas, including a park, a church and a pharmacy, where the couple had been before they became sick. Officials said people who had been in the areas around where the pair had been before collapsing should wash their clothes, although they insisted risk of contamination was minimal. The pair is now being treated in the same hospital where Skripal and his daughter spent weeks in critical condition following the attack, which London blamed on Moscow.
The Agriculture Department estimates that roughly 42 percent of the corn crop will be used to make ethanol -- more than the amount of corn used to feed livestock and poultry in the United States.	President Trump had suggested lifting the prohibition, which environmentalists charge would raise levels of ground ozone during warmer months, during his campaign for the White House. Following the news of Mr. Pruitt’s resignation, Mr. Dinneen wrote that there was a “collective sigh of relief coming from the Midwest,” calling the 2019 ethanol quotas “the straw that broke the camel’s back.”
While it is too early to say how the handling of waivers or the treatment of E15 may change under new leadership, one indicator was small losses in affected refiners in early Friday trading and gains in most ethanol producers. CVR Refining, Andeavor and Delek U.S. Holdings , all of which benefited from waivers granted by the EPA, had rallied by 136%, 40% and 92% in the year ended Thursday, respectively. Ethanol companies Pacific Ethanol and Green Plains had fallen by 60% and 14%, respectively. Agricultural lobbyists often portray any easing of the rules as a sop to “big oil,” but that isn’t accurate.
"In 1913, it was legal to mail children."	In an 1873 interview with the Pike County Republican newspaper, Madison Hemings, thesecond son of Thomas Jefferson and his slave Sally Hemings, told a story. It was a story that would confirm the decades of rumors that had circulated since Jefferson ran for president in 1801. Madison Hemings began his recollection of his parent’s taboo relationship with these words:
"But during that time (in Paris) my mother became Mr. Jefferson's concubine, and when he was called back home she was [pregnant] by him. He desired to bring my mother back to Virginia with him, but she demurred.
"Tonight in Ohio, more people came out to vote for Barack Obama in an unopposed race than voted for (Mitt) Romney and (Rick) Santorum combined."	"The president of the republic and his government will be absolutely respectful and support the authorities that are elected," Pena Nieto told reporters. Hovering over the election is the specter of vote fraud, though electoral officials deny it is a possibility with the modern balloting technology and institutions now in place. In both of Lopez Obrador's previous two presidential losses he alleged fraud. In his first loss — by a mere 0.56 percent to conservative Felipe Calderon in 2006 — his supporters held months-long protests in Mexico City and he referred to himself as "the legitimate president." His allies are warning even before Sunday's presidential vote that there better not be any funny business.
"Democrats compare the infrastructure programs in the stimulus to the Eisenhower interstate program, ""but he proposed a $500 billion highway system, and they're going to put $30 billion"" into roads and bridges."	Infrastructure is supposed to knit us together as a nation, increasing our personal mobility and economic connectivity, but the politics of infrastructure is increasingly exposing our divides. ***
For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
Congressman (Tom) Cotton is the only Arkansan in Congress -- Democrat or Republican -- to vote against disaster relief five times.	He aligned himself with most of his Democratic colleagues against Gina Haspel, Trump's pick for CIA director, arguing that her record on enhanced interrogation techniques was unacceptable. And instead of focusing on a politically safe issue in his maiden Senate floor speech, Jones struck a nerve by calling for a dialogue on gun violence after the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida. In addition, during the campaign, Jones made no secret of his desire to protect LGBTQ rights and to support a woman's right to abortion. It's those kinds of positions that have made him a darling of Alabama's progressive minority — and somewhat of a public enemy among the state's conservative majority. Jones has introduced four pieces of legislation — none of any huge significance — since he arrived on Capitol Hill, including two agriculture bills, one that would expand access to capital for rural job creators and the last seeking to mandate an annual Medicaid expansion review.
The U.S. Navy has sailed ships around the world for 60 years with nuclear power plants on them and we've never had an accident.	North Korea is believed to be constructing an operational nuclear-armed ballistic missile submarine, and U.S. intelligence officials believe the rogue regime is deliberately “deceiving” Washington -- even as Pyongyang says it seeks peace and denuclearization. South Korea believes the North is working on the submarine on its east coast, Kim Hack-yong, a South Korean lawmaker who was at the helm of the legislature’s defense committee until his term ended a few weeks ago, told The Wall Street Journal on Friday. Kim cited intelligence reports he's viewed to support the claim. Satellite images revealed workers and materials moving at the port of Sinpo, Kim said. The construction is reportedly being done at an indoor facility.
No openly gay man has ever been elected to the Georgia Legislature.	No one was ever arrested for the blaze, although Fieseler writes about how investigators keyed into one main suspect in the fire — a disgruntled bar patron who'd been kicked out earlier in the day and had been heard threatening to burn the place down. It wasn't until 2003 that a plaque commemorating the fire's victims was laid. New Orleans was a conflicted place for the gay community at the time of the fire, Fieseler says. In some ways, the city was a haven for the gay community where people could be themselves. But there were also raids on gay bars, harassment, and discrimination: "An individual who was quiet and who was closeted gay, could find companionship, could find love and joy, could have a job, could have a house, so long as this individual never spoke the dreaded H.
"U.S. Reps. Eric Cantor and Luis Gutierrez were touring the country last year joined at the hip, working together in a bipartisan fashion indeed for the goal of immigration reform."	“We are not going to fight. We are always going to seek for there to be an agreement. … We are going to extend our frank hand to seek a relation of friendship, I repeat, of cooperation with the United States.”
Trump was equally tactful, telling reporters: “I think he’s going to try and help us with the border. “I think the relationship will be a very good one,” the US president said of the Mexican politician, whose swearing-in will be in December. “We talked about trade, we talked about Nafta, we talked about a separate deal, just Mexico and the United States.”
Such restraint contrasted with Trump’s call to López Obrador’s predecessor, weeks after his inauguration last year.
The $5 billion website for Obamacare never worked. Still doesnt work.	The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks picked up 1.1 percent to 1,679.48. Benchmark U.S. crude added 9 cents to $73.03 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract plunged $1.20, or 1.6 percent, to settle at $72.94 per barrel Thursday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 14 cents to $77.25 per barrel in London. It slid 85 cents, or 1.1 percent, to close at $77.39 per barrel on Thursday.
It takes almost a year for a refugee to be processed in the United States.	And in that he is correct. He was also fairly popular as mayor and ended his term with a very respectable approval rating.

"Congressman Ryan has secured a grand total of $116,838,763 to date (for the Mahoning Valley) and has an additional $27,095,000 pending in FY2010 spending bills."	Democratic state Rep.

Freshman Rep. Moira Jayne Walsh, 27, who has been outspoken about what she sees as a culture of corruption in the State House, lost her party's endorsement to Michael Earnheart, who voted for President Donald Trump.
"In North Carolina, they used stimulus money to hire one new state worker. His job, apply for more stimulus funds from the taxpayers by the way of the federal government."	Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
"If Sen. Hillary Clinton could enact all of her campaign proposals, taxpayers would be faced with financing more than $777.6-billion in new spending over one White House term."	The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives. At first there was talk about a much bigger pot of money -- $100 million or more. When the bill was reintroduced this year, the amount was $20 million. By the end of the legislative session, it was down to $5 million.
"Dan Gecker voted to double vehicle registration fees, costing (Chesterfield) county residents over $6 million annually."	They opened “Corruption Park” at a botanical garden in the capital, Kiev. Visitors have explored finery from the depths of Ukrainian greed and graft — a $46,000 crystal falcon, a $300,000 limited edition BMW and a replica of a $9 million chandelier. Which raises the question: Why can’t Illinois have its own Corruption Park? If any locale deserves to display the baubles that come from bribes and other crimes, it’s Illinois, the much-cheated State of Corruption. Envision the park as a perpetual reminder to watch our public officials like a hawk.
"A lot of people don't know that 50,000 Americans now make their living off eBay."	That will allow Trump to argue that his tough approach to trade is paying off. There are reasons why the US economy is currently strong, but none of them have anything to do with tariffs on imports. In part, it is the lagged effect of a buoyant global economy in 2017; in part it is explained by tax cuts and the stimulus still being provided by only gently rising interest rates. Mickey Levy, chief US economist for Berenberg, says Trump’s deregulation agenda has been a factor in boosting America’s underlying growth rate. Evidence from Barack Obama’s presidency shows how protectionist policies can backfire.

80 to 85 percent of my campaign funds go to donations to various organizations throughout the City of Providence.	Hamilton, the Republican state lawmaker who beat the incumbent Karnes, won with a mix of support from teachers and other unions. While Karnes sparred with teachers during the strike, Hamilton took a moderate position. He aligned with teachers unions by opposing state right-to-work legislation and the proposed repeal of prevailing wage laws for public construction projects. The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.
Only 3 percent of voters 18 to 34 dont believe that climate change is really happening.	These numbers are similar to those from a February Quinnipiac poll, where 49 percent of voters said Trump was racist and 46 percent said he was not. Forty-four percent of voters said they think “racist beliefs” were a motive in Trump’s immigration policy, while 50 percent said Trump has “a sincere interest in controlling our borders.” Sixty percent said the policy of separating children from their parents at the border was a violation of human rights. Since enacting the policy, Trump and his associates have repeatedly pushed false, racist narratives to garner support, often associating immigration with high crime rates despite no evidence to support claims that immigrants commit more crime than U.S. citizens. While only 11 percent of Republican voters in the Quinnipiac poll said they think Trump is a racist, 22 percent said they believe Trump has emboldened racist people to express their beliefs publicly. The number of hate crimes rose the year Trump was elected ― the first increase in over a decade.
Says U.S. Senate candidate Joni Ernst does not support a national minimum wage.	About four years ago, Dais had lined up a Chinese company to help develop its business in nanotechnology that helps produce clean water. Tangredi said the Chinese company persuaded a long-time Dais employee to defect with trade secrets. "They just stole it, and they are using it against us," he said. Tangredi said he hopes the threat of a trade war will force China to rethink its practices: "You've got to do something to get their attention."
Birthers have obtained a copy of Obamas Kenyan birth certificate.	He said he supports the project and wants to see it succeed “more than anybody.”
Moore said he knows Obama dating back to the former president’s days as an Illinois state senator running for Congress, driving with him to community meetings and even going as a surrogate for him once or twice.
Keystone means unlocking the Canadian tar sands.	Its Clair Ridge development is expected to come on-stream later this year. Wood Mackenzie says Clair South, with around 300 million barrels of reserves, could be given the $2.2bn investment green light around 2021. So production would peak around 2027. It looks much less attractive to global players.
"The working tax cut created over 40,000 new jobs in just the last four years."	Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) trashed the June jobs report — even though it showed rapid job growth, rising wages, and low unemployment. The report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that employers created 213,000 new jobs in June — 22,000 more than economists had expected. Manufacturing jobs in particular rose by 36,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.

At least 12 people have been killed in a explosion at a fireworks warehouse in Mexico. The casualties are said to include firefighters and rescuers who had arrived at the scene, in the town of Tultepec, to help initial victims. The town, about 32km (20 miles) from Mexico City, is known as the country's pyrotechnic capital. A market in the town has twice been badly damaged by explosions. More than 40 people died in blasts there in 2016.

I get that a lot. Atlanta is supposed to be the place you end up, not the place you begin. Not in some small town, where you would crave but scrape for white boys’ attention because there weren’t many alternatives. And not stuck in your hometown where, God forbid, everyone keeps asking you when you’re going to finally find some fine woman to settle down with and start a family.
It is the Department of Homeland Security's view that returning military veterans and gun owners are likely to commit terrorist acts.	"It's not a unique business," Troia said. "In this case, they just got caught with the door open." Two days after news of that leak broke, a data breach at the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training at Texas State University exposed the personal information of thousands of law enforcement officers. In that case, which was first reported by ZDNet, the personal info was stored on an unsecured web server, a university spokesman told CNNMoney. Data breaches can happen to anyone, of course -- just ask Equifax (EFX), which experienced a hack that exposed the personal information of over 147 million people last fall.
Data on violent crime shows Wisconsin has become less safe than it was when Scott Walker took office.

The Boston Marathon bombing is the fifth case in which U.S. government officials examined individuals potentially involved in terrorism and felt they were no threat and they went on to carry out terrorist murders.	She worried that giving birth to this child would leave her so tainted that no man would ever want her as his wife. In a panic, she told her mother, who swiftly took her to a clinic for an abortion. But A was so frightened by the doctor's description of possible side effects that she thought she would die. And so she retreated to her shelter, where she tried to flatten her growing belly by wrapping it in tight layers of scarves. She hid there for months, emerging only to use the latrine a few meters away.
"In 2006, Donald Trump was hoping for a real estate crash."	In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners. Alas, he is wasting his time trying to shift the views of the Democratic Party, which has become ever more left-wing, if not outright socialist. I think it is time for Mr. James to become a Republican. Guy Randolph
Savannah, Ga.
It’s shocking that Mr. James is surprised by the positive economic results of less regulation and lower taxes.
The Republican leadership's budget proposal doesn't contain any numbers.	Any amount of prescription opioid use was correlated with greater involvement. Among people with prescription opioid use disorder, nearly 20 percent had criminal justice involvement. For heroin users, it was 40 percent. "People who use opioids, including heroin, were up to 13 times more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system," says Winkelman. The study shows the complexity of the the opioid crisis, according to Josiah Rich, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Brown University, who wasn't involved in the research.
Says 1 in 7 American families is on food stamps.	If you look at his high school yearbook, it said he wanted to be a lawyer. But I think he got involved with various movements, and that was more important to him at the time. And then he finally went back to school. GROSS: Was it hard for him to keep the lights on while he was in school? RILEY: I know that we were at various times on food stamps, and yeah.
"The Kenosha casino would be one of the states largest employers and pay more to the state than any other company or Tribe essentially, it would be Wisconsins biggest taxpayer."	Many high-priced commercial parcels were under-assessed, pushing more of the tax burden onto smaller businesses and homeowners, the series concluded. Berrios’ office disputes that there are problems with commercial property assessments, the consultants haven’t been asked to work on the issue, and County Board President Toni Preckwinkle has said it would have to be addressed later. Kaegi, who is poised to take office in early December, said the issue “is something that we’re going to take a very close look at from the outset.” Tax hike coming? The assessor’s office conducts a major reassessment of all properties in the county over a three-year period, dividing up the geography by the north suburbs, south suburbs and the city. This year, the city is under review.
Our race was the closest U.S. Senate race in Ohio in 36 years -- when Howard Metzenbaum defeated Robert Taft in 1976.	"Jon's record is clear—if it's good for Montana, Jon works with anyone from either party to get things done. If it's bad for Montana, he'll stand up to anyone," Tester spokesman Chris Meagher said. "East Coast developer Matt Rosendale is only looking out for himself and whatever out-of-state special interest group that is propping up his campaign with cash. We can't trust him to defend Montana." But before Trump arrived in Montana, Tester's campaign took out full-page ads in newspapers across the state, highlighting bills the senator sponsored that Trump has signed into law.
"We have drawn down to presurge levels. Basra, Mosul and now Sadr City are quiet and it's long and it's tough and there will be setbacks."	"We don't underestimate the impact that the deaths of these young people will be having in the community and we would ask that people focus on supporting each other and supporting the police investigation."

"An amendment to the House health reform bill ""puts new restrictions on women's access to abortion coverage in the private health insurance market even when they would pay premiums with their own money."""	Public support for abortion rights “remains as high as it has been in two decades of polling”, according to Pew Research, with 57% “saying abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 40% say it should be illegal in all or most cases”. “It’s clear that Donald Trump seeks to put forward a narrow-minded elitist who will protect corporations, the wealthy and the powerful, and individuals who will dismantle Roe, take away critical rights of LGBT Americans and eliminate healthcare for millions of people,” said Goldberg, referring to Roe v Wade, the 1973 decision protecting abortion rights. “All of these rights have been hard-won over decades, and it’s no exaggeration to say the right wants to put on the bench an individual that will turn the clock back.”

In rulings on issues such as workplace arbitration, sexual harassment, voting rights, consumer rights and civil rights, the court could have a particuilar impact on society’s most vulnerable. “I think the reality is that the court’s influence on everyday lives is felt most directly by those who tend to depend upon government, those who may not be in a socio-economic position to adequately vindicate their own rights without some government assistance,” said Vladeck.
"As president, Barack Obama has never visited Israel."	“I cannot blame our president for saying that if he was being given wrong information and information meant to hurt and malign people who are doing good,” she said. “If our president would visit us, be with us every day, spend every day with us, he would know the truth.”

Says the private sector in Texas created 1 million jobs over the past decade.

The gain was better than many economists had been expecting and depicts an overall economy that appears to be regaining momentum after a slowdown in the winter.
Pentagon confirms they may court martial soldiers who hold Christian faith.	Bishop John Bauerschmidt, who oversees the Middle Tennessee region of the church, stands firmly by his decision not to authorize their use, nor allow clergy within his diocese to officiate the religious ceremonies or permit the weddings on church property. In doing so, the bishop says he is being faithful to his job of guarding the discipline, faith and unity of the church.

"The teaching that Christian marriage is between a man and a woman is reasonable, traditional, and scriptural," Bauerschmidt said in an email. "There really is nothing remarkable about a Christian bishop who holds to this teaching." While Bishops can place limitations on the use of the marriage liturgies, they must refer couples to a willing diocese if they do not authorize them.
Cobb is one of the largest school systems (in the nation) that is debt free.	Among those reported to be among the top of President Donald Trump’s short list is Judge Brett Kavanaugh on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The prospect of a Justice Kavanaugh worries some consumer advocates, who say he has taken an activist position against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the regulator implemented in the wake of the Great Recession in the hopes of thwarting future financial meltdowns. “Kavanaugh’s track record has shown tremendous sympathy to political rhetoric, more so than to established precedent as it relates to the Bureau,” said Aaron Klein, director of the Center on Regulation and Markets at the Brookings Institution. “His ruling was closer to congressional talking points than legal precedent.”
Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center, said that the center doesn’t weigh in on potential judicial appointees, but that open hostility to the agency’s mission would be cause for concern. “Obviously, it would be concerning if there was a justice that was inclined to invalidate the CFPB,” she said.

An IPO market that was left for dead just two years ago has come roaring back in 2018, with companies raising public capital at a pace rarely seen in the past two decades. So far this year, 120 companies have used initial public offerings to raise $35.2 billion on U.S. exchanges. That is the highest volume since 2012 and the fourth-busiest year-to-date on record, according to Dealogic, whose data go back to 1995.

Did you know that the U.S. is one of the very few nations in the world without an official language?	The report also said that Strzok repeatedly pushed for more aggressive action in the Clinton probe. "The conduct by these employees cast a cloud over the entire FBI investigation and sowed doubt about the FBI’s work," the report concluded. "The damage caused by these employees’ actions extends far beyond the scope of the (Clinton) investigation and goes to the heart of the FBI’s reputation for neutral fact finding and political independence." Goelman, in an op-ed in USA TODAY last month, said Strzok has become the victim of "political gamesmanship" by Congress and President Trump, who has repeatedly tweeted about Strzok as evidence of bias by the FBI and Justice Department. "They have spent months cynically taking these texts out of context and saying that one- or two-word snippets somehow prove that the FBI investigations of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the Russia probe itself, were biased," Goelman wrote.

Illustration: Oliver Osborne for The Wall Street Journal. The U.S. Justice Department, via its civil lawsuits, is attempting to seize almost $2 billion in assets allegedly bought with 1MDB money. However, in August, the department asked a U.S. judge to suspend those cases while it focused on building a criminal investigation into 1MDB, which people familiar with the matter say is focusing on Mr. Low. Mr. Najib launched the 1MDB fund in 2009 as a way to spur investment in Malaysia, but it quickly racked up debts that now stand at $8 billion.

But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.

WASHINGTON – If it's a holiday, it must be time for President Donald Trump to hit the golf course. Right on schedule, the presidential motorcade arrived at the Trump National Golf Club in suburban Virginia in the late morning, the middle of a day that also has the president tweeting and hosting a military-themed picnic later at the White House. As he departed the presidential mansion in the morning, Trump took to Twitter. In addition to a general salutation – "Happy Fourth of July....Our Country is doing GREAT!"

The Labour leader has said the result of the 2016 vote should be respected, but his frontbenchers have been careful not to explicitly rule out a second referendum if the circumstances change. Earlier in the day, Len McCluskey, Unite’s general secretary, said May’s government had lost all authority or capacity to make decisions. “We are not, I repeat for my friends in the media, not, calling for a second referendum … But we remain open to the possibility of a vote on any deal the Tories come back with,” he said. “These people see in Brexit the chance to turn Britain into the low-wage, deregulated, race-to-the-bottom society of their dreams. But Brexit is turning into a nightmare for the rest of us – a nightmare of uncertainty above all.
The fastest-growing part of the Pentagons budget are health care expenses.	It was no surprise to read that the very first lesson you suggest could be learned from overseas (Five things the NHS could do to improve service, 3 July) is the establishment of integrated health and social care, as has happened in New Zealand. The achievements of the Attlee government are at the heart of my socialist beliefs but the compromises which led then to the split between free NHS care and means-tested social care remain the achilles heel as the NHS celebrates 70 years. It is utterly ludicrous to have separate systems which imply distinct and neat boundaries between health and care, with rather a lot of people making a good living arguing on which side of the fence some poor demented soul belongs. Disputes around the funding of continuing care have become a major industry. The recent NHS funding announcement, making no reference whatsoever to social care, evidenced the fact that the government still hasn’t the least idea of how the two are umbilically linked.
"Inflation-adjusted defense spending has declined 21 percent since 2010, and even if we discount the drawdowns in Iraq and Afghanistan, it has still declined by a dangerous 12 percent."	Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. LONDON — Over the past century American and British troops have fought side-by-side in two World Wars, Korea and the conflicts in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan. But some lawmakers and experts in the United Kingdom are warning that the British military could soon be seen as irrelevant by the United States unless it receives a colossal funding boost. "There is a concern that the U.K. is falling ever further behind and becoming even more useless from a U.S. point of view," said Andrew Dorman, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a think tank in London.
"According to ATF data, 70 percent of firearms recovered and traced in drug cartel crimes in Mexico originated from the United States."	Lopez Obrador, 64, would be the first leftist president in decades in Mexico, Latin America’s No. 2 economy, if he ousts the ruling centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Runner-up in the 2006 and 2012 elections, he pitched himself as the only man capable of cleaning up a political class whose credibility has been ground down by graft, years of subpar economic growth and soaring crime levels. Since the race began late last year, at least 133 politicians have been murdered from all the major parties. The crimes are mostly attributed to gangs trying to influence municipal elections.

He then asked to meet in person to discuss another plan he had for an attack in Philadelphia, and the next day, showed the FBI employee a map with landmarks that he considered worthy bombing targets in that city, according to the affidavit. The undercover employee showed Pitts a device the two had discussed previously - a remote control car containing C-4, according to the affidavit. Pitts told the undercover employee the device could be rolled under a police car, or given to the children of military personnel to play with at a parade, "so that the children would unwittingly detonate the bombs," according to the affidavit. A defense attorney for Pitts could not immediately be located. A fireworks display is still planned in Cleveland for July 4, and U.S. Attorney Justice Herdman urged residents not to be deterred from going by someone who "wanted to strike at the values that are at the very core of our nation."

Mazzochi, an attorney, already has name recognition in DuPage County, he said, because of her experience on the College of DuPage Board.

Sen. Hutchison abandoned Republicans and stood with Democrats to ensure health care legislation would pass quickly.	The president told Fox News that he believes his nominee will get some support from Democrats. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, an abortion rights supporter, is considered one of the key votes on a nominee. She said she wouldn't vote for someone who would overturn Roe v. Wade. "A candidate who would overturn Roe would not be acceptable," she said Sunday on ABC's This Week. Collins, who has previously bucked party lines on other key issues such as health care, said she plans to have an in-depth conversation with the nominee.

Only about 100,000 of the United States' 11.1 million immigrants in the country illegally were from Canada, according to the Pew Research Center in 2014. The maritime boat checks come amid some of the most strained relations between the United States and Canada in decades. President Donald Trump's duties on Canadian steel and aluminum, announced in May, were met with in-kind tariffs on billions of dollars worth of American goods. The trade dispute started in earnest after Trump tweeted that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was acting "meek and mild" and was being dishonest about Canada's trade barriers during the Group of 7 summit last month in Charlevoix, Quebec.

That makes sense: It’s a law enforcement agency that leans white and male (72 percent male, 62 percent white), and many federal prisons are in rural parts of the country, which Trump dominated. But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau.

Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, one of the most powerful conservatives in Congress, has denied reports that he ignored the alleged sexual abuse of athletes while he worked as an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University more than 20 years ago. Allegations that Jordan was aware of sexual misconduct and explicitly was informed of specific incidents of alleged assault by the wrestling team's doctor, first surfaced in an NBC news story on Tuesday. But Jordan — who was an assistant coach from 1987 until 1995, when he was elected to the state legislature — has refuted the claims. "Congressman Jordan never saw any abuse, never heard about any abuse, and never had any abuse reported to him during his time as a coach at Ohio State," Ian Fury, Jordan's spokesman, said in a statement. "He has not been contacted by investigators about the matter but will assist them in any way they ask, because if what is alleged is true, the victims deserve a full investigation and justice."Rep.

Unlike most solar farms, Cleve Hill Solar Park’s panels will not all face south, but east and west in a continuous zig-zag. The effect, say the scheme’s opponents, will be to turn green meadows into something resembling a colossal factory roof. Economically and environmentally the scheme makes no sense whatsoever. Apart from ruining a huge swathe of countryside and killing or displacing all the local wildlife, it will do little for Britain’s energy needs.
Says Donald Trump literally has no plans to make higher education more affordable.	It's difficult to imagine Old Hickory, as he was known, excusing himself from military duty on the grounds that he could not march long distances, as Mr Trump did during the Vietnam War, citing bone spurs. The parallels between the 45th president and the 13th - unlucky for some - are arguably more compelling. Fillmore launched his career in the 1820s with the Anti-Masonic Party, hawking a paranoid rumour that ruling Freemasons were murdering whistleblowers. Mr Trump paved the way for his White House bid by peddling a conspiracy theory, too - that President Barack Obama was not a US citizen.

In their statement, Mr Netanyahu and Mr Morawiecki praised the Polish wartime government-in-exile, saying it tried to "raise awareness among Western allies of the systematic murder" of Polish Jews. They also said structures of the Polish underground state supervised by the Polish government-in-exile "created a mechanism of systematic help and support to Jewish people". However Yad Vashem said this contradicted decades of historical research and contained "grave errors and deceptions". It said much of the Polish resistance in its various movements "not only failed to help Jews, but was also not infrequently actively involved in persecuting them". Polish assistance to Jews during the Holocaust was "relatively rare", Yad Vashem said, and "attacks against and even the murder of Jews were widespread".

Franklin Roosevelt (was) the last president to come to the Congress to ask for permission to engage into war.	Teddy Roosevelt hopped on whistle stop tour after whistle stop tour where he was able to drop into rural and suburban communities alike to deliver short, pre-packaged speeches that local papers would usually print verbatim. (He left them short on purpose for that very reason.) Franklin Roosevelt revolutionized and heightened the stature of the office with his fireside chats, that brought his message over the heads of the pesky press corps and directly into the living rooms of the American people.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.

President Trump has just said in the past week he's going to raise things like Syria, like Ukraine, like the election meddling issue, really the whole range of issues between us. And I think that, in the president's mind, this is very important, because it gives him an opportunity to size up Vladimir Putin, to see where there are areas where we might make progress together and where there are areas where we may not.

The Australian “government” connection allowed the bureau to infuse the meaningless Papadopoulos conversation with significance, justifying the probe.

"The failure to hold security forces accountable for such serious human rights violations suggests that the rule of law is virtually absent in Venezuela," UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said on 22 June. Venezuela's foreign ministry rejected the report, calling it the "result of a highly questionable methodology that buries the credibility and technical rigour demanded of an office of this nature".

I lost my health insurance and my doctor because of Obamacare.	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago.

Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”

"(Obamas) entire national security team, including his secretary of state, said we want to arm and train and equip (Syrian rebel forces), and he made the unilateral decision to turn them down."	AMMAN (Reuters) - Syrian rebel negotiators and Russian officers failed on Wednesday to reach an agreement that would end fighting in southern Syria by restoring state sovereignty over remaining opposition held towns, the rebel spokesman said. “The talks with the Russian enemy in Bosra al-Sham have failed because of their insistence on handing over heavy weapons,” Abu Shaima, a spokesman of the central operations room representing main Free Syrian Army factions negotiating with the Russians told Reuters. Accompanied by a major Russian aerial bombing campaign that has led to some of the fastest mass displacements of the war, Syrian pro-government forces have marched swiftly into insurgent territory in Deraa province over the past two weeks. Another rebel spokesman Ibrahim al Jabawi said negotiations failed to reach any conclusion with the Russian side insisting on handing over heavy weapons in one go rather than in stages as the opposition demanded after the return of tens of thousands of displaced Syrians. Rebels had begun a final round of talks on Wednesday where they had prepared a response to a series of demands by Russian officers that included handing over heavy weapons and restoring state sovereignty over towns in Deraa province still in rebel hands.

Tommy Thompson wanted to implant data chips in humans.	The wonders of the ever-growing artificial intelligence industry are real, and if we have the foresight and strength to channel them in the right direction, the benefits will be enormous. But there is a fundamental danger too: the prospect of machines so closely replicating human thinking and behaviour that they provide a huge boost to the kind of desiccated – and fashionable – materialism that would have you believe that thought, consciousness and even emotion are reducible to machine-like processes. Once that school of thought holds sway, the moral questions surrounding robo-care threaten to disappear – for if a machine that happens to be made of flesh and blood is placed in the care of another machine made of casings and processors, what really is the problem? This, I dare say, may eventually turn into one of the most profound questions of our time. I may well be old and infirm by that point, so I’d like to make a pre-emptive appeal to younger readers: bear the likes of me in mind, and think hard.

Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

But Crowley’s most challenging hurdle is a stark reality for all Democrats this cycle: falling voter turnout. A new Pew Research study found that while the youngest generations, including Generation X, Millennials, and the post-Millennial generation, make up of the bulk of eligible voters in 2018, if turnout outcomes from the 2014 midterms persist, they are less inclined to comprise of the majority of voters who cast ballots this November.

Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.

Female prisoners in Victoria are still subject to “abusive” routine strip searches, a state government watchdog says. The Victorian ombudsman, Deborah Glass, said the government has failed to adopt a recommendation from her 2015 report into the prison system that called for an end to the searches. “Why has the government not accepted my recommendation to stop the abusive practice of routinely strip-searching women prisoners – in fact, the only recommendation out of 125 not accepted?” she asked on Wednesday. The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year.

Split those revenues, with 35 percent going to K-12 education, 35 percent to roads, 15 percent to the communities that allow marijuana businesses in their communities and 15 percent to counties where marijuana business are located. Allow communities to decide whether they’ll allow marijuana businesses in their towns.

But 108 years later, the nation’s dense metropolitan areas still depend on railroads to bring millions of suburban commuters to their jobs; Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor line has become profitable and popular; and those twin Hudson tunnels and the swing-span Portal Bridge carry 450 New Jersey Transit and Amtrak trains every day. The problem is, they’re falling apart. The concrete inside the tunnels has been eroding since Superstorm Sandy flooded them with millions of gallons of brackish water in 2012, and the 12,000-volt copper electric cables inside the concrete periodically short-circuit and melt down. “It’s like a volcano erupting,” said Mike Siwiec, an Amtrak electrical specialist who showed me the frayed remains of a cable that ruptured and gridlocked the city in 2015.

These numbers are similar to those from a February Quinnipiac poll, where 49 percent of voters said Trump was racist and 46 percent said he was not. Forty-four percent of voters said they think “racist beliefs” were a motive in Trump’s immigration policy, while 50 percent said Trump has “a sincere interest in controlling our borders.” Sixty percent said the policy of separating children from their parents at the border was a violation of human rights. Since enacting the policy, Trump and his associates have repeatedly pushed false, racist narratives to garner support, often associating immigration with high crime rates despite no evidence to support claims that immigrants commit more crime than U.S. citizens. While only 11 percent of Republican voters in the Quinnipiac poll said they think Trump is a racist, 22 percent said they believe Trump has emboldened racist people to express their beliefs publicly. The number of hate crimes rose the year Trump was elected ― the first increase in over a decade.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.

That said, the nearly 40 million motorists expected to travel this week will pay 11 cents less per gallon at the pump than they did this past Memorial Day holiday, the motorist club noted. "The national gas price average has held fairly steady for the past 10 days, suggesting that U.S. demand is keeping pace with supply and stabilizing summer gas prices," a spokesperson for the motorist group said in a statement.

Says close to 90 percent of the population growth in Texas over the last decade was non-Anglo.	Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.
"A bipartisan background check amendment outlawed any (gun) registry. Plain and simple, right there in the text."	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
Says Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker eliminated cancer screenings for uninsured women and offered no alternatives.	This is just terrible timing all around." Medicaid, an $11 billion, state-federal health plan in Kentucky, covers 1.4 million people, about 600,000 of them children. The federal government provides about 80 percent of the state's Medicaid funds. The cuts to dental and vision benefits were supposed to affect only able-bodied adults, mostly those added to Medicaid under an expansion authorized through the Affordable Care Act.
"Says in regard to providing more tax cuts for the rich, Bill Pascrell said, Republicans had great ideas. I liked some of their ideas."	In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners. Alas, he is wasting his time trying to shift the views of the Democratic Party, which has become ever more left-wing, if not outright socialist. I think it is time for Mr. James to become a Republican. Guy Randolph

It’s shocking that Mr. James is surprised by the positive economic results of less regulation and lower taxes.

"The average student debt coming out of the University of Wisconsin-Madison is something like 28,000 dollars."	Breitbart News reported in April 2017 that the major Missouri institution would close a total of seven residential buildings. “Historically every year between now and August, various situations occur that result in position openings, e.g. normal attrition and voluntary staff choices, as well as unplanned academic or personal challenges,” the university said in a statement. “If necessary, we will offer alternative employment opportunities at comparable compensation to the remaining staff.”
Several years later, the university is still facing a crisis. According to new reports, the University of Missouri is currently facing a $49 million budget shortfall. Additionally, the university has laid off 30 employees and eliminated 155 vacant positions.
Due to a flaw in the 1995 Outer Continental Shelf Deep Water Royalty Relief Act numerous oil companies are now drilling in the Gulf of Mexico in federal lands and paying no royalties to the federal government.	It looks much less attractive to global players. It's for the smaller companies with a focus on exploiting mature reserves. In Aberdeen, Faroe Petroleum might be interested, but its attentions are probably focused on a siege by a Norwegian firm/investor. Ineos might also have an eye to buying, though it just announced its next vast investment plan is for more than £3bn-worth of shale gas cracker plant "on the coast of north-west Europe".
Says Hillary Clinton voted for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs.	In one case, Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion that illegal immigrants do not have the same bargaining rights as American citizens and legal workers. “… an illegal immigrant worker is not an ’employee’ under the NLRA for the simple reason that, ever since 1986, an illegal immigrant worker is not a lawful ’employee’ in the United States,” Kavanaugh wrote. In another case, Kavanaugh noted that American multi-national corporations do not have the right to import foreign workers. The Circuit judge explained, “Under the provision of the immigration laws at issue here, mere economic expediency does not authorize an employer to displace American workers for foreign workers.”
Prominent conservative Ann Coulter has also called for Trump to nominate Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, arguing that other judges such as Thomas Hardiman and Raymond Kethledge “are open borders zealots.”

SAO PAULO (AP) — A Brazilian businessman who amassed and then lost a multi-billion-dollar fortune has been convicted of corruption and sentenced to 30 years in jail.

Nearly 600 more retail jobs are to go in the UK as the Jacques Vert, Windsmoor and Precis department store brands are wound down by administrators. Administrators said they had failed to find a buyer for Calvetron Brands, which had been restructured following a rescue deal last summer. The business entered administration in May and had already shed more than 400 jobs before Wednesday’s announcement. The latest retail job losses come as more than 30,000 jobs are at risk in the UK following mass closure announcements by major chains including House of Fraser, New Look and Marks & Spencer. Retailers are suffering from rising costs and the switch to online shopping just as hard-pressed consumers rein in spending.

"Obama's wife said her goal in life was to put the black community ""first and foremost."""	The list of Democrats expressing frustration with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has been growing longer in recent weeks, but don’t expect to see former President Barack Obama’s name on it. At a party fundraising event Friday afternoon in Northern California, Obama spoke highly of Pelosi – and even predicted that she will return to the job of House speaker after November’s midterm elections. “I think everybody knows how much I love Nancy Pelosi,” Obama told the gathering at a home in affluent Atherton, Politico reported. "Nancy, I believe, is one of the greatest speakers we ever had, and will once again be one of the greatest speakers we ever have after we get through this cycle," he continued. “And there's not much I could have gotten done without having Nancy there alongside of me every step of the way.”

Money towards the Ebola vaccine is basically cut in half to what it was. More cuts are coming under the congressional sequester.	Elections frenzy continues in emerging markets and after Turkey last week, it’s Mexico’s turn on Sunday. Polls predict that former Mexico City mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will be the next president, possibly garnering over half of the votes. This is the third bid for the key job by AMLO as the leftist Lopez Obrador is commonly known; his popularity has grown hand in hand with Mexicans’ anger at the failure of traditional parties to end record levels of violence and corruption. His history of protest politics has unnerved investors though and while throughout this campaign AMLO has courted Wall Street, he has still pledged to review a 2013 opening of the oil industry to private producers. The vote comes at a delicate point for Mexico, which is at odds with the United States over migration and trade, while talks on reworking the NAFTA trade agreement are deadlocked.
"Says state Sen. Randy Hopper, R-Fond du Lac, unlike typical taxpayers, didnt pay taxes"	Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.
"New school testing standards will consume approximately twenty days of testing for elementary, middle and high school students."	Michigan lawmakers axed a requirement that would make prospective teachers take a basic skills test before earning their certification in Michigan. Rick Snyder signed legislation last week to get rid of the law requiring all prospective teachers to take the SAT to become certified in the state of Michigan, the Detroit Free Press reported. “The basic skills test … is not a strong indicator of how successful a teacher will be,” said Sen. Marty Knollenberg (R-Troy), one of the sponsors of the bipartisan-supported legislation. Knollenberg, who serves as the state Senate Education Committee chair, said the panel made its decision to make it easier for people to become teachers.
"Obama voted for ""tax subsidies and giveways"" that have slowed oil companies from pursuing clean energy sources."	— MINING: The EPA said last year that it won't require mining companies to prove they have the financial resources to clean up pollution, an Obama-era rule stemming from a long history of pollution spilling from abandoned mines into streams. Pruitt said modern mining practices and existing regulations made the financial requirement unnecessary and a burden on mining. — AUTOS: Pruitt's EPA has proposed freezing vehicle fuel-efficiency standards at 2020 levels for the next five years, according to a draft of the proposal obtained by Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del. For new vehicles, that means an average of about 30 miles per gallon instead of rising to 36 mpg by 2025 as Obama's EPA proposed. — OIL AND GAS: More than a dozen states are suing the EPA for failing to take action against leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, from oil and natural gas wells.

On Wednesday, Mr McVey said the council had "engaged pretty consistently" with the government, adding: "Fiona Hyslop said any scheme would require engagement with the industry and that's exactly what we're doing. "We have taken a far more robust and professional approach and I've noticed a huge amount of openness to the idea in some quarters that were fairly dismissive of our previous attempts as a local authority." The Scottish Conservatives - who oppose having a tourist tax scheme - said the exchange was "an embarrassing split right at the top of the SNP", with Ms Hyslop "slapping down" Mr McVey "in full public view".

But they split almost down the middle, 42 percent to 39 percent, when asked whether they are proud of America right now. Not surprisingly, the split was along partisan lines: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now.

Prosecutor Autrey James said the two men were convicted "because they acted negligently running that building known as the Ghost Ship." James declined to answer questions outside court, saying the case was still active until the men are formally sentenced in August. Almena's attorney Tony Serra said his client agreed to the plea bargain to alleviate "the pain and suffering of all parties." Serra previously said a plea deal would spare the victims' families from testifying at a trial where photos of burned bodies and other emotionally fraught evidence would be shown.

Victorian government rejects criticism of drug-injecting room saying it is saving lives
The Victorian government has hit back at claims Melbourne’s medically supervised drug-injecting room is a failure, with the centre’s director saying staff intervened during 12 overdoses since it opened less than a week ago. On Friday the shadow attorney general, John Pesutto, criticised the injecting room saying it had not prevented drug use continuing around the centre. Pesutto called for an “independent” analysis, saying he would not take the centre’s staff or the government’s data at “face value”. There were also claims published in the Herald Sun that drug users in the North Richmond area, notorious for heroin use and dealing, were snubbing the centre. However, Dr Nico Clark said on Friday that there had been between one and three overdoses a day that had required staff to provide oxygen or administer the heroin antidote naloxone.

Ukraine voluntarily gave up its nuclear weapons because the United States of America said it would ensure (its) territorial integrity from Russia.	According to a Russian state media report related by Turkey’s Hurriyet Daily News , the United States is planning to send next-generation B61 nuclear gravity bombs to NATO bases in several European countries, including Turkey. The bomb is said to be compatible with F-35 joint strike fighters, which Turkey is also due to receive amid some controversy. Hurriyet describes the B61 nuclear bomb and Russia’s sour reaction to the prospect of NATO bases receiving them:
The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) and the U.S. Air Force completed two non-nuclear system qualification flight tests of the B61-12 gravity bomb on June 9 at Tonopah Test Range in Nevada, according to a June 29 statement by DOE/NNSA. The test, which was reportedly the first of its kind, was aimed at extending the B61 bomb’s service life by adapting it to next generation aircraft, including B-2A Spirit Bomber. “The B61-12 LEP will consolidate and replace the existing B61 bomb variants in the [U.S.] nuclear stockpile.

You've heard endlessly about waterboarding. It happened to three terrorists.	Ethiopia's government has fired five prison officials as it confronts allegations of torture and other abuses of inmates as part of a wave of reforms. Among those fired is the federal prison chief who until recently defended the treatment of inmates as "fair." The firings came ahead of a new Human Rights Watch report released Thursday that documents widespread arbitrary detention, torture, rape and humiliation over several years in Ethiopia's eastern Somali region. It urges new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to investigate the "horrific" situation. Abiy has admitted that security forces have tortured people but has yet to "tackle Ethiopia's culture of impunity and ensure accountability," said Felix Horne, senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch.
"In the past three years, we have prosecuted or brought more cases on access to public records than in the previous 12 years combined."	Practice is only one of Deborah Glass’s 125 recommendations not accepted by Victorian government
Female prisoners in Victoria are still subject to “abusive” routine strip searches, a state government watchdog says. The Victorian ombudsman, Deborah Glass, said the government has failed to adopt a recommendation from her 2015 report into the prison system that called for an end to the searches. “Why has the government not accepted my recommendation to stop the abusive practice of routinely strip-searching women prisoners – in fact, the only recommendation out of 125 not accepted?” she asked on Wednesday. The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year.
"Says nobody in higher education believes Gov. Rick Perrys proposal to serve up $10,000 college degrees is possible."	The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. Teachers are also running a ballot measure campaign that would tax the highest income earners for an additional $690 million to spend on schools. “Regardless of political parties, we need people to make a decision about what’s happening in the classroom,” said Marisol Garcia, vice president of the Arizona Education Association. “To limit ourselves and to say ‘only these people are going to support us’ is just not true.”
Teachers can be at a disadvantage compared to wealthier candidates, who tend to have built-in networks of potential donors.
Crime is down in Arizona.	Thirty-two states with renewable standards didn't have, on average, a correlated rate increase, according to Wesley Hersche, an associate director of research with Arizona State University's Global Security Initiative.

"But renewable energy technologies such as solar, wind, and battery storage have become so cheap recently that this finding is not all that surprising."

But Republican lawmakers dispute arguments suggesting their efforts to undo ObamaCare have been totally fruitless. “We eliminated the individual mandate that said that people had to buy government-approved insurance,” said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo. “In a sense, it blew a big hole in ObamaCare.”
There’s a potential electoral landmine ahead for Republicans hoping to keep their majorities in the House and Senate, though: premium increases. “We’re going to get another round right before the election, which is something the GOP is nervous about,” said John C. Goodman, president of the Goodman Institute.

Eleven employers in Northern Ireland have been fined for failing to pay the National Living and Minimum Wage to their staff. More than £38,000 was owed to 222 employees in Northern Ireland. Roe Park Resort in Limavady in County Londonderry and Dromore Diocesan Trust in County Armagh were among those on the list. It features 239 UK firms in total, which have to pay £1.44m in back-pay and £1.97m in fines for underpayment. The back pay identified by HMRC was for more workers than in any previous single naming list.
The 2013-15 state budget backed by Gov. Scott Walker and Republican lawmakers left our technical colleges funded at 1989 levels.	The University of Missouri is still facing enrollment and budgetary problems, including a $49 million budget shortfall, as a result of the 2015 social justice protests that caught national media attention. Many people remember the high-pitched yell of former University of Missouri professor Melissa Click. Click found herself at the center of weeks of unrest at the University of Missouri in 2015 and 2016. Click rose to infamy after a video of her calling for a student photojournalist to be physically removed from campus simply because he was documenting the protests. The protests involved accusations by students that the administration had mishandled several alleged racial issues on campus.
"The city of Atlanta has one of the highest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender populations per capita, ranking third among major American cities."	“You’re from here?”
I get that a lot. Atlanta is supposed to be the place you end up, not the place you begin. Not in some small town, where you would crave but scrape for white boys’ attention because there weren’t many alternatives. And not stuck in your hometown where, God forbid, everyone keeps asking you when you’re going to finally find some fine woman to settle down with and start a family.
"Says Abraham Lincoln tried to buy slavesfreedom in border states, but the states all rejected it."	On the Fourth of July, 1852, America celebrated its freedom, as it does every Independence Day. Frederick Douglass, America’s most famous anti-slavery activist and fugitive slave, saw no ground to celebrate: he saw the octopus arms of slavery stretched everywhere, exposing the hollowness of America’s freedom values. That holiday, he delivered the greatest antislavery speech in American history. Not least since the racism that made slavery endures.
"You see a whole bunch of Korean cars here in the United States, and you dont see any American cars in Korea."	That may be less true in cases where U.S. companies engage in businesses with a ready substitute. Chinese leader Xi Jinping recently hinted that European and Asian conglomerates might soon find themselves benefiting as China punches back against the U.S.

In turn, that means American firms in China could soon find their new product models at the bottom of the regulatory pile for things like safety approvals, or their state-owned Chinese partners might shift resources toward European joint ventures instead. China has a history of this sort of bureaucratic malfeasance, with its consumers often helping out.
"The ABA's own criteria for a judicial nominee call for, among other things, at least 12 years' experience in the practice of law, and they mean actual practice of law."	She said she believed it would be inappropriate to ask a nominee how they would vote on a future case. But she emphasized that they had to talk about precedent. In her view, Roe v. Wade is settled law, and she wanted someone on the court who would respect precedent. "What I want to see is a nominee who, regardless of his or her personal views on the very difficult and contentious life issue, is going to respect precedent, regardless," she said. "A number of judges (have told me) that good judges are always unhappy with some of their decisions but they make the right call regardless of their personal views.
A 5-cent charge on paper bags is a tax.	'THIS IS YOUR RECEIPT': Jarrod W. Ramos, the man suspected of killing five people during an attack on the Capital Gazette newspaper last week in Annapolis, Maryland, sent multiple threatening letters prior to the shooting, police revealed on Monday ... The paper’s former attorney gave police mail he received at his law office on Monday, the newspaper's former publisher Thomas Marquardt told The Baltimore Sun. One of those documents, dated June 28 – the same day as the shooting – allegedly included a letter from Ramos in which he said he was en route to the paper “with the objective of killing every person present.”
The letter was written in the form of a “Motion for Reconsideration” by a Maryland court following a 2016 refusal to hear Ramos’ defamation case that he had filed against the outlet. That stemmed from a 2011 column published in the paper about a criminal harassment charge against Ramos that was filed by a former high school classmate. “You were too cowardly to confront those lies, and this is your receipt,” he allegedly wrote.
"Obama ""says he'll raise taxes on electricity."""	Nuclear wouldn't count toward the 50 percent mandate, and APS says its Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station is the largest electricity producer in the U.S.
Jeff Burke, APS director of resources planning, says customers would see 6 to 14 percent per year increases on their bills if the company is forced to ratchet up renewable use ahead of schedule. "We continue to add renewables to our system, but they have to make sense," Burke said. "It's not really about a target, it's about what makes sense for our customers' usage and what makes rates affordable and what keeps our system reliable." Thirty-two states with renewable standards didn't have, on average, a correlated rate increase, according to Wesley Hersche, an associate director of research with Arizona State University's Global Security Initiative. "These issues involve a complex interaction of factors, and we should be careful not to oversimplify things," Hersche wrote in April.
Says U.N. arms treaty will mandate a new international gun registry.	Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Turns 50
The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was presented for signatures 50 years ago today. NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Lawrence Weiler, one of the U.S. negotiators of the treaty. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
It's been weeks since President Trump declared talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a great success. But today, the Washington Post is reporting that U.S. intelligence officials have concluded North Korea does not intend to fully surrender its nuclear stockpile. We thought this would be a good moment to check in with someone who spent decades working on arms reduction and denuclearization treaties.
Says Rick Scott didnt even come to his own education summit. But he did take time to go to the tea party convention the same week.	Hamilton, the Republican state lawmaker who beat the incumbent Karnes, won with a mix of support from teachers and other unions. While Karnes sparred with teachers during the strike, Hamilton took a moderate position. He aligned with teachers unions by opposing state right-to-work legislation and the proposed repeal of prevailing wage laws for public construction projects. The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.
Florida has the third most-regressive tax structure.	Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.
Eleven states have enacted these pay-to-play reforms.	"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.

For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.
"With the tax controls we already put in place, property taxes on a typical home in December of 2014 will actually be lower than they were in December of 2010."

The 9-9-9 plan does not raise taxes on those that are making the least.	The latest high-level departure from President Donald Trump's Cabinet was not the most unexpected departure that has faced the administration. Scott Pruitt, the administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency, came under fire multiple times during his tenure over questionable finances, including both excessive spending and sweetheart deals that helped him spend less than expected. Here's a review of his time in office. Dec. 7, 2016: Trump announces that Pruitt will be his nominee for EPA administrator
The then-Attorney General of Oklahoma was touted by Trump as having "great qualifications and a good record." Part of that record was Pruitt touting himself as a "leading advocate against the EPA's activist agenda," and his history of challenging the EPA was well known.
I did not support the sequester.	Daniel Egan tells inquiry that it was obvious everybody needed to get out, not stay put
The inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire has heard that a senior firefighter who arrived at the blaze just before 2am thought the residents should have been evacuated long before they were. During testimonies that made clear a lack of communication between firefighters, the inquiry heard how Daniel Egan, a senior fire safety officer with the London fire brigade arrived at the fire at 1.58am and immediately thought “we need to get people out of the building.”
“It looked like a film, people were shouting and screaming, they were panicking and wanting people to help,” he said. “My first thoughts were that we needed to get everybody out. I could hear the roar of the tower. It was obvious … you could hear people screaming … it was just so obvious, sorry.”
The “stay put” policy wasn’t abandoned until 2.47am, after which residents calling 999 who had been told to stay in their flats were told to try and evacuate.

Says Jeff Wentworth was the only Republican to vote against the Texas measure requiring women to have a sonogram before receiving an abortion.	The strategy reprises last year's successful approach to confirming Justice Neil Gorsuch in the early spring of 2017. Gorsuch was named to fill the vacancy left by the death of Antonin Scalia and then kept open by the refusal of the Senate's Republican majority to consider Merrick Garland, the replacement named by President Barack Obama in 2016. Gorsuch was greeted with delight by abortion opponents, even though he had not ruled directly on Roe in his judicial career. But his confirmation was far from a sure thing because two Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, were seen as defenders of abortion rights.

It started with a tweet from South Carolina's Department of Agriculture — an account off to a feisty start since it was created in June.

Says New Jersey has the most educated population of all the states in this country.	There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void. In New Jersey, this is compounded by the fact that the state is located between two big cities, New York and Philadelphia, that are in other states. The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.
"The Wisconsin law repealed by Republicans, which allowed discriminated workers to sue in state court, was kind of a gravy train for lawyers."	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”

Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.
Says Obama opposes offshore drilling and a gas tax holiday.	— MINING: The EPA said last year that it won't require mining companies to prove they have the financial resources to clean up pollution, an Obama-era rule stemming from a long history of pollution spilling from abandoned mines into streams.

Tom Carper, D-Del. For new vehicles, that means an average of about 30 miles per gallon instead of rising to 36 mpg by 2025 as Obama's EPA proposed. — OIL AND GAS: More than a dozen states are suing the EPA for failing to take action against leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, from oil and natural gas wells.

Says a federal judge sanctions Tennessee birther lawyer for bringing a frivolous lawsuit.	A judge ordered federal emergency officials to extend vouchers for temporary hotel housing for nearly 1,700 Puerto Rican hurricane evacuees, saying ending the program could cause irreparable harm. Saturday night's decision came shortly after civil rights group LatinoJustice PRLDEF filed a lawsuit seeking relief for the Puerto Ricans, whose federal housing assistance vouchers were set to expire at midnight Sunday, meaning the evacuees could have been evicted from the hotels.

"Food stamp spending doubled under President Bush, doubled again under President Obama."	The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) spent a total of $4 billion on improper food stamp payments to those receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the USDA confirmed with Breitbart News on Friday. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service announced this week that improper payments made up 6.3 percent of SNAP money in the fiscal year (FY) 2017—the latest data available from the agency. Breitbart News analyzed the USDA’s data on food stamp spending and found that $4,007,026,532 of the $63,603,595,754 the agency spent on SNAP in FY 2017 went to improper payments. The USDA told Breitbart News that “it is important to note that improper payments include both overpayments and underpayments,” meaning that households on SNAP that received less than what they were supposed to receive for the month are also included in the percentage rate. Brandon Lipps, the Acting Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services at the agency, said that most improper payments are due to “human errors”—either because of state agencies miscalculating benefits or benefit recipients giving state agencies the wrong information.The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) spent a total of $4 billion on improper food stamp payments to those receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the USDA confirmed with Breitbart News on Friday.

"But when I pointed out to Cohen that he wasn’t repeating past vows to 'take a bullet' and 'do anything' to protect the president, the longtime Trump loyalist left little doubt about where he stands now, saying simply: 'To be crystal clear, my wife, my daughter and my son, and this country have my first loyalty.'

They are even now talking about two other former Kennedy clerks for the Supreme Court, Judges Brett Kavanaugh and Ray Kethledge. And they've put a bunch of Kennedy clerks onto the lower courts. And they seem to exploit some connections between the Kennedy and Trump families. Justice Kennedy's son, Justin, had business dealings with President Trump. Ivanka Trump visited the Supreme Court at Justice Kennedy's invitation after the two of them met after the inauguration.

Most tips left at Dunkin Donuts dont go to employees.	(Reuters) - A man went on a stabbing spree at a 3-year-old’s birthday party at an apartment complex housing refugee families in Boise on Saturday, injuring nine people, including six children, police said on Sunday. Timmy Kinner, a 30-year-old from Los Angeles who had been staying at the complex, has been arrested, Boise police said. He is not an immigrant and went on the rampage a day after being asked to leave by one of the residents, police said. Kinner was being held without bail at the Ada County jail on 15 charges, including six of injury to a child and nine of aggravated battery, jail records showed. There was no lawyer listed for Kinner in the records.

The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.

U.S. Government lawyers are slamming one of President Donald Trump's most prominent critics, attorney Michael Avenatti, over nearly half a million dollars in unpaid federal taxes owed by his former firm. Avenatti's former law firm, Eagan Avenatti LLP, agreed to make the roughly $452,000 tax payment last month in order to resolve a bankruptcy case, but the funds never arrived at the IRS, according to a filing Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, Calif.

"Four balanced budgets in a row, with no new taxes for anyone. The best job growth in 12 years. Nearly 130,000 new private-sector jobs. Merit pay to reward New Jerseys best teachers, and the most education funding ever."	Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.

"Taxpayer-funded benefits to illegals in California are ""a skyrocketing cost under Obamacare."""	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
"Should Democrats get their way, every income tax bracket will increase on Jan. 1, 2011. Every single one."	The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.

Germany remains haunted by the Nazis' mass murder of Jews in 1933-1945. Ms Giffey, a centre-left Social Democrat (SPD) politician, said teachers needed more support to combat anti-Semitism, as the problem went beyond the classroom, involving parents and society at large. "So in the coming school year, as a first step, we will send 170 anti-bullying experts into selected schools in Germany, funded by the federal authorities," she told the daily Rheinische Post.

Blocking a U.S. Supreme Court nomination during the remaining months of President Obamas term would leave the nations highest court with an unprecedented year-long vacancy.	The strategy reprises last year's successful approach to confirming Justice Neil Gorsuch in the early spring of 2017. Gorsuch was named to fill the vacancy left by the death of Antonin Scalia and then kept open by the refusal of the Senate's Republican majority to consider Merrick Garland, the replacement named by President Barack Obama in 2016. Gorsuch was greeted with delight by abortion opponents, even though he had not ruled directly on Roe in his judicial career. But his confirmation was far from a sure thing because two Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, were seen as defenders of abortion rights.

North Korea is believed to be constructing an operational nuclear-armed ballistic missile submarine, and U.S. intelligence officials believe the rogue regime is deliberately “deceiving” Washington -- even as Pyongyang says it seeks peace and denuclearization.

Kim cited intelligence reports he's viewed to support the claim. Satellite images revealed workers and materials moving at the port of Sinpo, Kim said. The construction is reportedly being done at an indoor facility.

Says Romney had the uniforms for the 2002 Winter Olympic games made in Burma.	Elections frenzy continues in emerging markets and after Turkey last week, it’s Mexico’s turn on Sunday. Polls predict that former Mexico City mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will be the next president, possibly garnering over half of the votes. This is the third bid for the key job by AMLO as the leftist Lopez Obrador is commonly known; his popularity has grown hand in hand with Mexicans’ anger at the failure of traditional parties to end record levels of violence and corruption. His history of protest politics has unnerved investors though and while throughout this campaign AMLO has courted Wall Street, he has still pledged to review a 2013 opening of the oil industry to private producers. The vote comes at a delicate point for Mexico, which is at odds with the United States over migration and trade, while talks on reworking the NAFTA trade agreement are deadlocked.

Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.

Says CNN deleted an online poll showing Bernie Sanders won the first Democratic presidential debate to help out Hillary Clinton.	Goelman, in an op-ed in USA TODAY last month, said Strzok has become the victim of "political gamesmanship" by Congress and President Trump, who has repeatedly tweeted about Strzok as evidence of bias by the FBI and Justice Department. "They have spent months cynically taking these texts out of context and saying that one- or two-word snippets somehow prove that the FBI investigations of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the Russia probe itself, were biased," Goelman wrote. "Despite the obvious partisan gamesmanship going on, the reality is that Pete did nothing more than express his personal opinions in private conversations with a friend and colleague," the attorney said. "And what his attackers fail to ever mention is that, among the many other texts, Pete criticizes a range of both Democratic and Republican figures, including Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and (former Attorney General) Loretta Lynch."

Congress is a very special group of people. More than 80 percent of them never left the United States.	Corporate America couldn’t hire Republican lobbyists fast enough after President Donald Trump’s election gave the GOP unified control of Washington.

Companies and trade groups are trying to hire congressional staffers with ties to influential House Democrats four months ahead of the midterm elections, in which Democrats are expected to pick up seats and potentially retake control of the House. Lobbyists are helping their clients meet with the Democrats who would become committee chairs if the party does win back the chamber.

The current tax splash is its last throw of the dice, a direct pitch for people who have lost faith in government to take the money instead. It sends the subtle message that the economy is travelling well and there’s money to spare. But it’s the inability of a decentralised wages system to share the growth, and the overreach in destroying Australia’s progressive tax system, that remains the ultimate hand-brake for these cuts to be the path to redemption for the government.

The USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll of 1,004 adults, taken online June 26-27, has a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The survey is one of a year-long series on American values.
On running for re-election to U.S. Senate	That's more than all but three Democratic senators (Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana), all of whom are from red states and facing re-election this fall. "I think he's terrific," Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., who also faces a tough re-election fight, said in an interview. "It's harder work when you're not interested in voting the party line. You've got to look at every issue from all sides." "I really have been pleasantly surprised how willing he is to tell Chuck Schumer to go fly a kite," she added, referring to the Senate minority leader.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.

"Independent analysts found that Trumps tax plan, given to the wealthy and big corporations, would rack up $30 trillion in debt."	In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners. Alas, he is wasting his time trying to shift the views of the Democratic Party, which has become ever more left-wing, if not outright socialist. I think it is time for Mr. James to become a Republican. Guy Randolph

It’s shocking that Mr. James is surprised by the positive economic results of less regulation and lower taxes.
Overdosing is now the number one accidental killer in our Commonwealth.	Emergency officials found a man and a woman — both aged in their 40s — unconscious at a property in Amesbury, England, on Saturday. “It was initially believed that the two patients fell ill after using possibly heroin or crack cocaine from a contaminated batch of drugs,” Wiltshire Police said in a statement. “However, further testing is now ongoing to establish the substance which led to these patients becoming ill and we are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances surrounding this incident.”
Public Health England's @PHE_uk advice is currently: "Based upon the number of casualties affected, is that it is not believed that there is a significant health risk to the wider public. This will be continually assessed as further information becomes known." — Wiltshire Police (@wiltshirepolice) July 4, 2018
The force added that the pair "might have been exposed to an unknown substance."
Toledo Mayor Mike Bell (once) lost his job as a firefighter because his city ran out of money.	He had a small team of allies and has built his political life with them. The big exception was during this election he realized astutely that no one can win by himself. He has built a large coalition that includes a far-right party completely opposed to progressive politics. He has done so because he needed them to win. How will he behave toward those members of his very odd coalition is anyone’s guess.
"In South Carolina, women earn 76 cents on the dollar to mens earnings."	Peach Wars: Southern States Spar Over Which Has The Most Juice
It's a juicy rivalry complete with peach emoji and a well-timed "bless your heart." The agriculture departments in Georgia and South Carolina sparred on Twitter this week over which of them really deserves the title of Peach State. It started with a tweet from South Carolina's Department of Agriculture — an account off to a feisty start since it was created in June. The department claimed that South Carolina harvests three times more peaches than Georgia does.

Says the Panhandle has had its highest-ever bed tax collections in 2011.	Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.
Says MAX carries 30 percent of evening rush-hour commuters traveling from Downtown on the Sunset and Banfield freeways.	Lyft, like Uber, is moving beyond cars. The ride-hailing startup on Monday announced it will acquire Motivate, the largest bikeshare operator in North America. Motivate operates Citi Bike in New York and Capital Bikeshare in Washington DC, among other brands. The move comes as Lyft has been expanding its reach in the transportation space. It has integrated public transit in its app and introduced Lyft Line, which lets users share a ride with strangers who are going to destinations close together.

In addition to the 13 people who were killed, more than 1,000 others were sickened when plastic bags containing the poison were leaked on five subway lines on March 20, 1995. At least 4,000 more turned up at hospitals for treatment of anxiety and trauma reactions.
Theres no negative advertising in my campaign at all.	“The consensus is you are giving up a lot of control,” she said. That sentiment is growing in the advertising industry.

"The question I always ask my clients is, 'What keeps you awake at night?'"
Mark Kirk: Lied about going to war. Opposed middle class tax cuts. And said unemployments not that big an issue.	Trump motioned to news media covering the Great Falls rally and said 75 percent "of those people are downright dishonest." His barbs against the media came on a day when newsrooms across the U.S. held a moment of silence in remembrance of five Maryland newspaper staffers who were fatally shot last week by a man who authorities say held a grudge against the publication. In a campaign stop that was both political and personal, Trump targeted Tester in a bid to get more Republicans elected to the Senate but also to punish the lawmaker he blames for derailing his nominee to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. Appearing in a state he dominated in 2016, Trump cast Tester as a "liberal Democrat," railing against his voting record on issues like abortion, immigration and taxes. While Tester opposed Trump's first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, and the Republican tax bill, he also took flak from the left for a bill easing the rules on banks.

Trump’s reckless comments about Maxine Waters
If the unthinkable were to happen and Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., were injured in any way by an assailant, the situation must be squarely laid at the feet of the president of the United States. There isn’t much ambiguity about this, anyone can connect the dots. More: Democrats took the bait from Donald Trump, it's not a winning strategy at the polls
President Donald Trump is playing with fire by calling Waters “crazy” and accusing her of corruption. The potential awful effects, which he can neither foresee nor control, are dangerous. Trump is playing with people’s lives.
To deprive underprivileged children of a meat-based protein during school lunch is most likely depriving them of their only source of protein for the day.	They are to consult on detailed plans to restrict the promotion and marketing of foods high in salt, sugar and fat. This would target confectionary, biscuits, crisps, cakes, pastries, sugary soft drinks and potentially ice creams, and include restrictions on multi-buy offers, meal deals, unlimited refill deals and where products can be displayed in shops. Newly appointed public health minister Joe Fitzpatrick said "far too many people" were facing "serious risks to their health" which were "largely avoidable". 'Profound impact'
The new government report states that "the Scottish diet remains stubbornly unhealthy", with the country "far from meeting our dietary goals" - something which has a "profound" impact on health and lifestyle. Problems start early, with the report setting out "alarming" findings on the number of children consuming food and drinks high in fat or sugar - studies suggest 29% of children are at risk of being overweight, half of whom are at risk of obesity.
"Says Allen West helped thwart a terrorist plot by shooting a gun in the direction of an Iraqi detainee, then reported the incident to his superior and said it was wrong."	President Donald Trump is not responsible for the killing of journalists in Annapolis last week. His belittling of the press — his “enemy of the American people” taunts, his promises to roll back libel laws, his fomenting rage toward specific journalists at rallies — is worth mentioning within the context of the murders, because it speaks to a larger concern that last Thursday’s attack on The Capital Gazette won’t be an isolated incident. Journalists, many of whom already risk their lives covering war and violence, many of whom receive death threats regularly, feel understandable jitters about a leader who tries to turn the American public against us, particularly when we watch a member of that public shoot up a newsroom and end five lives. It’s reckless and inaccurate, though, to pin the shootings on Trump. The suspect swore an oath to kill a Capital writer who wrote about him in 2011.
"The Dog Meat Festival in Yulin, China, threatens global public health."	“Some of these articles feature exaggerations or overgeneraliszations [sic]; for example, some claim that China is ‘world No.1’ in certain field.”
The problem with these pieces, the People’s Daily argued in this column, is that “they lack basic facts and deep thought.”
Should Xi implement this reform in the tone of Chinese state media, it would mean a significant change for the typical styles of the nation’s largest publications. In 2017 alone, Chinese state publications proclaimed that the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse scandal proves that “Chinese traditional values” are superior to Western ones; the Soviet Union failed because it lacked “Chinese culture”; and that the West was doomed to fail because Western leaders “always believe in absolute conquest.”
An extensive profile of Xi Jinping in the state outlet Xinhua last year also went out of its way to proclaim that the world is riveted by Xi and his ability to “make things happen,” as evidenced by the “numerous clicks and many thumbs-up on the Internet” his speeches and political commentary garner. The story featured an anecdote about a man who drank some of the ink he was using to translate the Communist Manifesto because “the taste of truth is so sweet.”
Not to be left behind, in December, the People’s Daily proclaimed, “A unique path, a unique theory, a unique system, a unique culture; Xi Jinping’s thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era has developed a rich path for China that has transcended Western-centric theory.”
The growing human rights movement within China has also become one of the most common targets of vitriol for state media. Shortly following the death of Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo last year, the Global Times called Liu and his supporters “losers” and dismissed their lives as a “waste.”
The People’s Daily message this week may be aimed for North Korea as much as it is for China, as Pyongyang prepares for what appears to be inevitable economic profit following dictator Kim Jong-un’s in-person meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. North Korean state media are more vitriolic and exaggerated than their Chinese counterpart, spending much of 2017 threatening a nuclear attack on the United States and sentencing Trump to death.

Durbin’s advocacy for mass-migration and for younger ‘dreamer’ illegals has caused the Democrats much political pain. He pushed for the abortive budget-shutdown in January 2018, and for the “Gang of Eight” amnesty bill in 2013 which helped the Democrats lose nine seats in 2014. The Democrats’ top leader in the Senate, Sen. Chuck Schumer, is keeping his distance from the “Abolish ICE” campaign. He is instead using his Twitter account to tout Democrats’ promises on healthcare, guns, gay status, and claims that President Donald Trump is tied to Russian President Vladimir Putin. On the Abolish ICE campaign, Schumer is instead calling for a “czar” to focus media attention on “reunifying families.” That topic polls better for Democrats than ending immigration enforcement.
Finance experts estimate that paying in cash for the $2.5 billion in projects funded by the sales tax saved Gwinnett County more than $1 billion in interest payments.	They include the United States withdrawing its 28,500 troops in South Korea, ending its military drills with South Korea and stop bringing in strategic assets such as aircraft carriers and nuclear-capable bombers. North Korea hasn't repeated such specific demands since entering disarmament talks earlier this year, raising optimism that the country truly appeared to seek to improve ties with the United States. After the summit, Trump suspended annual military training with South Korea that the North has called an invasion rehearsal. But North Korea still prefers a step-by-step disarmament process with reciprocal concessions and benefits from the United States for each of the North's denuclearization steps. The ultimate rewards North Korea wants range from the easing or lifting of American-led international sanctions, the signing of a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, the establishment of diplomatic ties and the pulling out of U.S. troops in South Korea, experts say.

Says Milwaukee County district attorney candidate Verona Swanigan has worked as a prosecutor.	“I think he’s absolutely brilliant, with the right temperament,” McConnell told reporters over the weekend. But that political endorsement is backed up by many in the legal community who rave about Thapar. Louisville attorney Ned Pillersdorf, who calls himself a “Bernie Sanders Democrat,” told the Louisville Courier-Journal that Thapar is fair and judicial. “There are much, much worse Trump nominees they should go after...If I get to talk to Bernie, I’d say vote for him.” Thapar has shown he can be tough on both defendants and the government. He once sentenced a woman to 18 years in prison for assisting her jailed daughter to obtain drugs that killed her.
Georgia has saved $20 million through changes in criminal sentencing.	The proposal would:
Legalize the possession and sale of up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana for personal, recreational use for people over the age of 21. A person could keep up to 10 ounces of marijuana at home. Tax marijuana sales with a 10 percent excise tax at the retail level as well as the state's 6 percent sales tax. Split those revenues, with 35 percent going to K-12 education, 35 percent to roads, 15 percent to the communities that allow marijuana businesses in their communities and 15 percent to counties where marijuana business are located. Allow communities to decide whether they’ll allow marijuana businesses in their towns.
About two-thirds of all consumption is services. . . It was just the opposite when the sales tax was enacted in the 30s.	The services sector, where most Americans are employed, has now expanded for 101 consecutive months, or more than eight years. The gain was better than many economists had been expecting and depicts an overall economy that appears to be regaining momentum after a slowdown in the winter.

He drove a taxi to get through law school, and his degrees from Notre Dame and Georgetown give him a non-Ivy League appeal. Minuses: His star appears to be fading. A limited paper trail on the appeals court worries some conservatives. He is not known as a great legal theorist like Kavanaugh, nor is he a "feeder judge" whose law clerks are snapped up by Supreme Court justices.

The Ryan budget gets rid of Medicare in 10 years and turns it into a voucher program.	"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.
On assault weapon violence: Ducks have more protection than people in Virginia.	On this much police and activist South Side priest Michael Pfleger can agree: Saturday morning’s anti-violence march on the Dan Ryan Expressway is all about danger. Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.
The increase in the garbage tax that [Mayor Allan Fung] imposed in Cranston for some people has been as much as $200.

Scott Pruitt is out but his impact on the environment will be felt for years
Scott Pruitt, who has finally stepped down as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency after a long-rumbling corruption scandal, rose to public prominence on the back of a series of increasingly outlandish ethical controversies. Scott Pruitt resigns: Trump's scandal-ridden EPA chief steps down Read more
From lobbying fast food company Chick-fil-A on behalf of his wife, to demanding his staff acquire a mattress from a Trump Hotel – not to mention the millions of taxpayer dollars spent on security, first-class travel and soundproof booths – Pruitt’s behavior clashed spectacularly with any pretense of Trump’s pledge to “drain the swamp” in Washington. But the lasting legacy of the former Oklahoma attorney general – who was picked by Trump after crusading against what he called the EPA’s “activist agenda” – is likely to be felt in the systematic weakening of environmental regulations. While not as eye-catching as, for example, his demand that his official vehicle use sirens so he could reach a French restaurant on time, Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left behind a demoralized agency where staff fret that their ability to protect public health has been diminished. A staunch ally of oil and gas companies, Pruitt stacked EPA advisory boards with industry representatives and sought to set aside whole troves of research that link pollution to various illnesses.

Says Hillary Clinton wants to let people just pour in. You could have 650 million people pour in and we do nothing about it. Think of it. Thats what could happen. You triple the size of our country in one week.	Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.

If anything, he’s just spray painted an old, rusty wagon wheel with the glitzy gold that, over the decades, he’s made synonymous with his own family name. But this era of bright screens and on-demand delivery seems to be clouding our minds, as though we’ve purposefully trained ourselves to focus on the shiny spray painted object in front of us and not on the more important stories unfolding just off our phone screens. While the founders envisioned a government that moved slowly and methodically, today’s Wi-Fi-enabled political discourse is demanding the opposite, and the allure of being one day’s internet sensation has drawn most all of us in like moths to a flame named Trump — the one steady, bright light that we all shamelessly, even helplessly, flitter towards even as we should know the momentary warmth is hiding the heat that will eventually be our own doom. Trump’s chaos theory of running companies is now on full display in the West Wing, but it’s also on display in the rest of us. He’s the made himself the center of our universe, and most of us are now unwittingly circling his orbit.

Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.

"The lawyer who brought the case against NationsBank said publicly that Alex Sink had nothing to do with the case, had nothing to do with the situation and didnt know about the problems."	This animation shows how money allegedly misappropriated from 1MDB moved through global wealth centers before being used to buy real estate, art, and other assets around the world, including in New York and Beverley Hills. Illustration: Oliver Osborne for The Wall Street Journal. The U.S. Justice Department, via its civil lawsuits, is attempting to seize almost $2 billion in assets allegedly bought with 1MDB money. However, in August, the department asked a U.S. judge to suspend those cases while it focused on building a criminal investigation into 1MDB, which people familiar with the matter say is focusing on Mr. Low. Mr. Najib launched the 1MDB fund in 2009 as a way to spur investment in Malaysia, but it quickly racked up debts that now stand at $8 billion.
"Were spending millions for each individual held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba."	Crimes such as robbery remain rampant across Venezuela amid the country’s dire economic and humanitarian crisis, leading growing numbers of people to turn to violence merely to ensure survival. Kidnappings, armed robberies, and violent attacks are now commonplace. Venezuela is widely considered one of the most dangerous destinations in the world. As noted by El Nacional, “There are many travelers who have been stripped of money, luggage, and vehicles on the Caracas-La Guaira highway, especially at night and early morning when the road is little traveled and lacks surveillance.”
The doctors were present in Venezuela as part of an agreement between the two countries. Venezuela typically pays for the doctors in vast quantities of oil, an initiative that started under Hugo Chávez and Fidel Castro.
Texas is LAST (50th) in spending for mental health care.	Disputes around the funding of continuing care have become a major industry. The recent NHS funding announcement, making no reference whatsoever to social care, evidenced the fact that the government still hasn’t the least idea of how the two are umbilically linked. From as far back as 1998 to as recently as last month, the health select committee has argued for properly joined-up provision.

Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.

NEW YORK — House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) has referred 15 individuals, including longtime Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal, for possible “open setting” testimony in the ongoing Russia investigation. The list was sent to House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA). Many of the names are tied to the discredited anti-Trump dossier produced by the controversial Fusion GPS firm, which was paid for its dossier work by both Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) via the Perkins Coie lawfirm. Indeed, Perkins Coie attorney Marc E. Elias, who reportedly was involved in arranging the payments that resulted in the dossier, made the Nunes list. As did Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson.
Barack Obama won't even use the term 'war on terrorism.'	The strategy reprises last year's successful approach to confirming Justice Neil Gorsuch in the early spring of 2017. Gorsuch was named to fill the vacancy left by the death of Antonin Scalia and then kept open by the refusal of the Senate's Republican majority to consider Merrick Garland, the replacement named by President Barack Obama in 2016. Gorsuch was greeted with delight by abortion opponents, even though he had not ruled directly on Roe in his judicial career. But his confirmation was far from a sure thing because two Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, were seen as defenders of abortion rights.

That makes sense: It’s a law enforcement agency that leans white and male (72 percent male, 62 percent white), and many federal prisons are in rural parts of the country, which Trump dominated. But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau. BOP has long suffered the kind of problems you’d expect for a massive bureaucracy centered on caging tens of thousands of people.

Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.

In that case, which was first reported by ZDNet, the personal info was stored on an unsecured web server, a university spokesman told CNNMoney. Data breaches can happen to anyone, of course -- just ask Equifax (EFX), which experienced a hack that exposed the personal information of over 147 million people last fall.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is heading back to North Korea on Thursday to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and other senior officials. His mission: to flesh out the details of a vaguely worded joint declaration that Kim signed with President Trump in Singapore last month. In that document, the U.S. pledges security guarantees for North Korea, while North Korea commits to "work toward a complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula." There are doubts, though, about how serious Pyongyang is about doing that. After announcing Pompeo's trip to Pyongyang on Monday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders got a barrage of questions about reports that North Korea is expanding sites tied to its nuclear weapons program and that U.S. intelligence officials don't think Kim intends to relinquish his nuclear arsenal.

One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. Teachers are also running a ballot measure campaign that would tax the highest income earners for an additional $690 million to spend on schools. “Regardless of political parties, we need people to make a decision about what’s happening in the classroom,” said Marisol Garcia, vice president of the Arizona Education Association. “To limit ourselves and to say ‘only these people are going to support us’ is just not true.”

Families old and young joined together to show their strength at the Round Lake Beach Families Belong Together rally Sunday afternoon. The rally at Round Lake Beach was part of a larger event held in all 50 states over the weekend, including Saturday’s rally in Highland Park, that centered on denouncing President Donald Trump and his administration's controversial immigration policy that has separated children from their parents. “He definitely needs to be held accountable for what he’s done,” said Round Lake Beach Families Belong Together organizer Jill Birdwell. Trump has since signed an executive order to block the separation of undocumented families attempting to enter the country, but Birdwell believes that’s not enough to undo damage the policy has caused. “There’s no guarantee that they'll go back with their parents again, and beside all the torture they've gone though, they are going to need a lot of help and support and psychological help and emotional help through all this,” Birdwell said.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

But after maintaining months of silence as to what it has endured, or what exactly the military's complaints are, Dawn recently published a frank and stinging editorial. The editorial describes its important, factual reporting about the serious rift between civil and military authorities during the Nawaz Sharif government, which had infuriated the military, and Dawn's insistence on protecting the sources for its stories - a basic element of media ethics worldwide. The editorial states that "a campaign of disinformation, libel and slander, hate and virtual incitement to violence against Dawn and its staff has necessitated placing certain matters on record". It added that elements "within or sections of the state" are not upholding constitutional freedoms.
Children who witness domestic violence are twice as likely to commit it themselves.	Practice is only one of Deborah Glass’s 125 recommendations not accepted by Victorian government
Female prisoners in Victoria are still subject to “abusive” routine strip searches, a state government watchdog says. The Victorian ombudsman, Deborah Glass, said the government has failed to adopt a recommendation from her 2015 report into the prison system that called for an end to the searches. “Why has the government not accepted my recommendation to stop the abusive practice of routinely strip-searching women prisoners – in fact, the only recommendation out of 125 not accepted?” she asked on Wednesday. The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year.
On reauthorization of Export-Import Bank.	Federal Reserve officials last month said they expect to keep raising interest rates and suggested that by the next year, they could be high enough that they could start slowing growth, according to minutes of their discussion released Thursday. While noting a strong economy, Fed officials appeared vigilant about emerging risks, especially trade tensions, and the dangers of an economy that might overheat. The officials noted heightened concerns from businesses about President Donald Trump's get-tough trade policies and that some executives had already scaled back future spending plans because of the uncertainty. They also said they were monitoring changes in market-set interest rates. A narrowing in the gap between short-term and long-term rates has been an accurate predictor of downturns in the past.

"As governor, Mitt Romney raised nursing home fees eight times."	Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.

The Paris Agreement is by far the largest number of countries ever to sign an international agreement on a single day.	Trade ministers and officials from 16 Asian countries agreed Sunday to speed up negotiations on outstanding issues and reach a basic agreement on a regional trade pact by the end of this year. During weekend meetings, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe urged fellow leaders to work for an early conclusion of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership in the face of an increasingly protectionist U.S.
Japan has sought to take leadership in shaping the pact as an alternative to a Pacific Rim free-trade grouping that Trump abandoned early this year, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. At a joint news conference Sunday after the talks, Japanese Economy, Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshige Seko and his Singaporean counterpart, Chan Chun Sing, noted there are differences that still need to be resolved, but the participants see reaching an accord as evidence of Asia's commitment to defending free trade. "This is indeed a moment for us to seize the opportunity against a global backdrop where we are facing headwinds in the trade relationships and the trade regimes," Chan said. Achieving a pact would be a powerful statement to show what RCEP countries stand for, he said.

A staunch ally of oil and gas companies, Pruitt stacked EPA advisory boards with industry representatives and sought to set aside whole troves of research that link pollution to various illnesses. He oversaw the delay or destruction of dozens of clean air and water rules, sparking legal battles with states and environmental groups. The EPA’s record in court under Pruitt was patchy but his deregulatory zeal was enough to impress Trump, who said Pruitt was doing a “fantastic job” even as scandals that sparked more than a dozen different investigations swirled around him. Pruitt became a trusted advisor to Trump, helping convince the president the US should withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.

Ireland to vote over constitution clause on women's role in the home
Ireland will hold a referendum to remove a clause in the constitution marking the importance of a woman’s “life within the home” and encouraging mothers to shun paid employment to fulfil domestic duties, the government has announced. The move unveiled on Thursday is the latest to update Ireland’s socially conservative 1937 constitution to reflect a more secular and socially liberal population. Ireland was long one of Europe’s most socially conservative countries, but opinions have changed rapidly in recent decades as the power of the Roman Catholic church has waned. A 2015 referendum introduced gay marriage into the constitution and a vote earlier this year allowed access to abortion. The constitution, which includes a number of references to the country’s traditional Christian ethos, currently contains a clause that “recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the state a support without which the common good cannot be achieved”.

However Yad Vashem said this contradicted decades of historical research and contained "grave errors and deceptions".

Department of Health and Social Care figures show that only 6,000 of 18,000 medical school applicants were awarded places last year — with many of the 6,000 likely going to foreign applicants, who have often been favoured over British applicants. In fact, the Mail found that so many talented would-be medical students were being rejected that a cottage industry of English-language medical schools in countries such as Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Armenia, and Georgia have sprung up to cater to them — but even this option is not available to youngsters who cannot afford the fees.

But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.
"President Barack Obama suggested on national TV that the Democratic health care bill will have government decide that a healthy, 100-year-old woman in need of a pacemaker should take a pain pill instead."	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
"On immigration, the president said 22 times, 22 times, that he couldnt do what he eventually did."	That has not been true of all past presidents. Andrew Jackson famously dismissed a court decision against his forced removal of the Cherokees from Georgia by saying: “The chief justice has made his ruling. Now let him enforce it.” As for today’s controversial immigration policies separating children from parents, they are, sadly, legal - a reminder that something may be immoral but not also illegal, and also a reminder that laws must be continually revised to reflect our highest societal moral standards. The Trump administration has also become adept at finding obscure, long dormant “national security” clauses in the federal codex to invoke as justification for steel and aluminum tariffs as well as punitive tariffs on Chinese goods (the latter has been announced but not yet enacted). These may be stupid policy, but they are not illegal - yet.
We have had some significant accomplishments on a bipartisan basis.	Lyft, like Uber, is moving beyond cars. The ride-hailing startup on Monday announced it will acquire Motivate, the largest bikeshare operator in North America. Motivate operates Citi Bike in New York and Capital Bikeshare in Washington DC, among other brands. The move comes as Lyft has been expanding its reach in the transportation space. It has integrated public transit in its app and introduced Lyft Line, which lets users share a ride with strangers who are going to destinations close together.
Weve lifted high school graduation rates to new highs.	Of the challenge, Freeman says: “I have a personal and family background in the health service, and I have nothing but admiration for every person who works in our NHS whatever their job is. There have always been challenges and demands on the NHS and that will continue. I will continue and build on the commitment and excellent work of Shona Robison, my predecessor. One of the successes of our health service is that people are living longer, and that puts different demands on it. So it is critical that we are, together, able to adapt and change to meet those demands.”

State agencies have not identified one single instance where groundwater has been damaged due to hydraulic fracking.	At least 12 people have reportedly been taken into custody in connection with a lynching of five people in Dhule, India. An incited crowd killed the five villagers after a rumor circulating on Whatsapp fueled speculation that they were child kidnappers, according to The Associated Press and local media reports. The group of men were cornered by dozens of people as they were passing through a village, the AP said. The men were all members of a nomadic community who pass through villages in order to beg, local newspaper The Hindu reported. One of the men was seen talking to a girl, which prompted questions from villagers that escalated into violence as more people gathered around, according to the newspaper.
"When SACS came back to the DeKalb County School District to give a midterm review, we got straight As."	There never was a rational reason for creating a “buffer zone.” This attendance status allowed enrollment at either Central or South high schools. Hinsdale High School District 86 history shows that buffer zone residents chose Central attendance at a 9 to 1 ratio compared to the choice for South. Yes, it is a fact that buffer zone status did increase property values.The two board members voting not to eliminate buffer zone status live within those attendance boundaries. This June 1, a discrimination complaint was filed against District 86 with the United States Office of Civil Rights. The complaint cites (1) unlawful discrimination due to fixing unlawful attendance boundaries, (2) continued expansion of those boundaries, as well as (3) curricular disparity between the two high schools.
"In the do-nothing Senate, there are 352 House bills sitting on Harry Reids desk awaiting action, including 55 introduced by Democrats."	You've had Senators Joe Donnelly, Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp, who are the three red state Democrats who voted in favor of Neil Gorsuch, get their only personal meeting with President Trump and who say they are very open to confirming President Trump nominee who -- if the nominee is the right person. So those are the five senators who our attention is going to be really on for the next two months. BRENNAN: And what about immigration, Jan?

"The president of the republic and his government will be absolutely respectful and support the authorities that are elected," Pena Nieto told reporters. Hovering over the election is the specter of vote fraud, though electoral officials deny it is a possibility with the modern balloting technology and institutions now in place. In both of Lopez Obrador's previous two presidential losses he alleged fraud. In his first loss — by a mere 0.56 percent to conservative Felipe Calderon in 2006 — his supporters held months-long protests in Mexico City and he referred to himself as "the legitimate president." His allies are warning even before Sunday's presidential vote that there better not be any funny business.
I know that Hillary on occasion has said just last year said this (NAFTA) was a boon to the economy.	“We are not going to fight. We are always going to seek for there to be an agreement. … We are going to extend our frank hand to seek a relation of friendship, I repeat, of cooperation with the United States.”
Trump was equally tactful, telling reporters: “I think he’s going to try and help us with the border. “I think the relationship will be a very good one,” the US president said of the Mexican politician, whose swearing-in will be in December. “We talked about trade, we talked about Nafta, we talked about a separate deal, just Mexico and the United States.”
Such restraint contrasted with Trump’s call to López Obrador’s predecessor, weeks after his inauguration last year.

It’s not strictly true to say everyone is against the three huge plant-forested glass spheres at what Amazon calls its “campus” in the heart of the city. The Bezos balls, as the conservatories are popularly known, are modelled on the greenhouses at London’s Kew Gardens, feature walkways above fig trees, ferns and rhododendrons, and provide hot-desking for Amazon workers looking for a break from the neighbouring office tower. There was nothing in that area 10 years ago,” said Jen Reed, selling jerky from another market stall. “I don’t hate Amazon the way that a lot of people hate them.

Sen.Mark Begich cast the deciding vote in favor of President Obamas authority to issue executive amnesty to illegal aliens.	The strategy reprises last year's successful approach to confirming Justice Neil Gorsuch in the early spring of 2017. Gorsuch was named to fill the vacancy left by the death of Antonin Scalia and then kept open by the refusal of the Senate's Republican majority to consider Merrick Garland, the replacement named by President Barack Obama in 2016. Gorsuch was greeted with delight by abortion opponents, even though he had not ruled directly on Roe in his judicial career. But his confirmation was far from a sure thing because two Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, were seen as defenders of abortion rights.

There are 49 different federal job training programs that report to eight agencies.	PORTLAND, Ore. -- Two opposing protest groups -- Patriot Prayer and antifa -- clashed in downtown Portland Saturday, CBS Portland affiliate KOIN reports. Portland police said failure to leave the area could leave to arrests, calling the demonstration a riot. More than 100 members of Patriot Prayer group gathered at Terry Schrunk Plaza for a "freedom rally," while more than 100 counter protesters with an antifa group gathered across the street at Chapman Square for rallies before a march. Police revoked Patriot Prayer's permit for the rally after the two groups began to clash. People were lighting firecrackers and smoke bombs in the crowd while police used flash bangs in an effort to disperse the clashing protesters.
The U.S. economy is recovering slower than Europe	The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said. Carney said the impact from the president’s use of import tariffs against major trading partners including the EU and China, alongside their retaliatory measures, was already being seen through measures of global exports and manufacturing in recent weeks. “There are some tentative signs that this more hostile and uncertain trading environment may be dampening activity,” he said. Surveys of factory output in the US and the eurozone earlier this week showed firms were facing higher prices as a consequence of the import tariffs, as well as American manufacturers having the longest delivery delays on record.
Texas leads the country in drunk driving fatalities.	As motorists pay more to fill their tanks this Independence Day -- with gas prices at a four-year high for the holiday -- safety advocates are urging caution during celebrations that turn deadly on U.S. roadways. The national average for a gallon of gas on Tuesday stood at $2.86, making it the costliest for an Independence Day holiday in four years, according to AAA. That said, the nearly 40 million motorists expected to travel this week will pay 11 cents less per gallon at the pump than they did this past Memorial Day holiday, the motorist club noted. "The national gas price average has held fairly steady for the past 10 days, suggesting that U.S. demand is keeping pace with supply and stabilizing summer gas prices," a spokesperson for the motorist group said in a statement. "However, elevated crude oil prices and other geopolitical concerns could tilt gas prices more expensive in the early fall despite an expected increase in global crude production from OPEC and its partners."
"Romneycare has killed 18,000 Massachusetts jobs."

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., all floated as possible 2020 presidential candidates, have backed the call to abolish the agency. "The president's deeply immoral actions have made it obvious we need to rebuild our immigration system from top to bottom starting by replacing ICE with something that reflects our morality and that works," Warren said on Saturday. Pence, in his speech Friday, blasted those Democrats and said it was a sign that "opposition of ICE has moved to the center of the Democratic Party." "Just when you thought the Democrats couldn’t move any farther to the left, leading members of the Democratic Party, including candidates for higher officer, are actually openly advocating the abolition of ICE – an agency that protects the American people and our communities every single day."

It says the areas of concern include the Pacific Crest Trail, Mount Ashland and the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument.
"When President Obama took office, we were losing 700,000 jobs a month. Now weve had job growth, I think, for 24 consecutive months."	While Blackstone Vice President Tony James offered some useful common-sense economic and political advice for Democrats, it was a bit of a head-scratcher to read his unsubstantiated declaration that “some of the current expansion is built on the foundation laid by the Obama administration.” Mr. James’s praise for the previous administration sounds a lot like the laughable claim by President Obama himself that America’s current economic vitality and growth are really due to the fact that he had the economy “set up well” for Mr. Trump. If by “set up well,” President Obama meant that the economy had been driven so far into the ground and smothered by excessive regulation and high taxes that almost anything that followed his antibusiness policies would be a success, then there would have been some merit in his claim. But does anyone think that’s what he’s saying?While Blackstone Vice President Tony James offered some useful common-sense economic and political advice for Democrats, it was a bit of a head-scratcher to read his unsubstantiated declaration that “some of the current expansion is built on the foundation laid by the Obama administration.” Mr. James’s praise for the previous administration sounds a lot like the laughable claim by President Obama himself that America’s current economic vitality and growth are really due to the fact that he had the economy “set up well” for Mr. Trump.While Blackstone Vice President Tony James offered some useful common-sense economic and political advice for Democrats, it was a bit of a head-scratcher to read his unsubstantiated declaration that “some of the current expansion is built on the foundation laid by the Obama administration.” Mr. James’s praise for the previous administration sounds a lot like the laughable claim by President Obama himself that America’s current economic vitality and growth are really due to the fact that he had the economy “set up well” for Mr. Trump.
"We in the Democratic Party had no input into the locations of these hearings, nor did we have input into the process."	Findings by the intelligence community that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election to help Donald Trump win were "accurate and on point," said an unclassified report by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released Tuesday. The committee's findings came after a lengthy review of the "sources, tradecraft and analytic work underpinning" a January 2017 intelligence community assessment. The FBI's and CIA's "analytical disagreement" with the NSA over whether Russia sought to bolster the Trump presidential campaign was "reasonable," the report also said. While the FBI and CIA had "high confidence" that Russian President Vladimir Putin aspired to help Trump's election chances by denigrating opponent Hillary Clinton, the NSA had only "moderate confidence" in that assessment, according to the January 2017 analysis. The disagreement among agencies "was reasonable, transparent, and openly debated among the agencies and analysts, with analysts, managers and agency heads on both sides of the confidence level articulately justifying their positions," the Senate intelligence committee's findings said.

In its statement, Delancey said it remained committed to ensuring the continued maintenance of the centre but added that it was over 50 years old, “and as is often the way with older buildings, some elements do unfortunately fail”. The delay in repairing the escalator was because it was so old, spare parts were no longer made and had to be specially manufactured, the spokeswoman said. The shopping centre has long attracted scorn and been dismissed as an eyesore – not least because of its “manky, hot-pink” exterior, as Time Out once put it – but some see that as part of its charm, with the Guardian’s property section once describing it approvingly as the “anti-Westfield”.

Says Charlie Crist raised taxes on the middle class by $2.2 billion.	3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.

Most of the incidents involved the amputation of fingers or fingertips, but there were recordings of lost hands, arms or toes. During the period there were a total of 550 serious injuries which cover 22 of the 50 states so the true total for the USA would be substantially higher. Recorded injuries include:
An employee’s left arm had to be surgically amputated at the shoulder after it was pulled into the cubing machine during sanitation

Odds of winning the Monopoly Millionaire instant win game are 1 in 3.27.	Elections frenzy continues in emerging markets and after Turkey last week, it’s Mexico’s turn on Sunday. Polls predict that former Mexico City mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will be the next president, possibly garnering over half of the votes. This is the third bid for the key job by AMLO as the leftist Lopez Obrador is commonly known; his popularity has grown hand in hand with Mexicans’ anger at the failure of traditional parties to end record levels of violence and corruption. His history of protest politics has unnerved investors though and while throughout this campaign AMLO has courted Wall Street, he has still pledged to review a 2013 opening of the oil industry to private producers. The vote comes at a delicate point for Mexico, which is at odds with the United States over migration and trade, while talks on reworking the NAFTA trade agreement are deadlocked.

New Jersey has had seven credit downgrades since Chris Christie became governor.	Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.

If the British government has any sense it will give this green vanity project the same treatment it did to the similarly stupid Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon Project and pull the plug before any more taxpayers’ money is poured down the drain. Unfortunately, though, the decision is in the hands of Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Greg Clark.

Our Founding Fathers resolved that without freedom Americans could not enjoy life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. To secure it, they fought a war to break free from the bonds of tyranny.

This tyrant sits on a throne in our minds and is just as cruel as King George was during the time of the Founders.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.
Says he started the Pacur plastics manufacturing company he owns.	This account of the previously undisclosed conversation comes from a senior administration official familiar with what was said. In an exchange that lasted around five minutes, McMaster and others took turns explaining to Trump how military action could backfire and risk losing hard-won support among Latin American governments to punish President Nicolas Maduro for taking Venezuela down the path of dictatorship, according to the official. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the discussions. Although he gave no indication he was about to order up military plans, he pointed to what he considered past cases of successful gunboat diplomacy in the region, according to the official, like the invasions of Panama and Grenada in the 1980s.

A major North Sea wind power development off Aberdeen which was opposed by Donald Trump has generated its first power. A total of 11 turbines make up the European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre (EOWDC). Power from the wind farm, developed by Swedish energy group Vattenfall, is being exported to the National Grid. Mr Trump battled unsuccessfully in the courts to halt the project before he became US president. He said they would spoil the view from his Aberdeenshire golf course at Menie.

"When the Milwaukee County mental health facility is full, cops sit out there in their squad cars with a mentally ill patient and sometimes spend an entire shift out there doing that."	California is dismantling its protective custody program for vulnerable inmates after the population boomed and spawned problems of its own with gangs, drugs and assaults. WHEN DID THE PROGRAM START? The state began identifying certain vulnerable inmates as needing special protective housing in the late 1990s, and created so-called Sensitive Needs Yards for them starting in early 2002. More than 40 of the yards are now scattered within 20 of California's 34 prisons. WHAT ARE SENSITIVE NEEDS YARDS?
"Says Mitt Romney is proposing a tax cut that gives an average of $250,000 to every millionaire in this country."	3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.
"Says Abortion clinics in Oregon, as in most states, have no state oversight and are not held to basic health or safety standards."	Hope Life Center in western Illinois provides unplanned pregnancy counseling and ultrasounds for about five to 10 women a week, with a mission to “erase abortion from Illinois one woman and one child at time,” according to its website. So Executive Director Debbie Case was alarmed by a change last year in the state's so-called right-of-conscience law, requiring health care providers to inform pregnant patients of all available medical options, including abortion. She said the pregnancy center even shut down for part of 2017 because its physician feared potential repercussions of violating the law, which is now temporarily blocked by the courts. Case and other anti-abortion advocates across the state hailed Tuesday’s ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court against a similar law in California on First Amendment grounds, hoping the decision will strengthen their legal battle in Illinois. “We’re definitely encouraged,” said Case, whose center is in Sterling, about two hours west of Chicago.
The budget for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is only about 1 percent of the amount banks generate just from late fees and overdraft fees.	Among those reported to be among the top of President Donald Trump’s short list is Judge Brett Kavanaugh on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The prospect of a Justice Kavanaugh worries some consumer advocates, who say he has taken an activist position against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the regulator implemented in the wake of the Great Recession in the hopes of thwarting future financial meltdowns. “Kavanaugh’s track record has shown tremendous sympathy to political rhetoric, more so than to established precedent as it relates to the Bureau,” said Aaron Klein, director of the Center on Regulation and Markets at the Brookings Institution. “His ruling was closer to congressional talking points than legal precedent.”
Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center, said that the center doesn’t weigh in on potential judicial appointees, but that open hostility to the agency’s mission would be cause for concern. “Obviously, it would be concerning if there was a justice that was inclined to invalidate the CFPB,” she said.
Says that Rick Santorum voted for the unions over FedEx.	BREAKING: @NEAToday President @Lily_NEA reacts to radical ruling by #SCOTUS: "We are living in a system that is rigged to benefit special interests & billionaires, all at the expense of working people." FULL STATEMENT: https://t.co/uE4j5lQPGh #Janus #JanusvAFSCME #Union — NEA Public Relations (@NEAMedia) June 27, 2018
A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.
"When President AbrahamLincoln signed his Emancipation Proclamation, there were over 300,000 slaveholders who were fighting in the Union army."	On the Fourth of July, 1852, America celebrated its freedom, as it does every Independence Day. Frederick Douglass, America’s most famous anti-slavery activist and fugitive slave, saw no ground to celebrate: he saw the octopus arms of slavery stretched everywhere, exposing the hollowness of America’s freedom values. That holiday, he delivered the greatest antislavery speech in American history. Not least since the racism that made slavery endures.
Eighty-three law enforcement officers have died in the line of duty this year. Twenty-four of them were shot and killed in cold blood.

Repeated requests for additional security in Benghazi were routinely denied by Hillary Clintons State Department.	The report also said that Strzok repeatedly pushed for more aggressive action in the Clinton probe. "The conduct by these employees cast a cloud over the entire FBI investigation and sowed doubt about the FBI’s work," the report concluded. "The damage caused by these employees’ actions extends far beyond the scope of the (Clinton) investigation and goes to the heart of the FBI’s reputation for neutral fact finding and political independence." Goelman, in an op-ed in USA TODAY last month, said Strzok has become the victim of "political gamesmanship" by Congress and President Trump, who has repeatedly tweeted about Strzok as evidence of bias by the FBI and Justice Department. "They have spent months cynically taking these texts out of context and saying that one- or two-word snippets somehow prove that the FBI investigations of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the Russia probe itself, were biased," Goelman wrote.

A recurring insult being used is "Natashas" - a derogatory term used to describe girls and young women who end up being sold as sex slaves after having been lured by the promises of legitimate employment. But the disrespectful treatment of women isn't contained online - some traditional media outlets have also joined in. The daily Moskovsky Komsomolets published an article with the headline "The time of whores: Russians in the World Cup disgrace themselves and the country". On TV, the topic was discussed on Channel One's programme Time Will Show, where potentially gullible women should be reminded "these men are just here for a holiday".

He was also fairly popular as mayor and ended his term with a very respectable approval rating.

It has been 536 days since power-sharing in Northern Ireland collapsed - 536 days without ministers to oversee the running of Stormont's nine departments. In the absence of an executive, civil servants were left uncertain about what decisions to take, and who should take them. The long-running court case over the proposed Arc21 waste incinerator in County Antrim raised questions about exactly that conundrum. The judgement upholding a ruling that a senior civil servant did not have the power to act without ministerial approval in the case of the incinerator could have massive implications for future governance in Northern Ireland. Here are some of the key parts of the judgement and what they mean.

LOUIE! Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, says it’s possible that staff for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein are monitoring his actions. ‘I’ve been told in the past there’s been great concern about who I saw, what I did and that I was being monitored and was even told they know everybody that walks in your office,’ Gohmert said Monday in an interview on Fox Business’s ‘Lou Dobbs Tonight.’” (via Washington Examiner).
"Less than two years ago, we made a commitment to repay the U.S. . . .taxpayers in full, and today we made good on that promise."	Just hours after his historic election victory sent thousands of supporters pouring on to the streets, the 64-year-old leftist tweeted that he had received a call from Donald Trump. “I proposed that we explore an integral agreement of development projects, which generate jobs in Mexico and with that reduce migration and improve security. There was respectful treatment and our representatives will speak more.”
In an interview with the Televisa news network, López Obrador emphasized the need for mutual respect and cooperation between the two neighbors. “We are conscious of the need to maintain good relations with the United States.

“He had a very excellent election that, I would say, even better than anticipated,” said President Trump, who told a story about years ago predicting Obrador’s election to the office of President in Mexico. “I told him a number of years ago when I saw him campaigning for a different race, frankly, a different year, a different race, I said he’ll be someday he’s going to be the President of Mexico. So he remembered that and it turned out to be correct.”

Millennials will be 75 percent of the workforce in the next 10 years.	The use of robots to commune with people with Alzheimer’s opens up a whole box of moral quandaries, not least the prospect of some cognitive threshold beneath which patients will be pushed into the arms of machines, rather than humans. It is worth remembering too that like the digital “assistants” now entering people’s homes, Pepper and the current robo-carers do not offer anything approaching the nuances and complexities of genuine human interchange, rather an app store version that most people would consider a matter of erratic entertainment rather than a day-do-day necessity. But as and when robots manage to convincingly perform as make-believe humans, what then? Paradoxically, key voices in the tech world have long believed that as automation sweeps through large swathes of the economy, with the right fiscal adjustments, it will increase the numbers of human caregivers, and elevate them above the low-paid parts of the labour market where such roles are currently concentrated. Last year, for example, a writer in Wired magazine said that such roles as “companions to the elderly, home health aides, babysitters, special-needs aides, and more” demanded to be taken more seriously, and that “the riches resulting from increased automation … could be used to help fund caregiving programs”.
Over 60 percent of the provisional ballots cast in [the 2012] election were disqualified because those folks were not duly registered as voters.	"The president of the republic and his government will be absolutely respectful and support the authorities that are elected," Pena Nieto told reporters. Hovering over the election is the specter of vote fraud, though electoral officials deny it is a possibility with the modern balloting technology and institutions now in place. In both of Lopez Obrador's previous two presidential losses he alleged fraud. In his first loss — by a mere 0.56 percent to conservative Felipe Calderon in 2006 — his supporters held months-long protests in Mexico City and he referred to himself as "the legitimate president." His allies are warning even before Sunday's presidential vote that there better not be any funny business.

Extreme partisanship in Congress has led the legislature to relinquish its power to the presidency and the court, Edwards said. People say the founders would roll over in their graves – I think the founders would hang themselves Mickey Edwards, Aspen Institute
“We now have become so accustomed to thinking of things – whether it’s foreign policy or trade policy or other things that the Congress has constitutional authority over – we now look at them all as presidential powers,” Edwards said. “So the presidency has grown much stronger. “I would also say that the supreme court has grown stronger and it’s become more partisan, which is very disturbing.”
Not only has the court become more powerful, analysts say, but it also appears to have become increasingly insulated from the concerns of Main Street. While Trump’s short list of potential nominees to replace Kennedy is long on academic pedigrees, advocates question whether the next justice will have practical sympathies commensurate with the power he or she will have over average American lives.
The vast majority of people in this country are keeping their (health insurance) plan.	Those factories are the core of an American operation that employs about 136,000 people, but they're also dependent on components sourced overseas for reasons of cost or availability.

Toyota on June 27 said that Trump's threatened 25 percent tariff on automotive imports would add $1,800 to the price of each sedan. The carmaker's warning of the dangers of tit-for-tat tariffs was just one of many. German lighting manufacturer Osram Licht's shares plunged 22 percent Thursday after it announced a weaker outlook due to trade tensions.

We are seeing kids who are healthier.	The Republican Party is rotting away. The problem is that GOP policies just aren’t popular. Most Americans unsurprisingly oppose climate denial, tax cuts for the wealthy, and putting children (including toddlers) in concentration camps, for example.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Fred Knapp/NET News Fred Knapp/NET News
Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.
"McCain says the price of a gas tax ""holiday"" would be about the same as ""a Bridge to Nowhere (or) another pork barrel project."""	As motorists pay more to fill their tanks this Independence Day -- with gas prices at a four-year high for the holiday -- safety advocates are urging caution during celebrations that turn deadly on U.S. roadways. The national average for a gallon of gas on Tuesday stood at $2.86, making it the costliest for an Independence Day holiday in four years, according to AAA. That said, the nearly 40 million motorists expected to travel this week will pay 11 cents less per gallon at the pump than they did this past Memorial Day holiday, the motorist club noted. "The national gas price average has held fairly steady for the past 10 days, suggesting that U.S. demand is keeping pace with supply and stabilizing summer gas prices," a spokesperson for the motorist group said in a statement. "However, elevated crude oil prices and other geopolitical concerns could tilt gas prices more expensive in the early fall despite an expected increase in global crude production from OPEC and its partners."

Says required state septic inspections would cost septic tank owners $100 to $150 every five years.	Full-service restaurants with more elaborate menus and more complex processes, like the Red Hen and those in The Trump Organization properties, are more vulnerable to violations than fast-food eateries with limited food offerings and a streamlined kitchen production line, said Craig Hedberg, a professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Minnesota. And those with repeated violations can get into even more trouble with their local health departments, said Hedberg. Those eateries will be flagged by inspectors, who bring copies of previous reports on their visits and can spot patterns of regulation flouting. How repeat offenses are handled differs by jurisdiction. “It’s very rare to see a perfect score,” he said.

The Democrats’ top leader in the Senate, Sen. Chuck Schumer, is keeping his distance from the “Abolish ICE” campaign. He is instead using his Twitter account to tout Democrats’ promises on healthcare, guns, gay status, and claims that President Donald Trump is tied to Russian President Vladimir Putin. On the Abolish ICE campaign, Schumer is instead calling for a “czar” to focus media attention on “reunifying families.” That topic polls better for Democrats than ending immigration enforcement.

Uncompensated care has gone down by 30 percent just in the first few months of Medicaid expansion in the states that adopted it.	Nebraska May Join Utah, Idaho in Putting Medicaid Expansion Before Voters

Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.
"Every time weve cut the capital gains tax, the economy has grown. Whenever we raise the capital gains tax, its been damaged."	Delivering a speech in Newcastle on Thursday, he said: “At the moment, protectionism is largely just talk (and tweets). But what if rhetoric becomes reality?”
Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.
Says Jason Carter has gotten David Axelrod to come down and be his campaign advisor.	“[Bannon] can help us with his experience, with his knowledge—advising us on how to campaign and make our message reach more people.”
Ortega expects the Darth Vader of international politics to visit Spain “soon.” Bannon was meant to meet with Vox in May, but Bannon is busier than ever, Ortega says, after going back to being an adviser to Trump. The Vox general secretary seems to have gotten his wires crossed on that count, unless there’s something Trump and Bannon aren’t telling us. Steve Bannon’s press office declined multiple requests for comment. “There’s never been a party like Vox. Since the birth of the Spanish Constitution a party that defends what Vox defends has never existed,” Ortega says.
Kilmartin has helped pass laws to create a witness protection program.	The new law - approved by 87 votes to 15 in the 120-seat Knesset late on Monday - requires the Israeli government to withhold an amount of tax revenue equal to what is paid by the PA to "individuals who were involved in terror activity against Israelis and their families". If the defence ministry determines that such payments are no longer being made, the frozen funds will be returned to the PA.
Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman hailed the legislation, saying: "An effective war on terrorism also passes through the pocket - of the terrorists, of their families and of [Palestinian Authority President] Mahmoud Abbas." Image copyright AFP Image caption The law's sponsors said the PA's payments were "an expression of support for acts of terror"
But chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat condemned what he called a "very dangerous decision that amounts to the cancellation of the Palestinian Authority and is piracy and theft". The PA's Minister of Prisoner Affairs, Issa Qaraqeh, meanwhile insisted the payments would continue. "When we signed Oslo Agreement, it was clear to Israel that the Palestinian Authority pays these families, and they never objected," he was quoted as saying by the Associated Press.

She urged others in her position, the “pissed-off moms,” to continue to speak out against White House policies, saying, regardless of nerves, “it’s always worth it.”
I havent switched my position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.	President Trump’s reshaping of the GOP from being aligned to the Chamber of Commerce to a party serving the interests of America’s working and middle class is winning over young white American men en masse. Ahead of Trump’s election to the presidency in 2016, nearly 50 percent of young white men favored Democrats, and 36 percent favored the GOP. That 14-point gain has flipped, and young white men now favor the GOP over the Democrats by 46 percent to 37 percent. At the time, the GOP was aligned with the big business lobby and Wall Street in promoting endless multinational free trade that readily outsourced American jobs to foreign countries. The Republican establishment, in 2016, was pushing the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which would have eliminated millions of working and middle-class jobs while also driving down wages for remaining American workers.
Says Barack Obama is the first president to appoint 45 czars to replace elected officials in his office.	It's difficult to imagine Old Hickory, as he was known, excusing himself from military duty on the grounds that he could not march long distances, as Mr Trump did during the Vietnam War, citing bone spurs. The parallels between the 45th president and the 13th - unlucky for some - are arguably more compelling. Fillmore launched his career in the 1820s with the Anti-Masonic Party, hawking a paranoid rumour that ruling Freemasons were murdering whistleblowers. Mr Trump paved the way for his White House bid by peddling a conspiracy theory, too - that President Barack Obama was not a US citizen.

Fillmore later joined the Whig Party at a time of mounting hostility to refugees from famine, rebellion and tyranny who were arriving by the shipload at the gates of the New World.
John Boehner wants to reopen a tax loophole that actually rewarded corporations for shipping jobs and profits overseas.	In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners. Alas, he is wasting his time trying to shift the views of the Democratic Party, which has become ever more left-wing, if not outright socialist. I think it is time for Mr. James to become a Republican. Guy Randolph
Savannah, Ga.
It’s shocking that Mr. James is surprised by the positive economic results of less regulation and lower taxes.

Florida seniors are exempt from losing Medicare Advantage under the federal health care bill.	"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.
"Theres a tremendous tax that we pay when we (American businesses) go into China, whereas when China sells to us theres no tax."	So we have 50 plus 200 plus almost 300.”
Analysts say tariffs are not the most effective way of putting pressure on China, which the US accuses of unfair trade practices and stealing intellectual property from US companies. Syracuse University economics professor Mary Lovely and researcher Yang Liang found 87% of electronics products to be levied by US tariffs came from multinationals and joint ventures rather than Chinese firms. China’s economy is no longer as dependent on exports. Domestic consumption now accounts for more than half of the country’s GDP. Exports to the US account for only 19% of all of China’s exports.
I am very proud that over my almost 30 years of public service I have had no scandals.	I've only ever known working for the NHS. "There have been lots of changes since I started. We had a matron in charge at Llandough and girls were not allowed to wear trousers to work! "I have loved my job, meeting lots of lovely patients and colleagues throughout my career and although I missed Llandough when gynaecology moved to the Heath four years ago, I am still enjoying working for the NHS at the age of 70."
Pat Toomey advocated for eliminating all corporate taxes.	They include the United States withdrawing its 28,500 troops in South Korea, ending its military drills with South Korea and stop bringing in strategic assets such as aircraft carriers and nuclear-capable bombers. North Korea hasn't repeated such specific demands since entering disarmament talks earlier this year, raising optimism that the country truly appeared to seek to improve ties with the United States. After the summit, Trump suspended annual military training with South Korea that the North has called an invasion rehearsal. But North Korea still prefers a step-by-step disarmament process with reciprocal concessions and benefits from the United States for each of the North's denuclearization steps. The ultimate rewards North Korea wants range from the easing or lifting of American-led international sanctions, the signing of a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, the establishment of diplomatic ties and the pulling out of U.S. troops in South Korea, experts say.
"Health care reform ""requires the use of federal dollars to fund abortions through the government-run health plan."""	The federal government provides about 80 percent of the state's Medicaid funds. The cuts to dental and vision benefits were supposed to affect only able-bodied adults, mostly those added to Medicaid under an expansion authorized through the Affordable Care Act. Advocates say the cutoff of vision and dental benefits is unnecessary and possibly illegal. Bevin's administration announced the cuts after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Friday rejected Bevin's sweeping plan to overhaul the state's Medicaid program. The plan would have eliminated dental and vision benefits for such individuals, although they could earn points toward purchasing such services with a "My Rewards" account through activities such as volunteering or taking online classes.
"A lot of what (Cubas) survival depends on is Venezuelan oil money, which is drying up."	Crimes such as robbery remain rampant across Venezuela amid the country’s dire economic and humanitarian crisis, leading growing numbers of people to turn to violence merely to ensure survival. Kidnappings, armed robberies, and violent attacks are now commonplace. Venezuela is widely considered one of the most dangerous destinations in the world. As noted by El Nacional, “There are many travelers who have been stripped of money, luggage, and vehicles on the Caracas-La Guaira highway, especially at night and early morning when the road is little traveled and lacks surveillance.”
The doctors were present in Venezuela as part of an agreement between the two countries. Venezuela typically pays for the doctors in vast quantities of oil, an initiative that started under Hugo Chávez and Fidel Castro.

XI ASSERTS TERRITORIAL CLAIMS IN MEETING WITH US DEFENSE SECRETARY
Chinese President Xi Jinping strongly asserted China's determination to defend territory it claims, including in the South China Sea, in a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. While the tone of Mattis' visit to Beijing was largely upbeat, Xi made sure to reinforce his reputation as a fervent nationalist when it comes to issues of sovereignty. Though Xi gave no specifics in his statement, he was largely seen as indicating the South China Sea as well as self-governing Taiwan. China also claims territory held by India and uninhabited East China Sea islands controlled by Japan.
Says Obama called Kagan a moderate. He called Sotomayor a moderate.	You can’t push any group of people that hard, that fast and for that long and expect them to maintain their composure.”
Eric Young, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees’ Council of Prison Locals, now prays before he looks at his phone every morning, worried he’ll receive a message from BOP’s director notifying him of a staff death. Young estimates that around two-thirds of his union members were Trump supporters. That makes sense: It’s a law enforcement agency that leans white and male (72 percent male, 62 percent white), and many federal prisons are in rural parts of the country, which Trump dominated. But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau. BOP has long suffered the kind of problems you’d expect for a massive bureaucracy centered on caging tens of thousands of people.
"Today and every day, an estimated 14,000 Americans will lose their health insurance coverage."	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
Darryl Hicks had seven ethics violations and didnt pay most of the fines.	"We have made tremendous progress and the future of the EPA is very bright!" In his resignation letter to Trump, Pruitt said: "It is extremely difficult for me to cease serving you in this role first because I count it a blessing to be serving you in any capacity, but also, because of the transformative work that is occurring. "However, the unrelenting attacks on me personally [and] my family, are unprecedented and have taken a sizable toll on all of us," Pruitt added. Pruitt resigned less than a week after The New York Times reported that the EPA's chief ethics official, Kevin Minoli, had been pushing for a series of independent investigation into several aspects of Pruitt's tenure. Those include Pruitt's rental of a Washington D.C. condominium for $50 per day from the spouse of a prominent fossil fuel lobbyist and his alleged use of staff to handle personal matters.
"Since President Obama came into office, another 2 million Hispanics have joined the ranks of those in poverty. The number of Hispanic children living in poverty increased by 15 percent in that short period of time."	Lopez Obrador has promised a "transformation" of Mexico and pledged to give scholarships or paid apprenticeships to youth, and increase support payments for the elderly. But rivals warn that a Lopez Obrador could set the country back decades with an interventionist economic policy. All the candidates are lambasting President Donald Trump's policies against migrants and Mexico, but voters were wondering who could best deal with Trump. Sunday's elections for posts at every level of government are Mexico's largest ever and have become a referendum on corruption, graft and other tricks used to divert taxpayer money to officials' pockets and empty those of the country's poor. This is Lopez Obrador's third bid for the presidency and some see it as his best shot after 12 years of near-permanent campaigning.
The top 1 percent in recent years has earned 85 percent of all new income.	The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks picked up 1.1 percent to 1,679.48. Benchmark U.S. crude added 9 cents to $73.03 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract plunged $1.20, or 1.6 percent, to settle at $72.94 per barrel Thursday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 14 cents to $77.25 per barrel in London. It slid 85 cents, or 1.1 percent, to close at $77.39 per barrel on Thursday.
Forty percent of the Fortune 500 were started either by immigrants or children of immigrants.	These numbers are similar to those from a February Quinnipiac poll, where 49 percent of voters said Trump was racist and 46 percent said he was not. Forty-four percent of voters said they think “racist beliefs” were a motive in Trump’s immigration policy, while 50 percent said Trump has “a sincere interest in controlling our borders.” Sixty percent said the policy of separating children from their parents at the border was a violation of human rights. Since enacting the policy, Trump and his associates have repeatedly pushed false, racist narratives to garner support, often associating immigration with high crime rates despite no evidence to support claims that immigrants commit more crime than U.S. citizens. While only 11 percent of Republican voters in the Quinnipiac poll said they think Trump is a racist, 22 percent said they believe Trump has emboldened racist people to express their beliefs publicly. The number of hate crimes rose the year Trump was elected ― the first increase in over a decade.
The group that organized Texas Muslim Capitol Day in Austin was recently listed as one of 82 organizations designated as a terrorist group by the United Arab Emirates.	While most of these foreign doctors are perfectly capable, a disproportionate number turn out to be incompetent, with more than half of doctors subject to ‘fitness to practice’ investigation by the General Medical Council (GMC) being non-British. Critics suggest that plundering the Third World of clinicians rather than training British talent will disincentivise poor countries from investing in medical training, as the investment is a waste of limited resources if doctors simply leave for Western countries once qualified. However, new Home Secretary Sajid Javid does not appear to be changing course and is actually relaxing immigration controls to recruit more foreign medical personnel. At the same time, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is making it harder to remove doctors who kill their patients from the medical register at the same time, leading to concerns that the Government is facilitating a massive fall in standards.

Go look at a Trump product. Theyre all made in China.	ZTE is far from alone. China assembles some 90 percent of the world's smartphones, computers and other electronics. But most of the revenue flows to American companies that supply computer chips and other technology.

What Washington welcomes as a source of well-paid jobs, Chinese leaders consider a dangerous dependence.
Nearly 6 out of 10 believe that money and wealth should be more evenly distributed among a larger percentage of the people in the U.S.	“They’ve twisted American values,” she said in a follow-up phone interview. “A lot of them are anti-God, anti-religion and anti-military.”
In the survey, most say they are proud to be Americans, although Republicans feel that way more strongly (90 percent) than Democrats (61 percent).

There obviously must be judicial oversight of any more separations as required by law.

As we previously argued in Slate, the administration’s family separations were plainly unconstitutional. The district court agreed, at least for the purposes of a preliminary injunction.
This president went before the United Nations and castigated Israel for building settlements. He said nothing about thousands of rockets being rained in on Israel from the Gaza Strip.	Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon declined to comment. The village is located in the 60 percent of the West Bank known as Area C, which remains under exclusive Israeli control and is home to dozens of Israeli settlements. Israel places severe restrictions on Palestinian development in Area C, and home demolitions there are not unusual. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. As part of interim peace deals in the 1990s, the West Bank was carved up into autonomous and semi-autonomous Palestinian areas, known as Areas A and B, and Area C, which is home to some 400,000 Israeli settlers.

President Obama has the most border patrols and border security deployed at the border of any previous president.	If that happens there would be plenty of credit to go around. Certainly President Moon would deserve great credit for his unprecedented initiative in engaging the North. Certainly Kim Jong Un would deserve great credit for seeing that he could achieve his country’s security without nuclear weapons. And certainly Trump would deserve great credit for seeing the possibility of a peaceful solution where many of his advisers saw military action as the only option. In the meantime, we have much hard work ahead.
"Says as GOP was picking a convention city, I recommended Ohio."	Appearing in a state he dominated in 2016, Trump cast Tester as a "liberal Democrat," railing against his voting record on issues like abortion, immigration and taxes. While Tester opposed Trump's first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, and the Republican tax bill, he also took flak from the left for a bill easing the rules on banks. Tester tried to counter Trump's visit by taking out a full-page ad Thursday in more than a dozen newspapers across the state thanking him for signing 16 bills the Democrat sponsored or co-sponsored. Trump rallied in Great Falls to boost the candidacy of Tester's Republican challenger, state Auditor Matt Rosendale, who is seeking to deny Tester a third term and give Montana an all-Republican congressional delegation. The president has made the Montana race a priority as he hopes to help Republicans tighten the party's hold on the Senate.

"By spring 2014, parents of 60,000 students in New York state had refused to let them take the Common Core Tests."	Michigan lawmakers axed a requirement that would make prospective teachers take a basic skills test before earning their certification in Michigan. Rick Snyder signed legislation last week to get rid of the law requiring all prospective teachers to take the SAT to become certified in the state of Michigan, the Detroit Free Press reported. “The basic skills test … is not a strong indicator of how successful a teacher will be,” said Sen. Marty Knollenberg (R-Troy), one of the sponsors of the bipartisan-supported legislation. Knollenberg, who serves as the state Senate Education Committee chair, said the panel made its decision to make it easier for people to become teachers.
Congressman Perriello voted in lock step with Nancy Pelosi 90 percent of the time.	The list of Democrats expressing frustration with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has been growing longer in recent weeks, but don’t expect to see former President Barack Obama’s name on it. At a party fundraising event Friday afternoon in Northern California, Obama spoke highly of Pelosi – and even predicted that she will return to the job of House speaker after November’s midterm elections. “I think everybody knows how much I love Nancy Pelosi,” Obama told the gathering at a home in affluent Atherton, Politico reported. "Nancy, I believe, is one of the greatest speakers we ever had, and will once again be one of the greatest speakers we ever have after we get through this cycle," he continued. “And there's not much I could have gotten done without having Nancy there alongside of me every step of the way.”

"In (Sen. Marco) Rubios state of Florida alone, Social Security lifts more than -- count it -- a million people out of poverty."	The federal government provides about 80 percent of the state's Medicaid funds.

"But for immigrants, we would have a contracting population..."	Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.
The majority of the people that are coming to Arizona and trespassing are now becoming drug mules.	The illegal immigrants were accompanied by their “trail guide” who allegedly helped them march around the Falfurrias Border Patrol Checkpoint located about 80 miles from the Texas/Mexico border. Agents said another person in the vehicle is another illegal immigrant who joined the group during their march through the brush in Brooks County. Cartel connected human smugglers frequently force their human cargo to march through the very dangerous terrain in Brooks County. More than twenty percent of the deaths of illegal immigrants along the U.S. southwest border with Mexico occur in Brooks County, 80 miles from the border. Agents arrested the couple who were in the U.S. to allegedly seek asylum.

The cost-cutting measures included the introduction of a much less generous tiered-tariff and a cap on the number of hours eligible for subsidy. The cap was fixed at 400,000kwh - equivalent to a 99kw boiler running 11 hours a day, 365 days a year. Prior to the cap, 659 RHI boilers ran for longer than this. Since its introduction, that number has fallen to 118.
The United States is the leading nation in the world with the highest amount of doubt about the conventional wisdom of climate change.	Public support for abortion rights “remains as high as it has been in two decades of polling”, according to Pew Research, with 57% “saying abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 40% say it should be illegal in all or most cases”. “It’s clear that Donald Trump seeks to put forward a narrow-minded elitist who will protect corporations, the wealthy and the powerful, and individuals who will dismantle Roe, take away critical rights of LGBT Americans and eliminate healthcare for millions of people,” said Goldberg, referring to Roe v Wade, the 1973 decision protecting abortion rights. “All of these rights have been hard-won over decades, and it’s no exaggeration to say the right wants to put on the bench an individual that will turn the clock back.”

In rulings on issues such as workplace arbitration, sexual harassment, voting rights, consumer rights and civil rights, the court could have a particuilar impact on society’s most vulnerable. “I think the reality is that the court’s influence on everyday lives is felt most directly by those who tend to depend upon government, those who may not be in a socio-economic position to adequately vindicate their own rights without some government assistance,” said Vladeck.

WASHINGTON – If it's a holiday, it must be time for President Donald Trump to hit the golf course. Right on schedule, the presidential motorcade arrived at the Trump National Golf Club in suburban Virginia in the late morning, the middle of a day that also has the president tweeting and hosting a military-themed picnic later at the White House. As he departed the presidential mansion in the morning, Trump took to Twitter. In addition to a general salutation – "Happy Fourth of July....Our Country is doing GREAT!"
"Team Trump has accused Ted Cruz of fraud in Iowa, Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Kansas, Maine, Utah and Wisconsin."	"Jon's record is clear—if it's good for Montana, Jon works with anyone from either party to get things done. If it's bad for Montana, he'll stand up to anyone," Tester spokesman Chris Meagher said. "East Coast developer Matt Rosendale is only looking out for himself and whatever out-of-state special interest group that is propping up his campaign with cash. We can't trust him to defend Montana." But before Trump arrived in Montana, Tester's campaign took out full-page ads in newspapers across the state, highlighting bills the senator sponsored that Trump has signed into law.
"This years redistricting has been the most open, interactive and transparent redistricting process in Tennessee history."	He aligned himself with most of his Democratic colleagues against Gina Haspel, Trump's pick for CIA director, arguing that her record on enhanced interrogation techniques was unacceptable. And instead of focusing on a politically safe issue in his maiden Senate floor speech, Jones struck a nerve by calling for a dialogue on gun violence after the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida. In addition, during the campaign, Jones made no secret of his desire to protect LGBTQ rights and to support a woman's right to abortion. It's those kinds of positions that have made him a darling of Alabama's progressive minority — and somewhat of a public enemy among the state's conservative majority. Jones has introduced four pieces of legislation — none of any huge significance — since he arrived on Capitol Hill, including two agriculture bills, one that would expand access to capital for rural job creators and the last seeking to mandate an annual Medicaid expansion review.
"Under economic sanctions, now Iran is suffering 30 percent inflation, 20 percent unemployment."	Calls for an Iran without its current “dictatorial regime” were met with strengthened hope during the annual “free Iran” rally held in Paris this past weekend by the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), an exiled Paris-based Iranian opposition group allied with the Mujaheddin-e-Khalq (MEK). The rally, which event organizers said saw more than 100,000 attendees, took place at the Villepinte Congress Center, outside of Paris on Saturday. A series of panel discussions ranging in topic from women’s rights to denuclearization took place on Friday. The Guardian reported there was “a crowd of about 4,000, many of them refugees and young eastern Europeans who had been bussed in to attend the rally in return for a weekend trip to Paris.”
Distinguished speakers at Saturday’s event included former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal attorney; New Mexico’s former Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson; former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich; former Sen. Robert Torricelli (D-NJ); former FBI Director Louis Freeh; former Homeland Security Adviser Frances Townsend; and former U.S. Army chief of staff Gen. George Casey.
"Says that as Wisconsin governor, we ended welfare."	Tweeting Saturday from New Jersey, Trump urged ICE agents to "not worry or lose your spirit" and wrote that "the radical left Dems want you out. Next it will be all police." A number of prominent Democrats have called for the outright elimination of ICE. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York said ICE has "become a deportation force," telling CNN late Thursday "you should get rid of it, start over, reimagine it and build something that actually works." Rep. Mark Pocan, a Democrat from Wisconsin, stated last week that he plans to introduce legislation to eliminate ICE.
"In the 18th Congressional District, 100% of electric generation comes from coal."	“Sea levels have hardly risen and temperatures are still below those of the medieval warm period. Over time, temperature change seems to correlate rather more with sun spot activity than with carbon dioxide levels. “And even if carbon dioxide, a naturally occurring trace gas that’s necessary for life, really is the main climate change villain, Australia’s contribution to mankind’s emissions is scarcely more than 1%.”
Abbott framed his contribution not as a deliberate wrecking exercise but as an effort to “save” the government. “Far from wrecking the government, MPs worried about energy policy are trying to save it, with a policy that would be different from Labor’s and would give voters the affordable and reliable power they want.”
The folks in Washington are already forcing you to buy government health care.	"This document that has been so controversial and in many places reviled," Eberstadt says, "actually called the shots on what the future would look like better than any other single source I could think of." Revisionist views of the 1968 encyclical have even taken hold among some Catholics who have not abided by its teaching. "I eventually did read Humanae Vitae," says Jerry DeMers, "and actually I get the [pope's] point, the prediction he makes that if we practice contraception as a society, we will have a breakdown of the family. Because we have separated sex from marriage." U.S. Catholics however, show in their daily lives that the church's official prohibition of artificial birth control means little in practice, even if it has some value in theory.
Says President Barack Obama is the first president weve ever had who thinks he can choose which laws to enforce and which laws to ignore.	That has not been true of all past presidents. Andrew Jackson famously dismissed a court decision against his forced removal of the Cherokees from Georgia by saying: “The chief justice has made his ruling. Now let him enforce it.” As for today’s controversial immigration policies separating children from parents, they are, sadly, legal - a reminder that something may be immoral but not also illegal, and also a reminder that laws must be continually revised to reflect our highest societal moral standards. The Trump administration has also become adept at finding obscure, long dormant “national security” clauses in the federal codex to invoke as justification for steel and aluminum tariffs as well as punitive tariffs on Chinese goods (the latter has been announced but not yet enacted). These may be stupid policy, but they are not illegal - yet.
Up to 45 percent of illegal immigrants are not people that physically crossed the southern border or northern border. They are visa overstayers.	Even those who were fully clothed – many looking flamboyant – seemed to be in urgent need of help, aching to achieve a certain dream. He argued: 'If you lived in a world with no suffering, it will be an abnormality. That would make anyone miserable.' A few days before the trip, I had spoken to a group of young students enrolled in a mentorship programme at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. My friend who directs the scheme had told me that many students came in with suicidal thoughts, and about the difficulties of trying to help to prevent them from sliding into this pit.

On support for gay marriage.	Bishop John Bauerschmidt, who oversees the Middle Tennessee region of the church, stands firmly by his decision not to authorize their use, nor allow clergy within his diocese to officiate the religious ceremonies or permit the weddings on church property. In doing so, the bishop says he is being faithful to his job of guarding the discipline, faith and unity of the church. April 2017: Black female Episcopal bishop of Indy diocese breaks stained glass ceiling

"The teaching that Christian marriage is between a man and a woman is reasonable, traditional, and scriptural," Bauerschmidt said in an email. "There really is nothing remarkable about a Christian bishop who holds to this teaching." While Bishops can place limitations on the use of the marriage liturgies, they must refer couples to a willing diocese if they do not authorize them.
"This year, we have added an average of 200,000 jobs per month, a majority in the private sector, a stark contrast to the Bush Administration record of losing an average of nearly 750,000 jobs per month in its last three months."	The economy has added an average 207,000 jobs a month this year after a blowout number of 223,000 in May. Economists predict that 195,000 jobs were added in June. Unemployment stands at 3.8%, the lowest rate since 2000. If it dips to 3.7%, it will be the lowest since 1969.
Republicans in Congress refuse to list a single tax loophole they are willing to close.	We look at other parts of the world, where women are not allowed to vote, or dance, and we see ourselves as modern and liberated. But all our “freedoms” are fairly recent, from being able to get a mortgage to being protected from rape in marriage. The narrative of progress is one that too many liberals imbibe, but it is untrue. In many of the areas to which we turn when we measure gender equality, we have not moved forward for the past 10 years – income, political engagement, education.

She continued consulting on cybersecurity issues, becoming a senior fellow at The George Washington University’s Center for Cyber & Homeland Security, and working on reports and presentations on that issue and others for the World Economic Forum—the Swiss nonprofit that puts on an annual summit for global economic heavyweights in Davos, Switzerland. ***
While still running her own consulting firm in late 2016, Nielsen volunteered to advise the Trump transition team on homeland security policy. She met John Kelly during that time, and he tapped her to assist him—also as a volunteer—in his confirmation process for DHS secretary.
"Obama thinks the national anthem should be ""I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing."""	John Legend debuted his emotional new song titled “Preach” at the “Families Belong Together” rally in Los Angeles on Saturday after he warned the crowd of thousands to “resist the temptation to just disengage” from the fight to protect immigrants. Battling for immigrants is “not easy. It’s not a passive activity,” Legend said. “You may have to get your hands dirty. You can’t just talk about it or tweet about it.
"Right now, America has $1.1 trillion of student debt. Thats more than credit card debt."	Such challenges are a shot across the bow at the administration and DeVos, who is working to redefine a department conceived to advocate for students — not schools or lobbyists seeking financial profits. The debate carries huge significance for U.S. taxpayers, who fund the billions of dollars in student loans and grants DeVos oversees each year. “With Navient bulldozing students on their loans and the Department of Education gone missing in action, California is moving to stop the abuse,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra told NBC News in a statement. The California suit argues that Navient improperly steered financially distressed borrowers — such as single moms and new graduates — into forbearance, costing them thousands of dollars. It specifically targets federal loans that DeVos and Mick Mulvaney, acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, are tasked with policing.
Twenty-six men named William have been elected to statewide office and only seven women have had the honor.	According to a Russian state media report related by Turkey’s Hurriyet Daily News , the United States is planning to send next-generation B61 nuclear gravity bombs to NATO bases in several European countries, including Turkey. The bomb is said to be compatible with F-35 joint strike fighters, which Turkey is also due to receive amid some controversy. Hurriyet describes the B61 nuclear bomb and Russia’s sour reaction to the prospect of NATO bases receiving them:
The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) and the U.S. Air Force completed two non-nuclear system qualification flight tests of the B61-12 gravity bomb on June 9 at Tonopah Test Range in Nevada, according to a June 29 statement by DOE/NNSA. The test, which was reportedly the first of its kind, was aimed at extending the B61 bomb’s service life by adapting it to next generation aircraft, including B-2A Spirit Bomber. “The B61-12 LEP will consolidate and replace the existing B61 bomb variants in the [U.S.] nuclear stockpile.
When Obama took office the economy of the United States was actually shrinking for the first time in about 70 years.	In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners. Alas, he is wasting his time trying to shift the views of the Democratic Party, which has become ever more left-wing, if not outright socialist. I think it is time for Mr. James to become a Republican. Guy Randolph

Says Marco Rubio said that felons should not have their voting rights restored but that convicted felons should be allowed to own guns after they have done their time.	Most were in their twenties, and some were couples, but otherwise, they fit no single profile. Only a little information about their fate has trickled out from the secretive North Korean regime. The full explanation of why they were taken remains a mystery. The unexplained state-sponsored crime has shaped Japanese politics, with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe using the abductions to capitalize on anti-North Korean sentiment and advance his political career. Today, Megumi’s image is plastered on posters as the face of the issue, and her story has become a potent source of nationalism, frequently told in government-produced anime films and comic books.

I didnt inherit money from my parents.	The University of Missouri is still facing enrollment and budgetary problems, including a $49 million budget shortfall, as a result of the 2015 social justice protests that caught national media attention. Many people remember the high-pitched yell of former University of Missouri professor Melissa Click. Click found herself at the center of weeks of unrest at the University of Missouri in 2015 and 2016. Click rose to infamy after a video of her calling for a student photojournalist to be physically removed from campus simply because he was documenting the protests. The protests involved accusations by students that the administration had mishandled several alleged racial issues on campus.

You cant put a gun rack in a [Chevrolet] Volt.	No written authorisation was given for warrant officer’s ride in armed vehicle at Castlemartin range in Wales
Two soldiers were killed in an explosion in a tank on a British firing range after a warrant officer was given a “guest experience” ride in the armed vehicle, an inquest was told. No written authorisation had been given for the guest experience, a vital piece of equipment was not in place in the tank and charges were apparently not stowed correctly away, the inquest was told. Cpls Matthew Hatfield and Darren Neilson of the Royal Tank Regiment (RTR) died in the incident at Castlemartin range in Pembrokeshire in June last year. Their inquest was told that witnesses heard a hiss and saw smoke and flames coming from the turret of the Challenger 2 tank. Neilson, the tank commander, was seen climbing out from the turret and was thrown some distance by the force of the explosion.
The tax penalty that the government imposes if you dont buy health insurance is lower than it would have cost to buy insurance.	Kinner was being held without bail at the Ada County jail on 15 charges, including six of injury to a child and nine of aggravated battery, jail records showed. There was no lawyer listed for Kinner in the records. Kinner may have wanted to “extract vengeance” for being kicked out by a tenant who took him in, Police Chief Bill Bones said at a press conference on Sunday. The woman who took Kinner in was not harmed and was not at the residence at the time of the attack. Kinner assaulted the children at the party after he was unable to find the woman, police said, adding his motive was still under investigation.
Israel has seen a 90 percent reduction in terrorist attacks that it attributes to building a 500-mile fence.	Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon declined to comment. The village is located in the 60 percent of the West Bank known as Area C, which remains under exclusive Israeli control and is home to dozens of Israeli settlements. Israel places severe restrictions on Palestinian development in Area C, and home demolitions there are not unusual. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. As part of interim peace deals in the 1990s, the West Bank was carved up into autonomous and semi-autonomous Palestinian areas, known as Areas A and B, and Area C, which is home to some 400,000 Israeli settlers.

The National Science Foundation spent $1.2 million paying seniors to play World of Warcraft to study the impact it had on their brain.	The program, also known as a white hat operation, was part of a broader plan to get the company to treat disinformation campaigns by governments differently than it did more traditional problems such as spam, which is aimed at tricking individual users as opposed to shaping the political climate in an entire country, according to these people. Harvey said she had not heard of the operation. Some executives initially were reluctant to act aggressively against suspected fake accounts and raised questions about the legality of doing so, said the people familiar with internal company debates. In November, one frustrated engineer sought to illustrate the severity of the problem by buying thousands of fake followers for a Twitter manager, said two people familiar with the episode.

"If we choose Obamacare expansion, 600,000 will lose eligibility for their subsidies, of which 257,000 would be forced into Medicaid."	But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said. Tackett said he's concerned about children, especially in Eastern Kentucky, which has a higher rate of Medicaid patients and some of the state's worst oral health. "I have no problem with them regulating the adults that are on Medicaid," Tackett said. "If they are young and healthy, they should be out working or doing something.

California has seen a 56 percent decline in the gun murder rate since the 1990s.	Gun violence in Canada's largest city appears to be taking place at a higher rate than normal.

The two men killed on Saturday were identified as Jahvante Smart, 21, and Ernest Modekwe, 28, both of whom were from Toronto. Earlier on Saturday, a teenage boy was injured by gunfire around 4:30pm north of the city's downtown area.
Drug overdoses are now the second-most common cause of death in New Hampshire.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.

Small businesses hired workers at a slower pace in June, the second straight month of weakening job gains despite an overall healthy economy.

So far this year, small businesses have been creating on average 46,000 jobs a month. ADP reported that overall private employers added 177,00 jobs last month, a slight drop-off from the average this year of 202,667 a month as companies say they're having a tougher time finding skilled workers.

Meanwhile, other media personalities have faced kidnappings, arrests and physical abuse by mysterious hooded men who no journalist dare name - but every journalist in the country is convinced belong to the military intelligence agencies. But after maintaining months of silence as to what it has endured, or what exactly the military's complaints are, Dawn recently published a frank and stinging editorial. The editorial describes its important, factual reporting about the serious rift between civil and military authorities during the Nawaz Sharif government, which had infuriated the military, and Dawn's insistence on protecting the sources for its stories - a basic element of media ethics worldwide. The editorial states that "a campaign of disinformation, libel and slander, hate and virtual incitement to violence against Dawn and its staff has necessitated placing certain matters on record". It added that elements "within or sections of the state" are not upholding constitutional freedoms.

On releasing photographs depicting the abuse of prisoners.	Practice is only one of Deborah Glass’s 125 recommendations not accepted by Victorian government
Female prisoners in Victoria are still subject to “abusive” routine strip searches, a state government watchdog says. The Victorian ombudsman, Deborah Glass, said the government has failed to adopt a recommendation from her 2015 report into the prison system that called for an end to the searches. “Why has the government not accepted my recommendation to stop the abusive practice of routinely strip-searching women prisoners – in fact, the only recommendation out of 125 not accepted?” she asked on Wednesday. The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year.

The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force.

An Obama campaign tactic for rallying voters is to offer them cell phones.	Teddy Roosevelt hopped on whistle stop tour after whistle stop tour where he was able to drop into rural and suburban communities alike to deliver short, pre-packaged speeches that local papers would usually print verbatim. (He left them short on purpose for that very reason.) Franklin Roosevelt revolutionized and heightened the stature of the office with his fireside chats, that brought his message over the heads of the pesky press corps and directly into the living rooms of the American people. But, though it would have been seen as a scoop, even the reporters covering Lyndon B. Johnson had the good sense not to report on every turd he dropped in their presence. While the founders envisioned a government that moved slowly and methodically, today’s Wi-Fi-enabled political discourse is demanding the opposite.

Higher beer production and higher consumption go hand-in-hand.

Following the news of Mr. Pruitt’s resignation, Mr. Dinneen wrote that there was a “collective sigh of relief coming from the Midwest,” calling the 2019 ethanol quotas “the straw that broke the camel’s back.”
While it is too early to say how the handling of waivers or the treatment of E15 may change under new leadership, one indicator was small losses in affected refiners in early Friday trading and gains in most ethanol producers. CVR Refining, Andeavor and Delek U.S. Holdings , all of which benefited from waivers granted by the EPA, had rallied by 136%, 40% and 92% in the year ended Thursday, respectively. Ethanol companies Pacific Ethanol and Green Plains had fallen by 60% and 14%, respectively.

He is instead using his Twitter account to tout Democrats’ promises on healthcare, guns, gay status, and claims that President Donald Trump is tied to Russian President Vladimir Putin. On the Abolish ICE campaign, Schumer is instead calling for a “czar” to focus media attention on “reunifying families.” That topic polls better for Democrats than ending immigration enforcement.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

It’s not strictly true to say everyone is against the three huge plant-forested glass spheres at what Amazon calls its “campus” in the heart of the city. The Bezos balls, as the conservatories are popularly known, are modelled on the greenhouses at London’s Kew Gardens, feature walkways above fig trees, ferns and rhododendrons, and provide hot-desking for Amazon workers looking for a break from the neighbouring office tower.

"During the year Kagan barred military recruiters from Harvard Law School's Office of Career Services, ""military recruiting actually went up."""	Some immigrant U.S. Army reservists and recruits who enlisted in the military with a promised path to citizenship are being abruptly discharged, the Associated Press has learned. The AP was unable to quantify how many men and women who enlisted through the special recruitment program have been booted from the Army, but immigration attorneys say they know of more than 40 who have been discharged or whose status has become questionable, jeopardizing their futures. "It was my dream to serve in the military," said reservist Lucas Calixto, a Brazilian immigrant who filed a lawsuit against the Army last week. "Since this country has been so good to me, I thought it was the least I could do to give back to my adopted country and serve in the United States military." Some of the service members say they were not told why they were being discharged.
ISIS reaches about 100 million people a day through social media.	There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void. In New Jersey, this is compounded by the fact that the state is located between two big cities, New York and Philadelphia, that are in other states. The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.
Texas added more jobs in 2010 than any other state.	The services sector, where most Americans are employed, has now expanded for 101 consecutive months, or more than eight years. The gain was better than many economists had been expecting and depicts an overall economy that appears to be regaining momentum after a slowdown in the winter.

"(Brendan) Doherty wants to raise the eligibility age for Social Security benefits for anyone born after 1960, with no regard for the challenges it would cause for people working in physically demanding occupations."	Of the challenge, Freeman says: “I have a personal and family background in the health service, and I have nothing but admiration for every person who works in our NHS whatever their job is. There have always been challenges and demands on the NHS and that will continue. I will continue and build on the commitment and excellent work of Shona Robison, my predecessor. One of the successes of our health service is that people are living longer, and that puts different demands on it. So it is critical that we are, together, able to adapt and change to meet those demands.”

Debbie Jackow unlike her opponent ...WILL NOT de-fund the 20/20 land program.	Tweeting Saturday from New Jersey, Trump urged ICE agents to "not worry or lose your spirit" and wrote that "the radical left Dems want you out. Next it will be all police." A number of prominent Democrats have called for the outright elimination of ICE. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York said ICE has "become a deportation force," telling CNN late Thursday "you should get rid of it, start over, reimagine it and build something that actually works." Rep. Mark Pocan, a Democrat from Wisconsin, stated last week that he plans to introduce legislation to eliminate ICE.

Can rampant sand extraction be curbed? A win-win solution is the use of waste plastic in making concrete.
Says 99 percent of the time police officers arent charged when they kill young people of color.	These numbers are similar to those from a February Quinnipiac poll, where 49 percent of voters said Trump was racist and 46 percent said he was not. Forty-four percent of voters said they think “racist beliefs” were a motive in Trump’s immigration policy, while 50 percent said Trump has “a sincere interest in controlling our borders.” Sixty percent said the policy of separating children from their parents at the border was a violation of human rights. Since enacting the policy, Trump and his associates have repeatedly pushed false, racist narratives to garner support, often associating immigration with high crime rates despite no evidence to support claims that immigrants commit more crime than U.S. citizens. While only 11 percent of Republican voters in the Quinnipiac poll said they think Trump is a racist, 22 percent said they believe Trump has emboldened racist people to express their beliefs publicly. The number of hate crimes rose the year Trump was elected ― the first increase in over a decade.
Six justices on the U.S. Supreme Court have been confirmed in presidential election years since 1912.	Mexico's federal attorney general's office says Friday that accused drug lord Damaso Lopez has been extradited from the border city of Ciudad Juarez to the United States. Lopez is known by his alias "El Licenciado," a title for college graduates. He is facing U.S. charges of conspiring to distribute cocaine and commit money laundering and could face life imprisonment if convicted. Lopez was the right-hand man of drug kingpin Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman and helped him escape from a Mexican prison in 2001. Later, he battled Guzman's son for control of the Sinaloa cartel after the kingpin was captured in 2016.
Property taxes are now 18% higher than when(Mark Sharpe)first took office.	Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.

He had made a complaint to the inspector general of intelligence and security, and was given permission to disclose the operation, Collaery said. Collaery has been charged with communicating the information to ABC journalists. He was, at the time, acting for Timor-Leste in a dispute over the bugging operation at the permanent court of arbitration in The Hague.

Nearly 600 more retail jobs are to go in the UK as the Jacques Vert, Windsmoor and Precis department store brands are wound down by administrators. Administrators said they had failed to find a buyer for Calvetron Brands, which had been restructured following a rescue deal last summer. The business entered administration in May and had already shed more than 400 jobs before Wednesday’s announcement. The latest retail job losses come as more than 30,000 jobs are at risk in the UK following mass closure announcements by major chains including House of Fraser, New Look and Marks & Spencer. Retailers are suffering from rising costs and the switch to online shopping just as hard-pressed consumers rein in spending.

Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.

LOUIE! Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, says it’s possible that staff for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein are monitoring his actions. ‘I’ve been told in the past there’s been great concern about who I saw, what I did and that I was being monitored and was even told they know everybody that walks in your office,’ Gohmert said Monday in an interview on Fox Business’s ‘Lou Dobbs Tonight.’” (via Washington Examiner).
"The United States is about 100th in voter turnout among the industrialized nations, and Texas is near the bottom in terms of voter registration and voter turnout."	"The president of the republic and his government will be absolutely respectful and support the authorities that are elected," Pena Nieto told reporters. Hovering over the election is the specter of vote fraud, though electoral officials deny it is a possibility with the modern balloting technology and institutions now in place. In both of Lopez Obrador's previous two presidential losses he alleged fraud. In his first loss — by a mere 0.56 percent to conservative Felipe Calderon in 2006 — his supporters held months-long protests in Mexico City and he referred to himself as "the legitimate president." His allies are warning even before Sunday's presidential vote that there better not be any funny business.

Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.
"In 2011, NJ economy ranked 47th--at the bottom with Alabama, Mississippi Wyoming. Under Christie, NJ is falling behind."	Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
"Theres never been a (U.S. Supreme Court) vacancy in the last, I think, 30 years, lasting longer than 237 days."	Republican Sen. Susan Collins, a critical vote on whomever President Trump nominates to replace Justice Kennedy on the Supreme Court, said any nominee who would overturn Roe v. Wade would "not be acceptable."

Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb.

"Over 80 percent of our trade deficit today is with countries that are not trade agreement partners, that are not level playing fields for the United States."	When someone walks up and says how much do we lose with this country? We’re going to make it reciprocal.

Says Ken Cuccinelli wants to eliminate all forms of birth control.	"Unlike our forerunners in 1968, those of us living today have access to something they didn't," said Mary Eberstadt, a widely published Catholic writer, "50 years of sociological, psychological, medical, and other evidence about the revolution's fallout." Some of the lines in Humanae Vitae, when stripped of mid-20th century cultural references, find echoes in contemporary concerns about nonconsensual sexual relations. "A man who grows accustomed to the use of contraceptive methods may forget the reverence due to a woman," the pope wrote, "... and reduce her to a mere instrument of his own desires." "This document that has been so controversial and in many places reviled," Eberstadt says, "actually called the shots on what the future would look like better than any other single source I could think of." Revisionist views of the 1968 encyclical have even taken hold among some Catholics who have not abided by its teaching.
A bill that would halt the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases would help stop rising gas prices.	— MINING: The EPA said last year that it won't require mining companies to prove they have the financial resources to clean up pollution, an Obama-era rule stemming from a long history of pollution spilling from abandoned mines into streams. Pruitt said modern mining practices and existing regulations made the financial requirement unnecessary and a burden on mining. — AUTOS: Pruitt's EPA has proposed freezing vehicle fuel-efficiency standards at 2020 levels for the next five years, according to a draft of the proposal obtained by Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del. For new vehicles, that means an average of about 30 miles per gallon instead of rising to 36 mpg by 2025 as Obama's EPA proposed. — OIL AND GAS: More than a dozen states are suing the EPA for failing to take action against leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, from oil and natural gas wells.
"The measles vaccine has killed 108 people in the last decade, while no one has died of measles."	In 2014, as part of a training program initiated by the United State's Global Health Security Agenda the labs at the Manipal Center for Virus Research and the National Institute of Virology in Pune were prepared to identify outbreaks of Nipah. "That training really helped us," says Arunkumar. "I ruled out other causes of encephalitis and suspected it was Nipah right away." On the evening of May 18, less than 12 hours after he received the patient's tissue samples, his lab confirmed his suspicion. The very next day, M. Miriyam, the boy's aunt, died.
"For our next two years in my state, we will end with a structural surplus of $499 million."	That came on the heels of 0.9 percent drop in March, the first monthly drop since July of 2017. Total private construction rose 0.3 percent, with residential projects up 0.8 percent in May. New single-family home construction rose 0.6 percent and the volatile apartment building sector jumped 1.6 percent. Private, non-residential building fell 0.3 percent. Economists are forecasting that construction spending will contribute to overall growth this year even though interest rates are rising.
In Virginia there has been a billion dollars in surplus over the last three years. The legislature has spent less than 1 percent of that on roads.

Analysts say tariffs are not the most effective way of putting pressure on China, which the US accuses of unfair trade practices and stealing intellectual property from US companies. Syracuse University economics professor Mary Lovely and researcher Yang Liang found 87% of electronics products to be levied by US tariffs came from multinationals and joint ventures rather than Chinese firms. China’s economy is no longer as dependent on exports. Domestic consumption now accounts for more than half of the country’s GDP. Exports to the US account for only 19% of all of China’s exports.

A Texas mother claims her son was attacked at a Whataburger in San Antonio because he was wearing a Trump-supporting MAGA hat. The mother posted a video of the incident on Facebook. The woman claimed a man became angry at her teenage son and his group of friends because one of them wore a “Make American Great Again” hat in support of President Donald Trump, KENS5 reported. The video shows the man throwing his fountain drink at the table and shouting a racial slur. In her post on Facebook, that has since been taken down, Patricia Spittler asks for help in identifying the man she called “scum bag of the year,” the San Antonio CBS affiliate reported.
"Says that during President Barack Obamas tenure, the United States has created 15 million new jobs."	In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions.

President Barack Obama ordered our military to enlist illegal aliens.	It was President Obama who left his party in this position. His anti-business agenda was unpopular, but was never revisited. Democrats’ losses over the past decade stemmed in large part from a slow-growth economy that never gained momentum. Even though he received what he called a “shellacking” in the 2010 midterms, and even though the GOP made unprecedented political gains during his tenure, President Obama was always convinced the country was behind him. As Mara Liasson wrote for NPR in 2016: “During Obama's eight years in office, the Democrats have lost more House, Senate, state legislative and governors seats than under any other president.” She noted that the Obama legacy includes “one huge failure: a diminished Democratic Party.”
In 2013, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., invoked the so-called “nuclear option,” discarding traditional filibuster protections for the minority party in favor of requiring only a simple majority to approve judicial and executive branch nominees.
"A government panel that didn't include cancer specialists says women shouldn't receive mammograms until age 50...If government takes over health care, recommendations like these could become the law for all kinds of diseases."	Although most women are accustomed to having pap smears to test for cervical cancer -- a disease that strikes 12,000 American women each year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- a new study found pap smear alone might not be the most effective way to catch the often-preventable cancer before it progresses. Most cervical cancers are caused by a particular strains of the Human papillomavirus, or HPV. The test for detecting HPV test is simpler than a pap smear and, the study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found, it may be better at catching the earliest cervical cancer stages. Pap smears involve scraping cells from the cervix and examining them for cancerous changes, also known as "cytology" testing. They find only 55.4 percent of suspected cancer cases, according to a study by the Canadian Cervical Cancer Screening Trial Study Group, and requires a special process using a liquid medium that takes several days.
"This governor has cut funding repeatedly for people who have AIDS, who need drugs to save their life."	This is just terrible timing all around." Medicaid, an $11 billion, state-federal health plan in Kentucky, covers 1.4 million people, about 600,000 of them children. The federal government provides about 80 percent of the state's Medicaid funds. The cuts to dental and vision benefits were supposed to affect only able-bodied adults, mostly those added to Medicaid under an expansion authorized through the Affordable Care Act.
"We have dozens of districts that go for 150 to 200 miles, splitting counties, splintering cities and connecting areas that have very little in common."	'We’re going to run different'
His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
Congress gave an unelected board the power to deny care to seniors.	"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.
I never said I was on the Falkland Islands.	Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. LONDON — Over the past century American and British troops have fought side-by-side in two World Wars, Korea and the conflicts in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan. But some lawmakers and experts in the United Kingdom are warning that the British military could soon be seen as irrelevant by the United States unless it receives a colossal funding boost. "There is a concern that the U.K. is falling ever further behind and becoming even more useless from a U.S. point of view," said Andrew Dorman, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a think tank in London.

The latest Quinnipiac poll found that nearly six-in-ten Americans oppose ObamaCare -- 30% support the law and 57% oppose it.	“They’ve twisted American values,” she said in a follow-up phone interview. “A lot of them are anti-God, anti-religion and anti-military.”
In the survey, most say they are proud to be Americans, although Republicans feel that way more strongly (90 percent) than Democrats (61 percent). There is no consensus when asked about the country’s current course, though: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. “Overwhelming majorities of those in both parties and independents agree that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.”” USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll
The USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll of 1,004 adults, taken online June 26-27, has a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The survey is one of a year-long series on American values.
Says Wisconsin Senate recall candidate Jessica King voted to increase her pay with taxpayer dollars by 63 percent.	Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.
Says Barack Obama began his presidency with an apology tour.	Ethiopia's government has fired five prison officials as it confronts allegations of torture and other abuses of inmates as part of a wave of reforms. Among those fired is the federal prison chief who until recently defended the treatment of inmates as "fair." The firings came ahead of a new Human Rights Watch report released Thursday that documents widespread arbitrary detention, torture, rape and humiliation over several years in Ethiopia's eastern Somali region. It urges new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to investigate the "horrific" situation. Abiy has admitted that security forces have tortured people but has yet to "tackle Ethiopia's culture of impunity and ensure accountability," said Felix Horne, senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch.

Nielsen founded her own consulting firm, called Sunesis Consulting; she brought on a Bush administration colleague, Elizabeth Neumann, as managing partner, and eventually expanded the suburban Washington firm to 15 people. She continued consulting on cybersecurity issues, becoming a senior fellow at The George Washington University’s Center for Cyber & Homeland Security, and working on reports and presentations on that issue and others for the World Economic Forum—the Swiss nonprofit that puts on an annual summit for global economic heavyweights in Davos, Switzerland. ***
While still running her own consulting firm in late 2016, Nielsen volunteered to advise the Trump transition team on homeland security policy. She met John Kelly during that time, and he tapped her to assist him—also as a volunteer—in his confirmation process for DHS secretary.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.

"When it comes to classified information at the State Department, Hillary Clintons the decider."	The report also said that Strzok repeatedly pushed for more aggressive action in the Clinton probe. "The conduct by these employees cast a cloud over the entire FBI investigation and sowed doubt about the FBI’s work," the report concluded. "The damage caused by these employees’ actions extends far beyond the scope of the (Clinton) investigation and goes to the heart of the FBI’s reputation for neutral fact finding and political independence." Goelman, in an op-ed in USA TODAY last month, said Strzok has become the victim of "political gamesmanship" by Congress and President Trump, who has repeatedly tweeted about Strzok as evidence of bias by the FBI and Justice Department. "They have spent months cynically taking these texts out of context and saying that one- or two-word snippets somehow prove that the FBI investigations of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the Russia probe itself, were biased," Goelman wrote.

Hollywood and China have seen their relationship shift to a new model, analysts said, with major players such as Joe and Anthony Russo — the brother duo known for directing "Captain America" — setting up shop in China.

Within China, the state-backed film industry has clear markings of Hollywood influence.

General Motors is one of the latest to weigh in on the threat of new tariffs targeting foreign autos and automotive parts, warning that GM could be forced to scale back production and cut U.S. jobs. GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra, who briefly served on President Donald Trump’s economic advisory council before it was disbanded last year, is the latest to come out against tariffs that could run as high as 25 percent. Harley-Davidson has already announced plans to move some production abroad, while BMW has said it would likely cut back operations at its Spartanburg, South Carolina plant that is currently the largest exporter of American-made automobiles.

Spent years playing various roles on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, which oversees the EPA, drafting regulations on chemical safety, air and water pollution and climate change — generally seeking to reduce government regulations on industries that generate greenhouse gases. Served as longtime aide to Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., whom you may recall from the 2015 floor speech in which he rebutted climate change science with a snowball. After leaving Congress, worked for years as a lobbyist for some of the largest coal, chemical and uranium companies in the U.S. — including the uranium mining firm that pushed for the reduction of Bears Ears National Monument, which is near one of its processing facilities.

Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
State Department officials actually directed contracts for the Haitian recovery after the earthquake to friends of the Clintons.	NEW YORK — House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) has referred 15 individuals, including longtime Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal, for possible “open setting” testimony in the ongoing Russia investigation. The list was sent to House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA). Many of the names are tied to the discredited anti-Trump dossier produced by the controversial Fusion GPS firm, which was paid for its dossier work by both Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) via the Perkins Coie lawfirm. Indeed, Perkins Coie attorney Marc E. Elias, who reportedly was involved in arranging the payments that resulted in the dossier, made the Nunes list. As did Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson.

Our Founding Fathers resolved that without freedom Americans could not enjoy life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. To secure it, they fought a war to break free from the bonds of tyranny. It isn’t a faraway tyrant that oppresses us today. Rather, we are in the grip of a new kind of tyranny — that of mistrust. This tyrant sits on a throne in our minds and is just as cruel as King George was during the time of the Founders.
Freshman Rep. Bob Gibbs is spending his one year anniversary on vacation only working 6 days in all of January.	According to a Russian state media report related by Turkey’s Hurriyet Daily News , the United States is planning to send next-generation B61 nuclear gravity bombs to NATO bases in several European countries, including Turkey. The bomb is said to be compatible with F-35 joint strike fighters, which Turkey is also due to receive amid some controversy. Hurriyet describes the B61 nuclear bomb and Russia’s sour reaction to the prospect of NATO bases receiving them:
The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) and the U.S. Air Force completed two non-nuclear system qualification flight tests of the B61-12 gravity bomb on June 9 at Tonopah Test Range in Nevada, according to a June 29 statement by DOE/NNSA. The test, which was reportedly the first of its kind, was aimed at extending the B61 bomb’s service life by adapting it to next generation aircraft, including B-2A Spirit Bomber. “The B61-12 LEP will consolidate and replace the existing B61 bomb variants in the [U.S.] nuclear stockpile.

XI ASSERTS TERRITORIAL CLAIMS IN MEETING WITH US DEFENSE SECRETARY
Chinese President Xi Jinping strongly asserted China's determination to defend territory it claims, including in the South China Sea, in a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. While the tone of Mattis' visit to Beijing was largely upbeat, Xi made sure to reinforce his reputation as a fervent nationalist when it comes to issues of sovereignty. Though Xi gave no specifics in his statement, he was largely seen as indicating the South China Sea as well as self-governing Taiwan. China also claims territory held by India and uninhabited East China Sea islands controlled by Japan.
Says Obama flip-flopped on banning handguns.	— MINING: The EPA said last year that it won't require mining companies to prove they have the financial resources to clean up pollution, an Obama-era rule stemming from a long history of pollution spilling from abandoned mines into streams. Pruitt said modern mining practices and existing regulations made the financial requirement unnecessary and a burden on mining. — AUTOS: Pruitt's EPA has proposed freezing vehicle fuel-efficiency standards at 2020 levels for the next five years, according to a draft of the proposal obtained by Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del. For new vehicles, that means an average of about 30 miles per gallon instead of rising to 36 mpg by 2025 as Obama's EPA proposed. — OIL AND GAS: More than a dozen states are suing the EPA for failing to take action against leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, from oil and natural gas wells.

President Donald Trump should give Mexico’s next president the benefit of the doubt — if nothing else because they’re largely alike.
[T]he Georgia Dome has returned $10 billion in economic impact to the state of Georgia.	There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void. In New Jersey, this is compounded by the fact that the state is located between two big cities, New York and Philadelphia, that are in other states. The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.
What happens is people like Warren Buffett and he says this himself...pay 15 percent on the millions of dollars that they earn from wealth income... while their secretary is paying a higher rate on her work income. It's not right.	This was particularly an issue for Pruitt’s former executive scheduler Sydney Hupp, who often had to shell out for Pruitt’s trips. Hupp was also asked by Pruitt to speak with staff at one of Trump’s hotels, believing he could get a deal on a second-hand mattress they were selling. Pruitt remained miserly even when he was abusing his position to get a good deal. He fell behind on the rental payments on the condo he was getting on the cheap and eventually had to be evicted and the locks were changed.
"Other Western countries have ended their ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policies."	The government will appoint a national LGBT health adviser and take measures to end so-called conversion therapy as part of a plan to deliver what Theresa May has promised will be “real and lasting change”. The proposals form part of an action plan published by the Equalities Office on Tuesday. It follows a UK-wide survey of LGBT people that had more than 108,000 responses, billed as the largest study of its kind. The 30-page plan contains a series of pledges, including to improve the police response to LGBT hate incidents, more support for LGBT students and teachers and improvements to gender identity services for transgender adults. The proposals, which will receive an initial £4.5m in funding, were welcomed by the campaign groups Stonewall and the LGBT Foundation.
The U.S. is borrowing approximately $2.52 for every $1 of economic growth so far in 2012.	As well as a new president, Mexican will be voting for 128 senators and 500 deputies in Congress as well as state and local officials. In all, 88 million people will be eligible to vote. Mexico is the second largest economy in Latin America and a major oil exporter. However, oil prices have dropped and the Mexican currency, the peso, has fallen sharply against the dollar. More than 40% of the population lives in poverty and high levels of corruption and violence have led some companies to pull out of the worst affected areas.
"The Northwest Corridor highway project in Cobb and Cherokee counties is expected to create over 9,700 jobs statewide."	The concrete inside the tunnels has been eroding since Superstorm Sandy flooded them with millions of gallons of brackish water in 2012, and the 12,000-volt copper electric cables inside the concrete periodically short-circuit and melt down. “It’s like a volcano erupting,” said Mike Siwiec, an Amtrak electrical specialist who showed me the frayed remains of a cable that ruptured and gridlocked the city in 2015. Meanwhile, the rickety Portal Bridge fails to close properly one of every seven times it opens, though maintenance crews can sometimes bash it back into alignment with a sledgehammer. The 9-mile stretch between Newark and New York City is now a chokepoint for the entire Northeast Corridor; whenever one of its two tunnels goes out of service, train traffic decreases 75 percent, and whenever the Portal Bridge can’t close, train traffic halts completely. It’s hard to calculate the precise economic impact of losing a key entryway to a city that accounts for 10 percent of U.S. GDP, but Gateway’s boosters peg it at $100 million a day.
The presidents own advisers have said theres a war on coal.	That leaves the broader theory that Deutsche Bank’s loans to Trump were somehow illicit. Yet this, too, doesn’t add up. How would the White House leverage that information against Anthony Kennedy? Trump would have to threaten to reveal it to the public—but that would incriminate him, too.

"Because of the new health care law, 17 million kids can no longer be denied for a pre-existing condition."	"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.

Mitofsky predicted Morena allies would take between 56 and 70 seats in the 128-member Senate and between 256 and 291 spots in the 500-seat lower house. "The anger that the average Mexican feels toward the way things are being governed has favored Lopez Obrador," said Shannon O'Neil, senior fellow for Latin America Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.

Not surprisingly, the split was along partisan lines: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now.

China Mobile has reportedly been censoring content banned by the Chinese government’s “great firewall,” even when Chinese citizens are in the United States — prompting the FCC to debate its license. According to the Washington Post, on Monday, the U.S. Department of Commerce “recommended the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) deny a license to China Mobile, the state-run company that is the world’s largest phone network by subscribers.”
“The Commerce Department suggested the move because of the national security risk China Mobile poses,” they explained, adding that China Mobile is an “arm of the Chinese state,” and that “those with China Mobile as their carrier are often unable to access American websites and apps that are banned in China.”
One Chinese journalist was reportedly unable to access Facebook, the New York Times, and Google Maps from their phone while in the United States. Another user, Shanghai analyst May Sun, warned that the “Great Firewall” doesn’t stop when you enter the United States as a Chinese citizen. “[It] is exactly the same as when you surf on the Internet at home,” May Sun declared. “You still don’t have access to what is blocked by the Great Firewall.”
In a statement, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) called China Mobile an “unacceptable risk.”
“Granting the authorization poses an unacceptable risk to U.S. national security and law enforcement,” NTIA proclaimed.

Wisconsin is not walking away from a dime in federal funds by rejecting the Obamacare Medicaid expansion.	Nebraska May Join Utah, Idaho in Putting Medicaid Expansion Before Voters

Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.

He said many of the people he has talked to were either traveling or away for work when the blaze started Thursday and have not been able to find out the status of their homes. Authorities in Oregon are urging hikers and other outdoors enthusiasts to avoid forested areas near the Oregon-California border, where a blaze has killed one person. The Jackson County Sheriff's Office said Friday that although the blaze has not crossed into Oregon, officials are concerned people in remote areas could be unreachable in case they need to quickly evacuate. It says the areas of concern include the Pacific Crest Trail, Mount Ashland and the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument.

Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement announcement has set off a political tempest as the question of his successor is considered. Among those reported to be among the top of President Donald Trump’s short list is Judge Brett Kavanaugh on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The prospect of a Justice Kavanaugh worries some consumer advocates, who say he has taken an activist position against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the regulator implemented in the wake of the Great Recession in the hopes of thwarting future financial meltdowns.

Over the fireplace at Mingo Creek Craft Distillers, a whiskey purveyor in the small town of Washington, Pennsylvania, a portrait of Alexander Hamilton hangs upside down. With snowy hair and a black velvet jacket, Hamilton wears an impassive look that might be described as hauteur. In 1791, to pay off debts the newly formed United States incurred during the revolutionary war, Hamilton imposed the first federal tax on the people of the region. By taxing their most lucrative product, whiskey, he became what he is here today: a villain representing the excesses of the federal government. The town of Washington is only a six-hour drive from Manhattan, but it’s a world away from the Broadway stage where Hamilton, clad in snug white knickers, enjoys a better reputation.

Certain landlords require 12 months’ rent up front, even three years’ worth of audited accounts, when precarious workers can’t afford upwards of £400 for an accountant. Character references for guarantors have been mandated, along with insisting that even “elderly” renters (ie those over 75), provide guarantors. Older tenants are increasingly reliant on the private sector, and unlikely to have parents or employers to ask (although with extended working lives, maybe that will change).

In addition, during the campaign, Jones made no secret of his desire to protect LGBTQ rights and to support a woman's right to abortion. It's those kinds of positions that have made him a darling of Alabama's progressive minority — and somewhat of a public enemy among the state's conservative majority. Jones has introduced four pieces of legislation — none of any huge significance — since he arrived on Capitol Hill, including two agriculture bills, one that would expand access to capital for rural job creators and the last seeking to mandate an annual Medicaid expansion review.
Ch Guevara wrote extensively about the superiority of white Europeans over people of African descent.	The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) spent a total of $4 billion on improper food stamp payments to those receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the USDA confirmed with Breitbart News on Friday. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service announced this week that improper payments made up 6.3 percent of SNAP money in the fiscal year (FY) 2017—the latest data available from the agency. Breitbart News analyzed the USDA’s data on food stamp spending and found that $4,007,026,532 of the $63,603,595,754 the agency spent on SNAP in FY 2017 went to improper payments. The USDA told Breitbart News that “it is important to note that improper payments include both overpayments and underpayments,” meaning that households on SNAP that received less than what they were supposed to receive for the month are also included in the percentage rate. Brandon Lipps, the Acting Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services at the agency, said that most improper payments are due to “human errors”—either because of state agencies miscalculating benefits or benefit recipients giving state agencies the wrong information.

Shortly after Halili’s assassination, Duterte told reporters, “I don’t know who killed him, but I told you don’t [engage in illegal drugs]. … His procession of drug suspects was just a front.”
Prior to this accusation, however, Halili had established a “walk of shame” program where he paraded drug suspects around his city for the public to jeer, leading others in the government to suggest he was killed by drug traffickers in revenge for humiliating their peers.

For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.

"People who use opioids, including heroin, were up to 13 times more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system," says Winkelman. The study shows the complexity of the the opioid crisis, according to Josiah Rich, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Brown University, who wasn't involved in the research. It shows "the spectrum of the disease and its overlap with the criminal justice system, showing that the more you progress along that continuum, the more likely you are to get tangled up in the criminal justice system." The study also showed that most people with opioid use disorder had other mental illnesses and were also more likely to have certain chronic health conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The study authors argue for the need to engage and involve the criminal justice system in dealing with the opioid epidemic, including reducing overdose deaths.

Jeff Burke, APS director of resources planning, says customers would see 6 to 14 percent per year increases on their bills if the company is forced to ratchet up renewable use ahead of schedule. "We continue to add renewables to our system, but they have to make sense," Burke said. "It's not really about a target, it's about what makes sense for our customers' usage and what makes rates affordable and what keeps our system reliable." Thirty-two states with renewable standards didn't have, on average, a correlated rate increase, according to Wesley Hersche, an associate director of research with Arizona State University's Global Security Initiative. "These issues involve a complex interaction of factors, and we should be careful not to oversimplify things," Hersche wrote in April.
"Once people become citizens under the DREAM Act and turn 21, they can sponsor their illegal immigrant parents for legalization."	For example, Hannah Dreier reported of a case in which parents remained jailed at the border while their 9-year-old was deported back to Mexico alone and put into foster care. Reuniting those families will require coordinating with Mexican authorities, something the Trump administration is unlikely to do unless pushed. Moreover, the judge has left a potential loophole, allowing for separations to continue if there has been a “determination that the parent is unfit or poses a danger to the child.” While this is in accordance with dependency law—the law governing the removal of children from their parents—there are not yet any judicial checks in place to ensure that any administrative determinations of “unfitness” or “danger” to the child do not continue to be unlawful and arbitrary. The law in this area is clear. As Judge Sabraw—a George W. Bush appointee—noted, due process, including a reasonable hearing on parental fitness, is required before the government can interfere with a parent’s right to raise his or her own child.
Says Wisconsin Manufacturers Commerces own 2014 survey revealed that just 15 percent of business executive respondents were in favor of Right-To-Work legislation.	It was no surprise to read that the very first lesson you suggest could be learned from overseas (Five things the NHS could do to improve service, 3 July) is the establishment of integrated health and social care, as has happened in New Zealand. The achievements of the Attlee government are at the heart of my socialist beliefs but the compromises which led then to the split between free NHS care and means-tested social care remain the achilles heel as the NHS celebrates 70 years. It is utterly ludicrous to have separate systems which imply distinct and neat boundaries between health and care, with rather a lot of people making a good living arguing on which side of the fence some poor demented soul belongs. Disputes around the funding of continuing care have become a major industry. The recent NHS funding announcement, making no reference whatsoever to social care, evidenced the fact that the government still hasn’t the least idea of how the two are umbilically linked.
The Capitol Police force is going so far as to use paramilitary equipment in dealing with singing protesters in Madison	PORTLAND, Ore. -- Two opposing protest groups -- Patriot Prayer and antifa -- clashed in downtown Portland Saturday, CBS Portland affiliate KOIN reports. Portland police said failure to leave the area could leave to arrests, calling the demonstration a riot. More than 100 members of Patriot Prayer group gathered at Terry Schrunk Plaza for a "freedom rally," while more than 100 counter protesters with an antifa group gathered across the street at Chapman Square for rallies before a march. Police revoked Patriot Prayer's permit for the rally after the two groups began to clash. People were lighting firecrackers and smoke bombs in the crowd while police used flash bangs in an effort to disperse the clashing protesters.

Says Democratic runoff opponent Grady Yarbrough twice previously ran statewide as a Republican.	The first, Antonio Halili, was the mayor of the much larger Tanauan City, south of Manila. Unlike Bote, Halili had developed both a reputation for having a heavy hand against drug traffickers and negotiating with them. Halili appeared on a more recent Duterte list of elected officials with ties to drug trafficking in 2017. Shortly after Halili’s assassination, Duterte told reporters, “I don’t know who killed him, but I told you don’t [engage in illegal drugs]. … His procession of drug suspects was just a front.”
Prior to this accusation, however, Halili had established a “walk of shame” program where he paraded drug suspects around his city for the public to jeer, leading others in the government to suggest he was killed by drug traffickers in revenge for humiliating their peers.

While other data on Thursday showed private payrolls rising less than expected last month and a surprise increase in new applications for unemployment benefits last week, overall labor market conditions continue to tighten. The labor market is considered to be near or at full employment, with the jobless rate at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent. The unemployment rate has dropped by three-tenths of a percentage point this year and is near the Federal Reserve’s forecast of 3.6 percent by the end of this year.

'THIS IS YOUR RECEIPT': Jarrod W. Ramos, the man suspected of killing five people during an attack on the Capital Gazette newspaper last week in Annapolis, Maryland, sent multiple threatening letters prior to the shooting, police revealed on Monday ... The paper’s former attorney gave police mail he received at his law office on Monday, the newspaper's former publisher Thomas Marquardt told The Baltimore Sun. One of those documents, dated June 28 – the same day as the shooting – allegedly included a letter from Ramos in which he said he was en route to the paper “with the objective of killing every person present.”
The letter was written in the form of a “Motion for Reconsideration” by a Maryland court following a 2016 refusal to hear Ramos’ defamation case that he had filed against the outlet. That stemmed from a 2011 column published in the paper about a criminal harassment charge against Ramos that was filed by a former high school classmate. “You were too cowardly to confront those lies, and this is your receipt,” he allegedly wrote.

Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.

However Yad Vashem said this contradicted decades of historical research and contained "grave errors and deceptions". It said much of the Polish resistance in its various movements "not only failed to help Jews, but was also not infrequently actively involved in persecuting them". Polish assistance to Jews during the Holocaust was "relatively rare", Yad Vashem said, and "attacks against and even the murder of Jews were widespread".

"A man who grows accustomed to the use of contraceptive methods may forget the reverence due to a woman," the pope wrote, "... and reduce her to a mere instrument of his own desires." "This document that has been so controversial and in many places reviled," Eberstadt says, "actually called the shots on what the future would look like better than any other single source I could think of." Revisionist views of the 1968 encyclical have even taken hold among some Catholics who have not abided by its teaching.

Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.
"An economic impact study found that for every $1 invested in pre-K in Pennsylvania, a total of $1.79 is generated in total spending within the state."	There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void. In New Jersey, this is compounded by the fact that the state is located between two big cities, New York and Philadelphia, that are in other states. The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.
"Last year it was discovered that Rhode Islands public employees ranked 4th in average pay, while the private sector ranked 23rd."	Amazon has long been accused of stretching the city’s transit and education systems, and its highly paid workers have driven up prices of goods and housing. The resentful murmur recently became a roar after Amazon reacted to the city’s latest tax proposal, which would have charged large businesses an annual $275 per employee, by resorting to what critics call blackmail. In mid-June, less than a month after unanimously passing the tax, Seattle’s council abandoned it in the face of threats from the corporation. The tension has sharpened the debate about whether the city can retain its identity as one of the most progressive in the country, or is destined to be just another tech hub. Ironically, given Amazon’s much-publicised “city sweepstakes”, in which municipalities in North America are competing to land the company’s second headquarters, Seattle did not reach a Faustian pact with Amazon to lure it in the first place.

The latest retail job losses come as more than 30,000 jobs are at risk in the UK following mass closure announcements by major chains including House of Fraser, New Look and Marks & Spencer. Retailers are suffering from rising costs and the switch to online shopping just as hard-pressed consumers rein in spending.

In rulings on issues such as workplace arbitration, sexual harassment, voting rights, consumer rights and civil rights, the court could have a particuilar impact on society’s most vulnerable. “I think the reality is that the court’s influence on everyday lives is felt most directly by those who tend to depend upon government, those who may not be in a socio-economic position to adequately vindicate their own rights without some government assistance,” said Vladeck.
"Says Bernie Sanders health care plan would empower Republicangovernors to take away Medicaid,to take away health insurance for low-income and middle-income working Americans."	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.
In Chile they have 72 percent of the GDP in savings.	Universities deploying obstetricians to the region are focusing on an Odate hospital partly because there were too few pregnancies in Kazuno. “Childbirth is the very foundation of any region. This could become the primary factor to push Kazuno into a decline,” said Daisuke Anbo, a leader of a citizens’ group seeking to restore labor and delivery services there. Already, one-third of the prefecture’s companies allow employees to keep working after 70, the highest rate in Japan. At Akita city’s Asahi Taxi, more than half of its 148 drivers are 65 or older.
"There are 850,000 Ohio jobs tied to the auto industry."	They said there are over 300 German automotive facilities in the United States, supporting nearly 120,000 jobs. Instead of imposing tariffs, Merkel said the United States should work with its partners to find a multilateral solution that address its trade complaints. ''Germany will do everything to prevent the situation from escalating," she said. -- Nadine Schmidt and Kevin Tschierse contributed reporting.
The Mexican government forces many bad people into our country.	The bidding war thrusts Mr. Sorrell into direct competition for the first time against the company he spent three decades building. Mr. Sorrell has said that S4 Capital is too small to compete with the world’s largest ad firm. But his stated interest in the technology, data and content sectors places him firmly in a space where ad holding companies like WPP are trying to grow, particularly through acquisitions. Inflexion Private Equity was also interested in MediaMonks, although it is unclear whether it actually placed a bid, a person familiar with the matter said. Mr. Sorrell resigned as CEO of WPP in April after The Wall Street Journal reported that the company’s board had been looking into an allegation of improper personal behavior and whether Mr. Sorrell had misused company assets.
A sitting sheriff cannot be charged except by a warrant issued by a Superior Court judge.	The court documents detail the accounts of four unnamed women, identified as Jane Does 1, 2, 3, and 4. Local reports cited depositions that Large took before his death wherein he reportedly admitted to suggesting some of the women participate in "catfight videos" for money, but he denied the claims of sexual assault. Now his five of his former supervisors, police department, and Horry County officials are facing claims from two of the victims, Jane Does 3 and 4, for allegedly failing to prevent years of egregious abuse. Large died in January, 16 months after he was indicted. On Monday, a judge rejected a motion for summary judgment from the defendants and decided the case would move forward with a trial against the Horry County Police Department and Horry County.
"Since 1999, all Virginia Lottery profits have been used for public education in the Commonwealth for kindergarten through 12th grade."	Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.

Sixty-percent of the state retirees...dont get Social Security.	German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned the Trump administration that hitting auto imports with new tariffs would have dire consequences. ''We now have tariffs on aluminum and steel and we have a discussion that is far more serious," Merkel told German lawmakers on Wednesday. "This is taking on the contours of a trade conflict — I don't want to use words that go any further. It's worth every effort to try and defuse this so that this conflict does not become a war.'' President Donald Trump has threatened to place a 20% tariff on all European cars coming to the United States if the European Union doesn't remove its own trade barriers.
"Over 73% of all donations raised (from the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge) are going to fundraising, overhead, executive salaries, and external donations."	Like most foundation forums, it was a spectacular event, drawing everyone from MacArthur Foundation “genius grant” winner Rami Nashashibi to philanthropic organizations to Tony- and Grammy-winning performer Daveed Diggs. Notably absent, though, was Obama. He did speak briefly in a taped video greeting. Still, Betts said, the forum accomplished what it set out to do — bring people to the table and get beyond the notion that the center is only for one part of town. “Having this global foundation go beyond the South Side and give others the chance to feel like they are being engaged is important,” Betts said.
"If you go strictly by the numbers, crime is down across the board. Last year we had a 10 percent decrease in the most serious crimes."	These numbers are similar to those from a February Quinnipiac poll, where 49 percent of voters said Trump was racist and 46 percent said he was not. Forty-four percent of voters said they think “racist beliefs” were a motive in Trump’s immigration policy, while 50 percent said Trump has “a sincere interest in controlling our borders.” Sixty percent said the policy of separating children from their parents at the border was a violation of human rights. Since enacting the policy, Trump and his associates have repeatedly pushed false, racist narratives to garner support, often associating immigration with high crime rates despite no evidence to support claims that immigrants commit more crime than U.S. citizens. While only 11 percent of Republican voters in the Quinnipiac poll said they think Trump is a racist, 22 percent said they believe Trump has emboldened racist people to express their beliefs publicly. The number of hate crimes rose the year Trump was elected ― the first increase in over a decade.
Sunday liquor sales could generate $3.4 million to $4.8 million a year in additional sales tax revenue for Georgia.	The proposal would:
Legalize the possession and sale of up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana for personal, recreational use for people over the age of 21. A person could keep up to 10 ounces of marijuana at home. Tax marijuana sales with a 10 percent excise tax at the retail level as well as the state's 6 percent sales tax. Split those revenues, with 35 percent going to K-12 education, 35 percent to roads, 15 percent to the communities that allow marijuana businesses in their communities and 15 percent to counties where marijuana business are located. Allow communities to decide whether they’ll allow marijuana businesses in their towns.
"Says the 2010-11 New Hampshire budget ended with an $18 million surplus, while the Republican-led 2012-13 budget has a $40 million deficit."	Murphy got $25 million toward his initiative to eventually make community college free — five times what Sweeney had proposed in the Legislature’s budget, but just half of what the governor originally sought. “Having achieved a budget that includes historic investments in NJ TRANSIT and education and meets our pension obligations, which are paid for in part by new revenues from a millionaires tax and closing corporate loopholes, there is one clear winner in this year’s budget process: New Jersey’s middle class,” said Dan Bryan, a spokesman for Murphy, in a statement Sunday. “The era of budget gimmicks and favoring the wealthy and corporations in New Jersey is ending, and the era of a stronger and fairer New Jersey is just beginning.”
At their press conference Saturday evening, Murphy and Sweeney both glossed over the insults they had lobbed each other. “We had honest, blunt, sometimes heated but always civil discussions,” Murphy said. “It’s never been a disagreement on where we wanted to go.
"Says Barack Obama was silent on Iran when the students took to the streets in Tehran and the people there protested, (and) the Green Revolution occurred."	And next year at this time I want us to have this convention in Tehran.”
He said President Trump’s leadership had made it so that “we are now realistically being able to see an end to the regime in Iran.”
In her speech, Rajavi said, “Since the January uprising, the signs of change in Iran and the regime’s overthrow have appeared. The prospects for the victory of Iran’s democratic revolution, devoid of the mullahs and the shah are looming.” She added, “Through their uprisings and by relying on resistance units, the Iranian people have the leverage they need to topple this regime.”
Saturday’s rally coincided with a series of large street protests in Iran over the Islamic Republic’s dwindling economy and a plunge in the value of its currency, the rial. Several protests took place at Tehran’s Grand Bazaar last week but continued and became violent as the Iranian government’s forces opened fire on residents protesting in Khorramshahr over the lack of potable water in the city’s pipelines. Iranian Arabs, a severely underserved portion of the Islamic Republic’s population, also participated in the protests.
"No candidate has run more negative ads in American history than Barack Obama did in 2008, especially in the general."	The list of Democrats expressing frustration with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has been growing longer in recent weeks, but don’t expect to see former President Barack Obama’s name on it. At a party fundraising event Friday afternoon in Northern California, Obama spoke highly of Pelosi – and even predicted that she will return to the job of House speaker after November’s midterm elections. “I think everybody knows how much I love Nancy Pelosi,” Obama told the gathering at a home in affluent Atherton, Politico reported. "Nancy, I believe, is one of the greatest speakers we ever had, and will once again be one of the greatest speakers we ever have after we get through this cycle," he continued. “And there's not much I could have gotten done without having Nancy there alongside of me every step of the way.”

Oklahomas Republican Gov. Mary Fallin signed a new law which makes you pay a special fee. It will essentially fine people for the crime of using solar power.	The major U.S. stock indexes were mostly higher in early trading Friday following a solid jobs report, keeping the market on track for a weekly gain after two weeks of losses. The modest gains came despite an escalation in global trade tensions as the U.S. imposed tariffs on billions in Chinese goods and China responded in kind. Health care stocks posted the biggest gains, led by Biogen. The drugmaker's stock soared 18 percent to $353.28 on encouraging results from an Alzheimer's therapy. Industrials companies took some of the biggest losses.
Tampa mayoral opponent Bob Buckhorn supported forcing police officers to keep their guns locked in the trunks of their cruisers.	When the leaders of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) crowed on Tuesday that they were "hunting the union, driving it before us" they were not entirely wrong in claiming triumph over the CDU and CSU. Mrs Merkel has failed to achieve her original dream - a Europe that would truly share the responsibility for sheltering asylum seekers. At last week's summit of EU leaders she thrashed out a much tougher policy, working alongside populist governments and other leaders who cherish national interests above those of the European Union. Exhausted and embattled, Angela Merkel is having to adapt to a changed Europe.

"Our unemployment rate has been higher than 8 percent for more than two-and-a-half years, far above what the Obama Administration promised with the stimulus."	Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) trashed the June jobs report — even though it showed rapid job growth, rising wages, and low unemployment. The report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that employers created 213,000 new jobs in June — 22,000 more than economists had expected. Manufacturing jobs in particular rose by 36,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.

Jeff Burke, APS director of resources planning, says customers would see 6 to 14 percent per year increases on their bills if the company is forced to ratchet up renewable use ahead of schedule. "We continue to add renewables to our system, but they have to make sense," Burke said. "It's not really about a target, it's about what makes sense for our customers' usage and what makes rates affordable and what keeps our system reliable." Thirty-two states with renewable standards didn't have, on average, a correlated rate increase, according to Wesley Hersche, an associate director of research with Arizona State University's Global Security Initiative. "These issues involve a complex interaction of factors, and we should be careful not to oversimplify things," Hersche wrote in April.
"State law says that once the state appraises a piece of property, they can only pay it a certain amount above appraisal."	Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.

Hamilton, the Republican state lawmaker who beat the incumbent Karnes, won with a mix of support from teachers and other unions. While Karnes sparred with teachers during the strike, Hamilton took a moderate position. He aligned with teachers unions by opposing state right-to-work legislation and the proposed repeal of prevailing wage laws for public construction projects. The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.
Says he was the only Republican candidate at a prior debate who said lower-income workers were being hurt by the economy.	The first, Antonio Halili, was the mayor of the much larger Tanauan City, south of Manila. Unlike Bote, Halili had developed both a reputation for having a heavy hand against drug traffickers and negotiating with them. Halili appeared on a more recent Duterte list of elected officials with ties to drug trafficking in 2017. Shortly after Halili’s assassination, Duterte told reporters, “I don’t know who killed him, but I told you don’t [engage in illegal drugs]. … His procession of drug suspects was just a front.”
Prior to this accusation, however, Halili had established a “walk of shame” program where he paraded drug suspects around his city for the public to jeer, leading others in the government to suggest he was killed by drug traffickers in revenge for humiliating their peers.

FULL STATEMENT: https://t.co/uE4j5lQPGh #Janus #JanusvAFSCME #Union — NEA Public Relations (@NEAMedia) June 27, 2018
A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

Obamacare is . . . the largest tax increase in the history of the world.	Nearly 600 more retail jobs are to go in the UK as the Jacques Vert, Windsmoor and Precis department store brands are wound down by administrators. Administrators said they had failed to find a buyer for Calvetron Brands, which had been restructured following a rescue deal last summer. The business entered administration in May and had already shed more than 400 jobs before Wednesday’s announcement. The latest retail job losses come as more than 30,000 jobs are at risk in the UK following mass closure announcements by major chains including House of Fraser, New Look and Marks & Spencer. Retailers are suffering from rising costs and the switch to online shopping just as hard-pressed consumers rein in spending.

Says Barack Obama founded ISIS. I would say the co-founder would be crooked Hillary Clinton.	Because it is also a flood plain, the project’s 989,000 solar panels will be mounted on frames 12ft tall – the height of a double-decker bus. Unlike most solar farms, Cleve Hill Solar Park’s panels will not all face south, but east and west in a continuous zig-zag. The effect, say the scheme’s opponents, will be to turn green meadows into something resembling a colossal factory roof. Economically and environmentally the scheme makes no sense whatsoever. Apart from ruining a huge swathe of countryside and killing or displacing all the local wildlife, it will do little for Britain’s energy needs.
"More than 70,000 job openings are listed on a state jobs website."	The economy has added an average 207,000 jobs a month this year after a blowout number of 223,000 in May.

"When the United States invaded Iraq, Saddam Hussein wanted to acquire weapons of mass destruction, and ""he said so himself after his capture."""	Russian forces loyal to dictator Bashar al-Assad killed the son of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the chief of the crumbling Islamic State, while he was hiding in a cave in Syria, Iraqi intelligence agents claimed Thursday. This week’s death of Hudhayfah al-Badri potentially deprives Baghdadi of an heir. Although they do not agree on the circumstances surrounding his death, Iraqi intelligence and Islamic State have confirmed that Hudhayfah al-Badri, Baghdadi’s son, is indeed dead. “The U.S. military said it had seen the reports of al-Badri’s death but declined any confirmation,” Voice of America conceded on Wednesday. Islamic State’s feeble presence in Iraq and Syria, once home to its now annihilated so-called caliphate, has been squeezed into ever-shrinking pockets of territory mainly located along the border dividing the two countries.

A helicopter trip to a hospital may not be the only shock a patient faces after a bad accident. The next one could hit when the bill arrives. Rides in so-called air ambulances can lead to bills of more than $20,000 depending on a person's coverage, and insurance experts say big invoices are becoming more common as costs rise and coverage shifts.

President Donald Trump in May said that drugmakers would soon announce “massive” price cuts, and his administration rolled out a plan to bring down the cost of medicines. But the companies don’t appear to have gotten that message. Bayer raised the price of two cancer drugs by hundreds of dollars in May and Novartis followed by boosting four pricey treatments in June. Pfizer, one of the largest U.S. pharmaceutical companies, announced increases on more than 41 products this week.

The major U.S. stock indexes were mostly higher in early trading Friday following a solid jobs report, keeping the market on track for a weekly gain after two weeks of losses. The modest gains came despite an escalation in global trade tensions as the U.S. imposed tariffs on billions in Chinese goods and China responded in kind. Health care stocks posted the biggest gains, led by Biogen. The drugmaker's stock soared 18 percent to $353.28 on encouraging results from an Alzheimer's therapy. Industrials companies took some of the biggest losses.

"Although the governor doubled the beach fees . . . all the money, as we found out, is all going to an out-of-state company. The state isnt even getting the money for that."	Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.

He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class.

Studies show that people that are on welfare are higher users of drugs than people not on welfare.	Any amount of prescription opioid use was correlated with greater involvement. Among people with prescription opioid use disorder, nearly 20 percent had criminal justice involvement. For heroin users, it was 40 percent. "People who use opioids, including heroin, were up to 13 times more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system," says Winkelman. The study shows the complexity of the the opioid crisis, according to Josiah Rich, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Brown University, who wasn't involved in the research.
"The income of the top 1 percent nearly quadrupled from 1979 to 2007, but the typical familys incomes barely budged."	The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.

Trump has so far announced $34bn (£25.6bn) tariffs on Chinese imports, which alongside retaliatory measures from Beijing are due to come into force on Friday.

If that picture of the country’s jurisprudential future has left liberals distraught, it has also raised questions about the court’s increasingly politicized nature, its power to shape society and the erosion of its independence as one branch of government meant to balance the other two – Congress and the presidency – and to be checked in turn itself. While past courts have had liberal or conservative bents, since the Bush v Gore decision that decided the 2000 election, the court has taken on a more explicitly political feel. “People say the founders would roll over in their graves – I think the founders would hang themselves”, said Mickey Edwards, vice-president of the Aspen Institute think-tank and formerly a congressman for 16 years.

Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.
"It's just outrageous that under President Bush, the National Institutes of Health have been basically decreased in funding."	Pete Rickets questions that guarantee and has said many times that he opposes Medicaid expansion on fiscal grounds. "We cannot trust the Federal Government's long-term financial commitment to state programs," Ricketts wrote in a column on his website. And opponents argue even the 10 percent state share of the cost could threaten other spending priorities, like education and roads. Ricketts said at a press conference Thursday he's concerned about shifting Medicaid's focus from "the people who are truly vulnerable." He suggested the Medicaid expansion population's needs can be addressed "through the private sector, by creating jobs that have those types of benefits."

When Shyaira Dineen was in first grade, a teacher of hers told her to mark her race as African-American on a standardized test. Dineen remembers that day clearly because she says it confused her.

The American Academy of Pediatrics supports banning guns.	Illustration: HuffPost; Photos: Reuters Ieshia Evans is detained by law enforcement as she protests the shooting death of Alton Sterling near the headquarters of the Baton Rouge Police Department in Louisiana, U.S. July 9, 2016. As she sat cloistered inside her Baton Rouge jail cell on a July afternoon in 2016, Ieshia Evans initially had no clue she’d become an icon. As she remembers, food and sleep were the only things on her mind in the 24 hours she spent incarcerated. Evans had traveled from her home in New York City to Louisiana to protest against police brutality and the killing of Alton Sterling, an unarmed black man shot to death by Baton Rouge police. As thousands gathered in Baton Rouge for the July 9 protests, Evans walked into the middle of the street to oppose an advancing row of officers in riot gear.
"Barbara Boxer voted to cut spending on Medicare benefits by $500 billion, cuts so costly to hospitals and nursing homes that they could stop taking Medicare altogether."	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”

German lighting manufacturer Osram Licht's shares plunged 22 percent Thursday after it announced a weaker outlook due to trade tensions. Even hoteliers are starting to fret.

Three years ago, when UIC and the University of Chicago were both engaged in aggressive campaigns to woo the presidential center to their neighborhoods, things got a little testy. People forgot that although there were two separate bids from Chicago, the South Side and the West Side were playing for the same team. Everyone took a deep breath and thought about the alternative — losing the center to either New York or Hawaii. So in a striking show of unity, the two universities came together for a community breakfast designed to send a message to Obama.

Now liberals are anguishing about the potential reversal of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion nationwide. Three Republican senators – Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Susan Collins of Maine – have indicated they will not vote for a Supreme Court nominee who suggests he or she might not respect the precedent of earlier rulings allowing abortion. Moreover, Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona has not shown up in the Senate since last year because he is being treated for brain cancer, and cannot be counted on to be able to cast a vote. With the GOP having but a two-vote advantage in the Senate, the path is narrow. Still, there is little question that the court will likely soon move to the right, and there is little Democrats can do about it.

Stuart Lavery, a consultant gynaecologist at Hammersmith Hospital who was not involved in the study, said women who have recurrent implantation failure are hard to treat. “This mini-trauma offered a real potentially exciting way forward and it has become very widely adopted in international practice and in UK practice,” he said. “Now somebody has been brave enough to do a large randomised control trail and shown it has no benefit.”
Lavery added that he expects practice to change. “I don’t think people will necessarily stop doing scratches, because it is one trial that adds to the literature, but I think people might now pause and really consider whether this might be something [helpful] for patients” he said, noting the procedure is painful. Nick Macklon, medical director at London Women’s Clinic, said in light of the new study endometrial scratching had probably been overused.
Europe and U.S. households waste 15 times more food than a person in Africa.	They are to consult on detailed plans to restrict the promotion and marketing of foods high in salt, sugar and fat. This would target confectionary, biscuits, crisps, cakes, pastries, sugary soft drinks and potentially ice creams, and include restrictions on multi-buy offers, meal deals, unlimited refill deals and where products can be displayed in shops. Newly appointed public health minister Joe Fitzpatrick said "far too many people" were facing "serious risks to their health" which were "largely avoidable". 'Profound impact'
The new government report states that "the Scottish diet remains stubbornly unhealthy", with the country "far from meeting our dietary goals" - something which has a "profound" impact on health and lifestyle. Problems start early, with the report setting out "alarming" findings on the number of children consuming food and drinks high in fat or sugar - studies suggest 29% of children are at risk of being overweight, half of whom are at risk of obesity.
Says of a failed cloture vote on nominating Chuck Hagel for defense secretary: This is not a filibuster.	“There are thousands and thousands of people in this city who want to support him, so that he can win battles,” said Liat Olenick, 32, a member of the liberal group Indivisible’s Brooklyn chapter who spent months directing personal appeals at Schumer to schedule the event. “But he’s not speaking to those people, and we want him to do that.”
During his remarks to constituents on the phone, Schumer tried to energize the Democratic faithful with a play for unity. The Democratic path to victory, he explained, is successfully making the case that Trump’s still-unnamed Supreme Court pick would roll back Roe v. Wade and Obamacare. Schumer also asked activists to spend less time prodding Democrats to use their limited procedural power to delay a Supreme Court confirmation. Republicans last year did away with the filibuster for high court nominees.

"I have no doubt that Andy will continue on with our great and lasting EPA agenda," Trump concluded. "We have made tremendous progress and the future of the EPA is very bright!" In his resignation letter to Trump, Pruitt said: "It is extremely difficult for me to cease serving you in this role first because I count it a blessing to be serving you in any capacity, but also, because of the transformative work that is occurring.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections.

South Korea doesnt pay the United States for U.S. troops that protect their country.	They include the United States withdrawing its 28,500 troops in South Korea, ending its military drills with South Korea and stop bringing in strategic assets such as aircraft carriers and nuclear-capable bombers. North Korea hasn't repeated such specific demands since entering disarmament talks earlier this year, raising optimism that the country truly appeared to seek to improve ties with the United States. After the summit, Trump suspended annual military training with South Korea that the North has called an invasion rehearsal. But North Korea still prefers a step-by-step disarmament process with reciprocal concessions and benefits from the United States for each of the North's denuclearization steps. The ultimate rewards North Korea wants range from the easing or lifting of American-led international sanctions, the signing of a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, the establishment of diplomatic ties and the pulling out of U.S. troops in South Korea, experts say.

XI ASSERTS TERRITORIAL CLAIMS IN MEETING WITH US DEFENSE SECRETARY
Chinese President Xi Jinping strongly asserted China's determination to defend territory it claims, including in the South China Sea, in a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. While the tone of Mattis' visit to Beijing was largely upbeat, Xi made sure to reinforce his reputation as a fervent nationalist when it comes to issues of sovereignty. Though Xi gave no specifics in his statement, he was largely seen as indicating the South China Sea as well as self-governing Taiwan. China also claims territory held by India and uninhabited East China Sea islands controlled by Japan.
Says Rick Scott raised property taxes.	Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.

Medicaid expansion could cost the Commonwealth of Virginia over $1 billion a year...	Nebraska May Join Utah, Idaho in Putting Medicaid Expansion Before Voters
Enlarge this image toggle caption Fred Knapp/NET News Fred Knapp/NET News
Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.
"The Islamic State is so small it couldnt fill a DoubleAballpark in Charleston, W. Va."	Russian forces loyal to dictator Bashar al-Assad killed the son of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the chief of the crumbling Islamic State, while he was hiding in a cave in Syria, Iraqi intelligence agents claimed Thursday. This week’s death of Hudhayfah al-Badri potentially deprives Baghdadi of an heir. Although they do not agree on the circumstances surrounding his death, Iraqi intelligence and Islamic State have confirmed that Hudhayfah al-Badri, Baghdadi’s son, is indeed dead. “The U.S. military said it had seen the reports of al-Badri’s death but declined any confirmation,” Voice of America conceded on Wednesday. Islamic State’s feeble presence in Iraq and Syria, once home to its now annihilated so-called caliphate, has been squeezed into ever-shrinking pockets of territory mainly located along the border dividing the two countries.
There is no evidence that poor people abuse drugs more frequently than any other socio-economic group.	Any amount of prescription opioid use was correlated with greater involvement. Among people with prescription opioid use disorder, nearly 20 percent had criminal justice involvement. For heroin users, it was 40 percent. "People who use opioids, including heroin, were up to 13 times more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system," says Winkelman. The study shows the complexity of the the opioid crisis, according to Josiah Rich, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Brown University, who wasn't involved in the research.

Such restraint contrasted with Trump’s call to López Obrador’s predecessor, weeks after his inauguration last year. During that call, Trump told Enrique Peña Nieto that the US military would take care of “bad hombres” south of the border. López Obrador, or Amlo as he is best known, romped to a historic landslide victory on Sunday night, capitalising on public frustration at soaring crime rates and corruption with a promise to drain Mexico’s very own swamp. Indeed, some see similarities between the two men.

Says gas costs $4.50 a gallon.	For new vehicles, that means an average of about 30 miles per gallon instead of rising to 36 mpg by 2025 as Obama's EPA proposed. — OIL AND GAS: More than a dozen states are suing the EPA for failing to take action against leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, from oil and natural gas wells. Last year, a federal appeals court ruled that Pruitt overstepped his authority in trying to stall an Obama-era rule requiring companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks. — AGRICULTURE: In March 2017, a month after becoming EPA administrator, Pruitt delayed consideration of banning usage of a widely used pesticide, chlorpyrifos, on food crops for at least five years. The pesticide has been banned for household use since 2001, but agriculture groups want to keep using it.

Al Franken said almost exactly what Trump said about John McCains military record.	Meanwhile, other media personalities have faced kidnappings, arrests and physical abuse by mysterious hooded men who no journalist dare name - but every journalist in the country is convinced belong to the military intelligence agencies. But after maintaining months of silence as to what it has endured, or what exactly the military's complaints are, Dawn recently published a frank and stinging editorial. The editorial describes its important, factual reporting about the serious rift between civil and military authorities during the Nawaz Sharif government, which had infuriated the military, and Dawn's insistence on protecting the sources for its stories - a basic element of media ethics worldwide. The editorial states that "a campaign of disinformation, libel and slander, hate and virtual incitement to violence against Dawn and its staff has necessitated placing certain matters on record". It added that elements "within or sections of the state" are not upholding constitutional freedoms.
Veterans unemployment is actually now lower than (the) general population. It was higher when I came into office.	Part of its mission is to provide local veterans with a monthly ration of what he calls medical-grade cannabis free of charge. It started back in 2011.

The office where he's sorting the cannabis sits above one of their grow operations.
"In recent years, Rep. LaTourette has sponsored legislation that would increase spending by 551.6 percent."	There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void.

The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.

U.S. Government lawyers are slamming one of President Donald Trump's most prominent critics, attorney Michael Avenatti, over nearly half a million dollars in unpaid federal taxes owed by his former firm. Avenatti's former law firm, Eagan Avenatti LLP, agreed to make the roughly $452,000 tax payment last month in order to resolve a bankruptcy case, but the funds never arrived at the IRS, according to a filing Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, Calif.

Corporate America couldn’t hire Republican lobbyists fast enough after President Donald Trump’s election gave the GOP unified control of Washington. Now there are signs that Democrats are back in demand. Companies and trade groups are trying to hire congressional staffers with ties to influential House Democrats four months ahead of the midterm elections, in which Democrats are expected to pick up seats and potentially retake control of the House. Lobbyists are helping their clients meet with the Democrats who would become committee chairs if the party does win back the chamber.

Our Founding Fathers resolved that without freedom Americans could not enjoy life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. To secure it, they fought a war to break free from the bonds of tyranny. It isn’t a faraway tyrant that oppresses us today. Rather, we are in the grip of a new kind of tyranny — that of mistrust. This tyrant sits on a throne in our minds and is just as cruel as King George was during the time of the Founders.

Millions of Americans are paying more and getting less under Obamacare.	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
"When he took office in 2009, President Barack Obama had the biggest Democratic majorities in Congress since Lyndon Johnson."	The list of Democrats expressing frustration with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has been growing longer in recent weeks, but don’t expect to see former President Barack Obama’s name on it. At a party fundraising event Friday afternoon in Northern California, Obama spoke highly of Pelosi – and even predicted that she will return to the job of House speaker after November’s midterm elections. “I think everybody knows how much I love Nancy Pelosi,” Obama told the gathering at a home in affluent Atherton, Politico reported. "Nancy, I believe, is one of the greatest speakers we ever had, and will once again be one of the greatest speakers we ever have after we get through this cycle," he continued. “And there's not much I could have gotten done without having Nancy there alongside of me every step of the way.”

The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.
Says Barack Obama is getting his nominees confirmed faster than President (George W.) Bush was at the same time in his second term.	You've got to look at every issue from all sides." "I really have been pleasantly surprised how willing he is to tell Chuck Schumer to go fly a kite," she added, referring to the Senate minority leader. At other times, however, Jones has taken up liberal positions seen as risky for a Democratic senator from a GOP state. He aligned himself with most of his Democratic colleagues against Gina Haspel, Trump's pick for CIA director, arguing that her record on enhanced interrogation techniques was unacceptable. And instead of focusing on a politically safe issue in his maiden Senate floor speech, Jones struck a nerve by calling for a dialogue on gun violence after the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida.
Says Obama promised to cut the deficit in half.	But reports suggest that the mood among some of her MPs has soured. It's not just in pre-election Bavaria that anti-migrant rhetoric has borne fruit. When the leaders of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) crowed on Tuesday that they were "hunting the union, driving it before us" they were not entirely wrong in claiming triumph over the CDU and CSU. Mrs Merkel has failed to achieve her original dream - a Europe that would truly share the responsibility for sheltering asylum seekers.
"In 2009, Democratic Wisconsin state senators rammed through a billion-dollar tax hike in 24 hours with no public input."	Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.

Says Newt Gingrichs contract was with the lobbyists at Freddie Mac.	Even Pruitt’s own staff had begun to sour on him, with many worrying that their future career prospects would be damaged by their association with Pruitt’s tenure.

Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.

The NHS will consume 66% of the Welsh budget by 2048 if demand increases in line with predicted demand, according to new research. Health economist Prof Ceri Phillips said spending on the NHS would need to rise by 4% a year. Currently £6bn out of a total Welsh budget of £14.5bn goes to the NHS. The Welsh Government said its Health and Social Care Plan aimed to reduce demand through more people managing their own health and well-being. BBC Wales Investigates had asked Prof Phillips, from Swansea University, to question existing projections for healthcare in Wales and then calculate how much extra spending would be needed to keep the NHS afloat.

But the Meseberg declaration was widely seen as a disappointment – the concessions that Merkel made will not do much to make the single currency sustainable. Yet even these concessions were immediately – and unsurprisingly – opposed by other northern European countries that are even more hostile to Macron’s vision than Germany.

The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
"After J.D. Hayworth ""was voted out of Congress, he became a registered lobbyist"" who was ""paid thousands by a Florida corporation to lobby the very committee he used to serve on."""	You've got to look at every issue from all sides." "I really have been pleasantly surprised how willing he is to tell Chuck Schumer to go fly a kite," she added, referring to the Senate minority leader. At other times, however, Jones has taken up liberal positions seen as risky for a Democratic senator from a GOP state. He aligned himself with most of his Democratic colleagues against Gina Haspel, Trump's pick for CIA director, arguing that her record on enhanced interrogation techniques was unacceptable. And instead of focusing on a politically safe issue in his maiden Senate floor speech, Jones struck a nerve by calling for a dialogue on gun violence after the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida.
76 percent of doctors support the use of medical marijuana	The proposal would:
Legalize the possession and sale of up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana for personal, recreational use for people over the age of 21. A person could keep up to 10 ounces of marijuana at home. Tax marijuana sales with a 10 percent excise tax at the retail level as well as the state's 6 percent sales tax. Split those revenues, with 35 percent going to K-12 education, 35 percent to roads, 15 percent to the communities that allow marijuana businesses in their communities and 15 percent to counties where marijuana business are located. Allow communities to decide whether they’ll allow marijuana businesses in their towns.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
"We are dealing with an administration that, quite frankly, has shown a reluctance to enforce the immigration law."	He described “unbelievably bad border laws, immigration laws” in the United States, calling them “the weakest in the world, laughed at by everybody in the world.” He contrasted the U.S. immigration laws with “Mexico’s very strong immigration laws.”
Trump suggested that Mexico can help the United States “until we straighten out our immigration laws, which have been bad for many, many years, decades.” He further assured, “We’re gonna have them taken care of.”

Teenagers have been filmed sniffing an "unknown substance" on school grounds. Their school, Venerable Bede Church of England Academy in Sunderland, confirmed there had been an "incident" on Wednesday. Three pupils - two boys from Year 9 and one from Year 10 - had been excluded while the school investigated, it said. The video of the boys has been re-posted on Facebook and has had more than 28,000 views. Northumbria Police said the force had been "made aware of a video circulating on social media which appears to show two pupils taking an unknown substance".

David Shulkin, Veterans Affairs Secretary - 28 March 2018
A doctor, he had served as undersecretary of veterans affairs for health under Barack Obama. President Trump had hailed him as "fantastic" when appointing him, and the Senate gave him the only 100-0 confirmation of the Trump team.
I have won more elections than any chairman since 1938.	That’s what’s happening in this industry,” he said. Numaya, who is also a member of Akita’s prefectural assembly, said Akita’s problems will eventually have a direct impact on Tokyo. “Children born and raised in the countryside move to Tokyo, produce, spend money and get the economy moving. That’s how things have worked since the era of Japan’s post-war economic growth,” he said. “But the countryside is losing ability to bear and raise children and provide them (to Tokyo) because of lower birth rates,” he added.

He said there was also a high sickness rate among officers and problems with staff retention.

The K-9 and his handler tracked down a group of 11 illegal immigrants before the dog fell victim to the heat. Members of a National Guard helicopter crew responded to a call for assistance from a Border Patrol team after a K-9 agent experienced a heat-related medical emergency. The K-9 became overheated while tracking a group of 11 illegal aliens in the desert and harsh terrain near Arivaca, Arizona, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials. Agents in the field contacted the Tucson Sector’s Tactical Operation Center and reported that a K-9 agent became overheated.
"(McCain) says ""we can't have ... timelines to draw down our troops from Iraq."""	Pentagon Questioned Over Blackout On War Zone Troop Numbers
Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images
For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.

"Loranne Ausleys a financial train wreck for taxpayers -- pushing gas taxes, property taxes, taxes on seniors."	Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.
Grocery prices have risen significantly over the past year or so.	Health policy experts say one flaw with the administration’s plan is the lack of any serious follow through. | REUTERS Drugmakers defy Trump's call to drop prices
President Donald Trump in May said that drugmakers would soon announce “massive” price cuts, and his administration rolled out a plan to bring down the cost of medicines. But the companies don’t appear to have gotten that message. Bayer raised the price of two cancer drugs by hundreds of dollars in May and Novartis followed by boosting four pricey treatments in June. Pfizer, one of the largest U.S. pharmaceutical companies, announced increases on more than 41 products this week.
"Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison's ""concession speech came with less than 20 percent of the precincts having been counted."	Trump said Sunday that he would "probably" not ask his Supreme Court pick how they would vote on the Roe v. Wade legal precedent during an interview with Fox News. But he added that abortion rights "could very well end up" being determined on a state-by-state basis after his pick is confirmed. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who beat a senior House Democrat from New York in a primary last week, called on Democrats to stiffen their backbone on the court fight. "The messaging isn't as clear to the communities that we're trying to represent," she said. "Are we fighting, or not?"

A writer for Slate magazine claimed:
Under the Trump administration, even naturalized citizens are now a target. The government agency that oversees immigration applications is hiring lawyers and immigration officers to review cases of immigrants suspected of obtaining citizenship through fake identities or other false information on their applications. Cases would be referred to the Department of Justice, where offenders could lose their citizenship or legal status.

On the whole, Jones, who served as a U.S. attorney in the state during Bill Clinton's second term, is getting generally good reviews at home. According to an April Morning Consult poll, 47 percent of state voters said they approved of the job he was doing, while 25 percent said they disapproved. Twenty-eight percent said they didn't know or had no opinion. But at the Barons game, conservative Republican voters in attendance spoke up about their disappointment.
The White House budget plan will bring domestic discretionary spending to its lowest share of our economy since Dwight Eisenhower was president.	It has nothing to do with “basic human decency”, so it is far easier to scapegoat a junior producer than admit the program was working entirely as planned. A day later, the hosts issued an on-air apology, saying the senator had crossed a line and seeking to disassociate themselves from “unverified rumour and innuendo” about Hanson-Young’s private life. They had no such scruples during the interview, that went on for more than 17 minutes. It would be wrong to say this incident proves that Australia is struggling with the #MeToo movement and what it might mean, although it is. Australia has a blokey culture, and there is considerable backlash to revelations of the ubiquity of sexual harassment, whether low level or more serious.

In follow-up interviews, there was angst over the Trump administration policy, now modified, of separating children from their parents when they cross the border illegally.

President Trump has just said in the past week he's going to raise things like Syria, like Ukraine, like the election meddling issue, really the whole range of issues between us.

McCain supports tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas.	Even Pruitt’s own staff had begun to sour on him, with many worrying that their future career prospects would be damaged by their association with Pruitt’s tenure. Each scandal seemed more damning than the last. Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.

"The president of the republic and his government will be absolutely respectful and support the authorities that are elected," Pena Nieto told reporters. Hovering over the election is the specter of vote fraud, though electoral officials deny it is a possibility with the modern balloting technology and institutions now in place. In both of Lopez Obrador's previous two presidential losses he alleged fraud. In his first loss — by a mere 0.56 percent to conservative Felipe Calderon in 2006 — his supporters held months-long protests in Mexico City and he referred to himself as "the legitimate president." His allies are warning even before Sunday's presidential vote that there better not be any funny business.

Eric Young, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees’ Council of Prison Locals, now prays before he looks at his phone every morning, worried he’ll receive a message from BOP’s director notifying him of a staff death. Young estimates that around two-thirds of his union members were Trump supporters. That makes sense: It’s a law enforcement agency that leans white and male (72 percent male, 62 percent white), and many federal prisons are in rural parts of the country, which Trump dominated. But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau. BOP has long suffered the kind of problems you’d expect for a massive bureaucracy centered on caging tens of thousands of people.

"Under President (George W.) Bush, prosecution of gun crimes was 30 percent higher than it is under President Obama."	The U.S. economy continues to show strength in the wake of tax reform and deregulation, but the downside of robust growth is that Donald Trump thinks this means he can dabble at trade war with impunity. He ought to look at the signs that growth would be even stronger if not for his border-tax brawls. The latest evidence came in the minutes released Thursday from the Federal Open Market Committee’s June meeting. Fed district presidents from around the U.S. reported evidence of strong growth, but along the way came this warning:

“However, many District contacts expressed concern about the possible adverse effects of tariffs and other proposed trade restrictions, both domestically and abroad, on future investment activity; contacts in some Districts indicated that plans for capital spending had been scaled back or postponed as a result of uncertainty over trade policy.”
The minutes continued: “Contacts in the steel and aluminum industries expected higher prices as a result of the tariffs on these products but had not planned any new investments to increase capacity. Conditions in the agricultural sector reportedly improved somewhat, but contacts were concerned about the effect of potentially higher tariffs on their exports.”
These reports are from the economy’s ground floor, not the Beltway penthouse.

"People who use opioids, including heroin, were up to 13 times more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system," says Winkelman. The study shows the complexity of the the opioid crisis, according to Josiah Rich, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Brown University, who wasn't involved in the research. It shows "the spectrum of the disease and its overlap with the criminal justice system, showing that the more you progress along that continuum, the more likely you are to get tangled up in the criminal justice system." The study also showed that most people with opioid use disorder had other mental illnesses and were also more likely to have certain chronic health conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The study authors argue for the need to engage and involve the criminal justice system in dealing with the opioid epidemic, including reducing overdose deaths.

Pruitt remained miserly even when he was abusing his position to get a good deal.

He read Saint Augustine and Hermann Hesse. He found a mentor in his cousin Thomas, who had traveled to Malaysia and Vietnam and was stationed in Indonesia, working at U.S.A.I.D. Thomas mailed back reel-to-reel audio recordings recounting his travels.
"A data system that goes along with Common Core is designed to collect up to 400 data points on each child, which can include personally identifiable data."	The committee said on its website that it received the responses shortly before midnight on Friday; the deadline for the responses was the close of business Friday. It is Facebook’s second attempt at answering Congress’s queries. In June, Facebook delivered 450 pages of answers to two Senate committees, deflecting some questions about its influence and market power while offering some detail about the information it collects on users. Facebook has been under scrutiny since March when revelations surfaced that political analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, which aided President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, purchased data on 87 million users without their consent. In the ensuing hearings, lawmakers asked Mr. Zuckerberg whether Facebook was in violation of a settlement the company made in 2012 with the Federal Trade Commission, under which the company is required to give its users clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before sharing their information beyond their privacy settings.
Alison Alter got an F in attendance in 2016 as an Austin parks board member and was removed by a unanimous vote of the Austin City Council.	The University of Missouri is still facing enrollment and budgetary problems, including a $49 million budget shortfall, as a result of the 2015 social justice protests that caught national media attention. Many people remember the high-pitched yell of former University of Missouri professor Melissa Click. Click found herself at the center of weeks of unrest at the University of Missouri in 2015 and 2016. Click rose to infamy after a video of her calling for a student photojournalist to be physically removed from campus simply because he was documenting the protests. The protests involved accusations by students that the administration had mishandled several alleged racial issues on campus.

They are even now talking about two other former Kennedy clerks for the Supreme Court, Judges Brett Kavanaugh and Ray Kethledge. And they've put a bunch of Kennedy clerks onto the lower courts. And they seem to exploit some connections between the Kennedy and Trump families. Justice Kennedy's son, Justin, had business dealings with President Trump. Ivanka Trump visited the Supreme Court at Justice Kennedy's invitation after the two of them met after the inauguration.
Florida shelled out more money for drug testing than it saved by denying welfare benefits to people who tested positive for drugs.	"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.

Jaguar Land Rover, Britain's biggest carmaker with 40,000 employees, cautioned this week that a bad deal would slash its profits by £1.2 billion ($1.6 billion) a year. Airbus (EADSF) and BMW (BMWYY) also issued dire warnings. The plan announced Friday acknowledges that banking and other UK service industries, which make up the vast majority of the UK economy, would lose some access to European markets. But Britain's biggest business lobby group, the Confederation of British Industry, welcomed Friday's announcement as a "good starting point." "This is a genuine confidence boost and the prime minister deserves credit for delivering a unified approach" said Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director general, in a statement.

Kesha Rogers is not a Democrat.	The president told Fox News that he believes his nominee will get some support from Democrats. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, an abortion rights supporter, is considered one of the key votes on a nominee. She said she wouldn't vote for someone who would overturn Roe v. Wade. "A candidate who would overturn Roe would not be acceptable," she said Sunday on ABC's This Week. Collins, who has previously bucked party lines on other key issues such as health care, said she plans to have an in-depth conversation with the nominee.

FULL STATEMENT: https://t.co/uE4j5lQPGh #Janus #JanusvAFSCME #Union — NEA Public Relations (@NEAMedia) June 27, 2018
A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.
Democrats are poised now to cause this largest tax increase in U.S. history.	Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.
"Says under Mayor Cory Booker, Newark has seen violent crime up five years in a row, murder up five years in a row."	On this much police and activist South Side priest Michael Pfleger can agree: Saturday morning’s anti-violence march on the Dan Ryan Expressway is all about danger. Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.

As well as a new president, Mexican will be voting for 128 senators and 500 deputies in Congress as well as state and local officials. In all, 88 million people will be eligible to vote. Mexico is the second largest economy in Latin America and a major oil exporter. However, oil prices have dropped and the Mexican currency, the peso, has fallen sharply against the dollar. More than 40% of the population lives in poverty and high levels of corruption and violence have led some companies to pull out of the worst affected areas.

When Shyaira Dineen was in first grade, a teacher of hers told her to mark her race as African-American on a standardized test. Dineen remembers that day clearly because she says it confused her. She has a black mother and a white father. "I didn't argue with her," says the 23-year-old, but she did think it was weird. "Why do I feel like I only have to choose one?
I was filibustered.	Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson said Monday she was particularly pleased that this past weekend there were no violent incidents, and she said she thinks that is a more typical weekend in Gary. “These are very unsettling times for all of us in the city,” the mayor said. “We don’t want to ignore our situation, but we should also admit this past weekend (in Gary) was an aberration.”
Pleased with the Common Council’s action was Eakta Kamal, a Munster resident with an interest in gun control issues. “It hits very close to home for us in Gary,” Kamal said. “I think it’s a common sense solution to think that people ought to think our lives are more important than the concerns of a gun owner.”
For Kamal, gun violence is a first-hand experience, as she lost her right arm after being shot while working in a store, she said.

Scott Pruitt is out but his impact on the environment will be felt for years
Scott Pruitt, who has finally stepped down as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency after a long-rumbling corruption scandal, rose to public prominence on the back of a series of increasingly outlandish ethical controversies. Scott Pruitt resigns: Trump's scandal-ridden EPA chief steps down Read more
From lobbying fast food company Chick-fil-A on behalf of his wife, to demanding his staff acquire a mattress from a Trump Hotel – not to mention the millions of taxpayer dollars spent on security, first-class travel and soundproof booths – Pruitt’s behavior clashed spectacularly with any pretense of Trump’s pledge to “drain the swamp” in Washington. But the lasting legacy of the former Oklahoma attorney general – who was picked by Trump after crusading against what he called the EPA’s “activist agenda” – is likely to be felt in the systematic weakening of environmental regulations. While not as eye-catching as, for example, his demand that his official vehicle use sirens so he could reach a French restaurant on time, Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left behind a demoralized agency where staff fret that their ability to protect public health has been diminished. A staunch ally of oil and gas companies, Pruitt stacked EPA advisory boards with industry representatives and sought to set aside whole troves of research that link pollution to various illnesses.
The Chinese last year probably stole $360 billion inintellectual property from the United States.	So we have 50 plus 200 plus almost 300.”
Analysts say tariffs are not the most effective way of putting pressure on China, which the US accuses of unfair trade practices and stealing intellectual property from US companies. Syracuse University economics professor Mary Lovely and researcher Yang Liang found 87% of electronics products to be levied by US tariffs came from multinationals and joint ventures rather than Chinese firms. China’s economy is no longer as dependent on exports. Domestic consumption now accounts for more than half of the country’s GDP. Exports to the US account for only 19% of all of China’s exports.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
Greg Abbott said it would be a waste to expand pre-k to all Texas children.	Hamilton, the Republican state lawmaker who beat the incumbent Karnes, won with a mix of support from teachers and other unions. While Karnes sparred with teachers during the strike, Hamilton took a moderate position. He aligned with teachers unions by opposing state right-to-work legislation and the proposed repeal of prevailing wage laws for public construction projects. The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.
"It costs us, logistically, three times more to fight in Afghanistan than it does in any other place."	Pentagon Questioned Over Blackout On War Zone Troop Numbers
Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images
For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.

Tangredi said the Chinese company persuaded a long-time Dais employee to defect with trade secrets. "They just stole it, and they are using it against us," he said. Tangredi said he hopes the threat of a trade war will force China to rethink its practices: "You've got to do something to get their attention."

The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.

"With Rick Scott, there are more funds for preschool education."	'We’re going to run different'
His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
The children coming across the southern U.S. border were never examined after they got here and quarantined if they had a disease. They were just sent out across the country. Many of them had measles ... We now have an outbreak of it all because of our immigration policy.	In 2014, as part of a training program initiated by the United State's Global Health Security Agenda the labs at the Manipal Center for Virus Research and the National Institute of Virology in Pune were prepared to identify outbreaks of Nipah. "That training really helped us," says Arunkumar. "I ruled out other causes of encephalitis and suspected it was Nipah right away." On the evening of May 18, less than 12 hours after he received the patient's tissue samples, his lab confirmed his suspicion. The very next day, M. Miriyam, the boy's aunt, died.
The Mack Penny Plan for the federal budget would balance our budget by 2019 and continues to gain support.	The proposal would:
Legalize the possession and sale of up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana for personal, recreational use for people over the age of 21. A person could keep up to 10 ounces of marijuana at home. Tax marijuana sales with a 10 percent excise tax at the retail level as well as the state's 6 percent sales tax. Split those revenues, with 35 percent going to K-12 education, 35 percent to roads, 15 percent to the communities that allow marijuana businesses in their communities and 15 percent to counties where marijuana business are located. Allow communities to decide whether they’ll allow marijuana businesses in their towns.

Members of a National Guard helicopter crew responded to a call for assistance from a Border Patrol team after a K-9 agent experienced a heat-related medical emergency. The K-9 became overheated while tracking a group of 11 illegal aliens in the desert and harsh terrain near Arivaca, Arizona, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials. Agents in the field contacted the Tucson Sector’s Tactical Operation Center and reported that a K-9 agent became overheated.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Fred Knapp/NET News Fred Knapp/NET News
Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.
Says Thomas Jefferson helped craft the Constitution.	In an 1873 interview with the Pike County Republican newspaper, Madison Hemings, thesecond son of Thomas Jefferson and his slave Sally Hemings, told a story. It was a story that would confirm the decades of rumors that had circulated since Jefferson ran for president in 1801. Madison Hemings began his recollection of his parent’s taboo relationship with these words:
"But during that time (in Paris) my mother became Mr. Jefferson's concubine, and when he was called back home she was [pregnant] by him. He desired to bring my mother back to Virginia with him, but she demurred.
"Says U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, a candidate for Senate, supports raising taxes by $858 billion."	Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
"Right now, here in Texas, wind power is already cheaper than dirty fossil fuels."	Abbott said on Tuesday night he never conceived of climate change as a moral challenge. “It was an issue, that’s all, and – at least on the actual changes we’ve so far seen – not a very significant one compared to man’s inhumanity to man; maintaining and improving living standards; and even to many other environmental issues such as degraded bush and waterways, particulate pollution, water quality in the third world, deforestation and urban overcrowding.”
He contended that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide from roughly 300 to 400 parts per million over the last century had not triggered “dramatic consequences”. Play Video 0:32 Andrew Probyn calls Tony Abbott 'destructive' in ABC report – video
“Storms are not more severe; droughts are not more prolonged; floods are not greater; and fires are not more intense than a century ago – despite hyperventilating reportage and over-the-top claims from Green politicians,” he said. “Sea levels have hardly risen and temperatures are still below those of the medieval warm period. Over time, temperature change seems to correlate rather more with sun spot activity than with carbon dioxide levels.

Eric Young, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees’ Council of Prison Locals, now prays before he looks at his phone every morning, worried he’ll receive a message from BOP’s director notifying him of a staff death. Young estimates that around two-thirds of his union members were Trump supporters. That makes sense: It’s a law enforcement agency that leans white and male (72 percent male, 62 percent white), and many federal prisons are in rural parts of the country, which Trump dominated. But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau. BOP has long suffered the kind of problems you’d expect for a massive bureaucracy centered on caging tens of thousands of people.
Says Democratic challenger Russ Feingold was the deciding vote on Obamacare.	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”

Shoko Asahara, the founder of the Japanese doomsday cult Aum Shinrikyo, which killed 13 people and injured hundreds more with sarin gas in Tokyo in 1995, was hanged on Friday along with six of his followers, the government said. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, Japan's government spokesman, confirmed the executions to The Associated Press and said authorities were taking precautions in case of any retaliation by his followers. Asahara, 63, whose real name was Chizuo Matsumoto, had been on death row since 2004, when he was convicted of multiple counts of murder after years of court battles.

WASHINGTON – If it's a holiday, it must be time for President Donald Trump to hit the golf course. Right on schedule, the presidential motorcade arrived at the Trump National Golf Club in suburban Virginia in the late morning, the middle of a day that also has the president tweeting and hosting a military-themed picnic later at the White House. As he departed the presidential mansion in the morning, Trump took to Twitter. In addition to a general salutation – "Happy Fourth of July....Our Country is doing GREAT!"

In the trench war between congressional Republicans and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, we have arrived at a crucial battle. A House resolution sets Friday as the deadline for the Justice Department to come clean on the beginning of its investigation into the Trump campaign. We’ll find out if the FBI has been lying to the public. That is, if the department complies. It has flouted so many subpoenas, and played so many games with redactions and deadlines, that the entire House GOP united last week to vote for the resolution demanding submission to Congress’s requests for documents.

HR McMaster, National Security Adviser - 22 March 2018
A lieutenant general with the US Army, Mr McMaster served in Iraq and Afghanistan, where he worked on a government anti-corruption drive. He replaced Lt Gen Michael Flynn, who was fired after just three weeks and three days in the job after he misled Vice-President Pence about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. Time magazine named him as one of its 100 most influential people in the world in 2014, saying he "might be the 21st Century Army's pre-eminent warrior-thinker".
Oregon has never before tried to create a land-use plan for what it should look like for 50 years.	Referendum to remove ‘outdated’ clause encouraging mothers to choose domestic duties over paid employment to be held by November
Ireland to vote over constitution clause on women's role in the home
Ireland will hold a referendum to remove a clause in the constitution marking the importance of a woman’s “life within the home” and encouraging mothers to shun paid employment to fulfil domestic duties, the government has announced. The move unveiled on Thursday is the latest to update Ireland’s socially conservative 1937 constitution to reflect a more secular and socially liberal population. Ireland was long one of Europe’s most socially conservative countries, but opinions have changed rapidly in recent decades as the power of the Roman Catholic church has waned. A 2015 referendum introduced gay marriage into the constitution and a vote earlier this year allowed access to abortion. The constitution, which includes a number of references to the country’s traditional Christian ethos, currently contains a clause that “recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the state a support without which the common good cannot be achieved”.

But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits.

Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.
The House Zika bill limits access to birth control services needed to help curb the spread of the virus in Puerto Rico.	The grandmother meanwhile said she didn't know for about 10 days what happened to her youngest grandchild, 4-year-old Yahir, or his mother. “I was desperate, I called every number I saw in the news, I looked for their faces in the TV reports," Cáceres said. "I was very scared because [Yahir] was born prematurely and he has always been a small and sickly child.”
Then she got a call from Nubia from a jail near the border, Cáceres said. She said the boy's mother asked for money for food because the child had a high fever and was refusing to eat the jail's food. Nubia and her son were released soon after, and Cáceres paid for them to travel by bus from Texas to her Florida home.

Despite no signs of North Korea abandoning its nuclear weapons any time soon, South Korea is literally bouncing ahead this week with peace efforts with its rival, which was threatening war just months ago. Two days of friendly basketball games winding up Thursday in Pyongyang were the latest in a slew of goodwill gestures between the Koreas in recent months. The women's and men's matches came just ahead of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's arrival in North Korea on Friday for two days of talks over the future of the North's nuclear program. A capacity crowd of 12,000 applauded as the teams — dressed in white jerseys that read "Peace" and green jerseys that read "Prosperity" — marched onto the court holding hands. Players from the North and South were mixed into teams for Wednesday's games.
"Doctors kill about 250,000 people a year in botched surgeries."	In some offices, dictation is automated into reports through voice recognition software, but this is an imperfect practice and often requires additional double-checking by a real human. Something that seems like a minor error — a misspelling, for example — can have consequences if that record is ever pulled as part of a malpractice suit. It can also mislead a future provider, influence how the office’s service is coded and therefore billed, or even confuse or mislead the patient when he or she is reviewing records. Doctors are human too, and they often dictate late at night after long shifts. Mistakes they didn’t make during a surgery can occur in the retelling of it.

The list of Democrats expressing frustration with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has been growing longer in recent weeks, but don’t expect to see former President Barack Obama’s name on it. At a party fundraising event Friday afternoon in Northern California, Obama spoke highly of Pelosi – and even predicted that she will return to the job of House speaker after November’s midterm elections. “I think everybody knows how much I love Nancy Pelosi,” Obama told the gathering at a home in affluent Atherton, Politico reported. "Nancy, I believe, is one of the greatest speakers we ever had, and will once again be one of the greatest speakers we ever have after we get through this cycle," he continued. “And there's not much I could have gotten done without having Nancy there alongside of me every step of the way.”

"By the end of this budget Im in right now, taxes will have been cut $4.7 billion in my state."	The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.

Illegal immigration and the crime rate are as low as theyve been in decades.	These numbers are similar to those from a February Quinnipiac poll, where 49 percent of voters said Trump was racist and 46 percent said he was not. Forty-four percent of voters said they think “racist beliefs” were a motive in Trump’s immigration policy, while 50 percent said Trump has “a sincere interest in controlling our borders.” Sixty percent said the policy of separating children from their parents at the border was a violation of human rights. Since enacting the policy, Trump and his associates have repeatedly pushed false, racist narratives to garner support, often associating immigration with high crime rates despite no evidence to support claims that immigrants commit more crime than U.S. citizens. While only 11 percent of Republican voters in the Quinnipiac poll said they think Trump is a racist, 22 percent said they believe Trump has emboldened racist people to express their beliefs publicly. The number of hate crimes rose the year Trump was elected ― the first increase in over a decade.

Between June 2011 and March 2012, Martinez engaged in a scheme in which she impersonated a U.S. immigration officer.

In phase two, Trump says he will target $200bn of Chinese goods and is threatening to put a 20% duty on automotive imports from Europe. Both will inevitably provoke tit-for-tat retaliation. The White House has already signalled what phase three of the programme will involve: new investment restrictions on Chinese firms in an attempt to stop intellectual property theft; and the US leaving the World Trade Organisation on the grounds that the Geneva-based body was designed by the rest of the world to screw America.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images
For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.

Tangredi said the Chinese company persuaded a long-time Dais employee to defect with trade secrets. "They just stole it, and they are using it against us," he said. Tangredi said he hopes the threat of a trade war will force China to rethink its practices: "You've got to do something to get their attention."
Sen. Arlen Specters party switch could end up giving Republicans the ability to filibuster judicial nominees at the Judiciary Committee level so that the nominees never get out of committee.	It was President Obama who left his party in this position. His anti-business agenda was unpopular, but was never revisited. Democrats’ losses over the past decade stemmed in large part from a slow-growth economy that never gained momentum. Even though he received what he called a “shellacking” in the 2010 midterms, and even though the GOP made unprecedented political gains during his tenure, President Obama was always convinced the country was behind him. As Mara Liasson wrote for NPR in 2016: “During Obama's eight years in office, the Democrats have lost more House, Senate, state legislative and governors seats than under any other president.” She noted that the Obama legacy includes “one huge failure: a diminished Democratic Party.”
In 2013, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., invoked the so-called “nuclear option,” discarding traditional filibuster protections for the minority party in favor of requiring only a simple majority to approve judicial and executive branch nominees.
Says only four Texas legislators voted against a law giving in-state tuition rates to certain illegal immigrants.	Republicans are more likely to rate secure borders as a strong value; Democrats are more likely to rate welcoming immigrants and refugees as a strong value. In follow-up interviews, there was angst over the Trump administration policy, now modified, of separating children from their parents when they cross the border illegally. "There's always been immigrants; that's what this country is," says Kimberly Bainter, 29, of Norfolk, Virginia. The United States has become "less welcoming" than it used to be, says Harry Bridgen, 56, a band manager from Studio City, California, adding, "How scared and alone these children must feel." Hundreds of thousands rallied across the country Saturday to protest the immigration policy that resulted in more than 2,000 children separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Says Barack Obama had huge majorities in Congress during his first two years in office and did nothing with them to create jobs in America.	He exploits xenophobia by stereotyping Muslims, shafting Dreamers and separating children from their parents.

"Says Hillary Clinton is proposing to print instant work permits for millions of illegal immigrants to come in and take everybodys jobs, including low-income African-Americans."	Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.

However Yad Vashem said this contradicted decades of historical research and contained "grave errors and deceptions". It said much of the Polish resistance in its various movements "not only failed to help Jews, but was also not infrequently actively involved in persecuting them". Polish assistance to Jews during the Holocaust was "relatively rare", Yad Vashem said, and "attacks against and even the murder of Jews were widespread".

Even as government budgets have tightened, construction of public projects in May rose 0.7 percent to $304.1 billion, the highest since October 2010. That gain was fueled by a 0.6 percent rise in state and local construction, which accounts for more than 90 percent of total government activity. State and local government construction spending was $282.1 billion, the most since September of 2009. Spending on the power grid increased nearly 11 percent on a monthly basis, and is up more than 25 percent over a year ago.

Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

As well as a new president, Mexican will be voting for 128 senators and 500 deputies in Congress as well as state and local officials. In all, 88 million people will be eligible to vote. Mexico is the second largest economy in Latin America and a major oil exporter. However, oil prices have dropped and the Mexican currency, the peso, has fallen sharply against the dollar. More than 40% of the population lives in poverty and high levels of corruption and violence have led some companies to pull out of the worst affected areas.

U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse rewarded Wall Street executives with millions in bonuses.	Even Pruitt’s own staff had begun to sour on him, with many worrying that their future career prospects would be damaged by their association with Pruitt’s tenure. Each scandal seemed more damning than the last. Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.
Says his Act 10 reforms have saved the taxpayers some $3 billion.	There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void. In New Jersey, this is compounded by the fact that the state is located between two big cities, New York and Philadelphia, that are in other states. The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.
"Says the federal health care law upheld by the Supreme Court has improved or saved the lives of more than 4,000 Texans otherwise prevented from obtaining health coverage due to pre-existing conditions."	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
About 3 percent of Gov.

He once sentenced a woman to 18 years in prison for assisting her jailed daughter to obtain drugs that killed her. But he also took the side of seven people who lost their disability benefits because their lawyer was accused of obtaining them improperly. Thapur wrote that the seven were given fewer rights by the government than a “member of al-Queda.”
Appointing Amul Thakar to the Supreme Court is an opportunity to make a bold outreach to the most prosperous of America’s immigrant communities and one that is increasingly important politically. The political benefits of naming Thapar are clear.
"And, as of today, New Jersey state government has less employees than when Christie Whitman left office in 2001."	Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.

LONDON — Over the past century American and British troops have fought side-by-side in two World Wars, Korea and the conflicts in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan. But some lawmakers and experts in the United Kingdom are warning that the British military could soon be seen as irrelevant by the United States unless it receives a colossal funding boost. "There is a concern that the U.K. is falling ever further behind and becoming even more useless from a U.S. point of view," said Andrew Dorman, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a think tank in London.
John McCain said...in December he was surprised there was a subprime mortgage problem.	However, I will say this is all very reminiscent of a lot of conversations we heard in 2008 about the old versus the new guard. I think, look, where are Democrats on the major policies? You know, minimum wage increase. Majority of Americans are there, right? Cortez ran on people over the money.
"More lives are lost from violence against women, sex-selective abortion, female infanticide, suicide, egregious maternal mortality, and other sex-linked causes than were lost during all of the wars and civil strife of the 20th century."	"Unlike our forerunners in 1968, those of us living today have access to something they didn't," said Mary Eberstadt, a widely published Catholic writer, "50 years of sociological, psychological, medical, and other evidence about the revolution's fallout." Some of the lines in Humanae Vitae, when stripped of mid-20th century cultural references, find echoes in contemporary concerns about nonconsensual sexual relations. "A man who grows accustomed to the use of contraceptive methods may forget the reverence due to a woman," the pope wrote, "... and reduce her to a mere instrument of his own desires." "This document that has been so controversial and in many places reviled," Eberstadt says, "actually called the shots on what the future would look like better than any other single source I could think of." Revisionist views of the 1968 encyclical have even taken hold among some Catholics who have not abided by its teaching.

Huckabee supported a tuition break to the children of illegals that are here illegally when citizens are having to pay a higher rate.	The University of Missouri is still facing enrollment and budgetary problems, including a $49 million budget shortfall, as a result of the 2015 social justice protests that caught national media attention. Many people remember the high-pitched yell of former University of Missouri professor Melissa Click. Click found herself at the center of weeks of unrest at the University of Missouri in 2015 and 2016. Click rose to infamy after a video of her calling for a student photojournalist to be physically removed from campus simply because he was documenting the protests. The protests involved accusations by students that the administration had mishandled several alleged racial issues on campus.
The Senate Republican education plan is an unfunded mandate for local school districts.	Germany remains haunted by the Nazis' mass murder of Jews in 1933-1945. Ms Giffey, a centre-left Social Democrat (SPD) politician, said teachers needed more support to combat anti-Semitism, as the problem went beyond the classroom, involving parents and society at large. "So in the coming school year, as a first step, we will send 170 anti-bullying experts into selected schools in Germany, funded by the federal authorities," she told the daily Rheinische Post.

"Obama ""voted for and even sponsored amendments that were intended to kill the (immigration overhaul) legislation."""	Even though he received what he called a “shellacking” in the 2010 midterms, and even though the GOP made unprecedented political gains during his tenure, President Obama was always convinced the country was behind him. As Mara Liasson wrote for NPR in 2016: “During Obama's eight years in office, the Democrats have lost more House, Senate, state legislative and governors seats than under any other president.” She noted that the Obama legacy includes “one huge failure: a diminished Democratic Party.”
In 2013, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., invoked the so-called “nuclear option,” discarding traditional filibuster protections for the minority party in favor of requiring only a simple majority to approve judicial and executive branch nominees. He carved out an exception for people put forward for the Supreme Court. The next year – with CNN describing President Obama as an “unpopular president limping through his second term” – Republicans reclaimed control of the Senate. As a result of that achievement, President Obama’s chances of securing a liberal majority on the high court all but disappeared.
"With Obamacare,You have no options ..you cant get competitive bidding."	“That was a very sad day for the country when that vote was cast,” Trump said in June. But Republican lawmakers dispute arguments suggesting their efforts to undo ObamaCare have been totally fruitless. “We eliminated the individual mandate that said that people had to buy government-approved insurance,” said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo. “In a sense, it blew a big hole in ObamaCare.”
There’s a potential electoral landmine ahead for Republicans hoping to keep their majorities in the House and Senate, though: premium increases. “We’re going to get another round right before the election, which is something the GOP is nervous about,” said John C.

Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.

"I believe, Senator Clinton, you've raised more money from those people (the oil and gas industry) than any candidate, Democrat or Republican."	Research has consistently shown that Trump won because of racial resentment among white voters. Chris Hayes (@chrislhayes) The modern GOP is basically Steve Bannon, Steve King and Stephen Miller on one side engaged in a project to preserve and enshrine dominance for its ethnic/racial base, and Paul Ryan and John Roberts on the other who pretend they have no idea what they’re up to.

Can a carbon tax save the GOP? Climate change is one of many issues that divides the Republican Party.

Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, one of the most powerful conservatives in Congress, has denied reports that he ignored the alleged sexual abuse of athletes while he worked as an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University more than 20 years ago. Allegations that Jordan was aware of sexual misconduct and explicitly was informed of specific incidents of alleged assault by the wrestling team's doctor, first surfaced in an NBC news story on Tuesday. But Jordan — who was an assistant coach from 1987 until 1995, when he was elected to the state legislature — has refuted the claims. "Congressman Jordan never saw any abuse, never heard about any abuse, and never had any abuse reported to him during his time as a coach at Ohio State," Ian Fury, Jordan's spokesman, said in a statement. "He has not been contacted by investigators about the matter but will assist them in any way they ask, because if what is alleged is true, the victims deserve a full investigation and justice."

"But when I pointed out to Cohen that he wasn’t repeating past vows to 'take a bullet' and 'do anything' to protect the president, the longtime Trump loyalist left little doubt about where he stands now, saying simply: 'To be crystal clear, my wife, my daughter and my son, and this country have my first loyalty.'
The current (agriculture) commissioner allowed tainted beef to be sent to school cafeterias.	Full-service restaurants with more elaborate menus and more complex processes, like the Red Hen and those in The Trump Organization properties, are more vulnerable to violations than fast-food eateries with limited food offerings and a streamlined kitchen production line, said Craig Hedberg, a professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Minnesota. And those with repeated violations can get into even more trouble with their local health departments, said Hedberg. Those eateries will be flagged by inspectors, who bring copies of previous reports on their visits and can spot patterns of regulation flouting. How repeat offenses are handled differs by jurisdiction. “It’s very rare to see a perfect score,” he said.

At a party fundraising event Friday afternoon in Northern California, Obama spoke highly of Pelosi – and even predicted that she will return to the job of House speaker after November’s midterm elections. “I think everybody knows how much I love Nancy Pelosi,” Obama told the gathering at a home in affluent Atherton, Politico reported. "Nancy, I believe, is one of the greatest speakers we ever had, and will once again be one of the greatest speakers we ever have after we get through this cycle," he continued. “And there's not much I could have gotten done without having Nancy there alongside of me every step of the way.”

“This was probably the best term that conservatives had in the supreme court maybe in my lifetime,” he said. The term might provide only “a very, very modest preview” of waves of conservative rulings to come, however, because a locked-down conservative majority would likely inspire rightwing activists to bring increasingly aggressive cases, said Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. “It’s not just that justice Kennedy’s successor is likely going to move the court to the right,” Vladeck said.

Trump’s campaign to limit legal and illegal immigration is driving up wages and salaries for Americans in various locations and careers around the country. The beneficiaries include new employees, African-American bakers in Chicago, Latino restaurant workers in Monterey, Calif., disabled people nationwide, high schoolers, resort workers in Hilton Head, construction workers, Superbowl workers, the garment industry, and workers at small businesses, and even Warren Buffett’s railroad workers. Amnesty advocates rely on business-funded “Nation of Immigrants” push-polls to show apparent voter support for immigration and immigrants.

That makes sense: It’s a law enforcement agency that leans white and male (72 percent male, 62 percent white), and many federal prisons are in rural parts of the country, which Trump dominated. But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau.

"Sen. Joe Biden, the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, recommended partitioning Iraq into three separate entities."	Pentagon Questioned Over Blackout On War Zone Troop Numbers

For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.

Indeed, Perkins Coie attorney Marc E. Elias, who reportedly was involved in arranging the payments that resulted in the dossier, made the Nunes list. As did Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson.

The event at UIC drew nearly 350 community activists, representing a broad range of interests, to exchange ideas about some of the city’s most pressing issues. Like most foundation forums, it was a spectacular event, drawing everyone from MacArthur Foundation “genius grant” winner Rami Nashashibi to philanthropic organizations to Tony- and Grammy-winning performer Daveed Diggs. Notably absent, though, was Obama.
"The percent of students who enter high school and eventually earn a diploma or equivalent, or who remain in pursuit of a diploma or equivalent, is 90 percent."	Focusing much-needed attention on the South Side does not give the city a license to ignore other struggling neighborhoods. Three years ago, when UIC and the University of Chicago were both engaged in aggressive campaigns to woo the presidential center to their neighborhoods, things got a little testy. People forgot that although there were two separate bids from Chicago, the South Side and the West Side were playing for the same team. Everyone took a deep breath and thought about the alternative — losing the center to either New York or Hawaii. So in a striking show of unity, the two universities came together for a community breakfast designed to send a message to Obama.
"We have been focusing so much, especially the Texas Department of Transportation, on that 97 percent of people in single-occupancy vehicles."	"We don't underestimate the impact that the deaths of these young people will be having in the community and we would ask that people focus on supporting each other and supporting the police investigation."
There is no state in the U.S. where a 40-hour minimum wage work week is enough to afford a two-bedroom apartment.	Part of its mission is to provide local veterans with a monthly ration of what he calls medical-grade cannabis free of charge. It started back in 2011. Newsom and his co-founder began growing and sharing pot as an alternative to the drugs the VA had them on. It has since grown to serve about 1,000 veterans. The office where he's sorting the cannabis sits above one of their grow operations.
"When those restrictions expire (in the Iran nuclear deal), Iran will have an industrial-size military nuclear capability ready to go."	"We're well, well aware of what the North Koreans have done in the past." Bolton essentially gave North Korea a year to get rid of its nuclear weapons. "We have developed a program, I'm sure that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be discussing this with the North Koreans in the near future, about really how to dismantle all of their [weapons of mass destruction] and ballistic missile programs in a year," Bolton said, setting a much faster timetable than what many disarmament experts think is feasible. "If they have the strategic decision already made to do that, and they're cooperative, we can move very quickly." The Arms Control Association's Kelsey Davenport says that's a big "if."
Says Hillary Clinton will receive her congressional salary until she dies and the Secret Service pays her mortgage.	The list of Democrats expressing frustration with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has been growing longer in recent weeks, but don’t expect to see former President Barack Obama’s name on it. At a party fundraising event Friday afternoon in Northern California, Obama spoke highly of Pelosi – and even predicted that she will return to the job of House speaker after November’s midterm elections. “I think everybody knows how much I love Nancy Pelosi,” Obama told the gathering at a home in affluent Atherton, Politico reported. "Nancy, I believe, is one of the greatest speakers we ever had, and will once again be one of the greatest speakers we ever have after we get through this cycle," he continued. “And there's not much I could have gotten done without having Nancy there alongside of me every step of the way.”

Eric Young, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees’ Council of Prison Locals, now prays before he looks at his phone every morning, worried he’ll receive a message from BOP’s director notifying him of a staff death. Young estimates that around two-thirds of his union members were Trump supporters. That makes sense: It’s a law enforcement agency that leans white and male (72 percent male, 62 percent white), and many federal prisons are in rural parts of the country, which Trump dominated. But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau. BOP has long suffered the kind of problems you’d expect for a massive bureaucracy centered on caging tens of thousands of people.
Sixty percent of the auto thefts that we have in (St. Petersburg) are caused by people leaving their keys in the car.	Those factories are the core of an American operation that employs about 136,000 people, but they're also dependent on components sourced overseas for reasons of cost or availability. About 70 percent of the parts in a U.S.-built Camry, the country's best-selling car, come from domestic suppliers. Toyota on June 27 said that Trump's threatened 25 percent tariff on automotive imports would add $1,800 to the price of each sedan. The carmaker's warning of the dangers of tit-for-tat tariffs was just one of many. German lighting manufacturer Osram Licht's shares plunged 22 percent Thursday after it announced a weaker outlook due to trade tensions.
"Obamas secretary of energy, Dr. Steven Chu, has said publicly he wants us to pay European levels (for gasoline), and that would be $9 or $10 a gallon."	“They have to put out another 2 million barrels in my opinion,” he said in the July 1 Fox interview. “Gas prices are up & they are doing little to help,” he complained again on Twitter on July 4. “This must be a two-way street.

"Says if labor force participation rate were the same as when Barack Obama became president, unemployment would be 11 percent."	Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) trashed the June jobs report — even though it showed rapid job growth, rising wages, and low unemployment. The report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that employers created 213,000 new jobs in June — 22,000 more than economists had expected. Manufacturing jobs in particular rose by 36,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.

For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.

The Trump administration has also become adept at finding obscure, long dormant “national security” clauses in the federal codex to invoke as justification for steel and aluminum tariffs as well as punitive tariffs on Chinese goods (the latter has been announced but not yet enacted).

But in my experience, the less that humans were involved in the oversight and the more heavily the records relied solely on technology (even with stop-gap measures and programming meant to sound alarms when information didn’t compute), the more often aberrations found their way into records ― if not permanently, then at least long enough to conceivably do some damage.

For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
"Says Obama wants to give (Iran) nuclear weapons and Michael Bennet, he was all for it."	President Trump has just said in the past week he's going to raise things like Syria, like Ukraine, like the election meddling issue, really the whole range of issues between us. And I think that, in the president's mind, this is very important, because it gives him an opportunity to size up Vladimir Putin, to see where there are areas where we might make progress together and where there are areas where we may not. BRENNAN: Well, right now, Russia is blanket-bombing Southern Syria. That violates the last agreement Vladimir Putin made with President Trump. Why would he believe that he's in any way trustworthy?

"Over the last 40 years, real wage growth has been flatlined because of the policies of the Federal Reserve ... It was all driven by the Federal Reserve."	Federal Reserve officials last month said they expect to keep raising interest rates and suggested that by the next year, they could be high enough that they could start slowing growth, according to minutes of their discussion released Thursday. While noting a strong economy, Fed officials appeared vigilant about emerging risks, especially trade tensions, and the dangers of an economy that might overheat. The officials noted heightened concerns from businesses about President Donald Trump's get-tough trade policies and that some executives had already scaled back future spending plans because of the uncertainty. They also said they were monitoring changes in market-set interest rates. A narrowing in the gap between short-term and long-term rates has been an accurate predictor of downturns in the past.
"Seniors will have to find $12,500 for health care because Republicans voted to end Medicare."	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”

Collins, who has previously bucked party lines on other key issues such as health care, said she plans to have an in-depth conversation with the nominee.

The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.
"In Texas, a faceless hospital panel can deny life-sustaining care, giving you only 10 days to find another facility for your mother, dad, or young child, even if the patient is conscious."	A toddler born in immigration detention on Nauru will be brought to Australia to receive critical tests after the federal court ruled against a plan from the home affairs department to continue treating her in Papua New Guinea. The two-year-old girl and her mother were flown from Nauru to Port Moresby last month amid concerns the girl was dying of encephalitis. The hospital there had said it did not have the necessary equipment or specialist staff to treat her. She is the fourth refugee child held on Nauru brought to Australia either by court order or by threat of court action in the past seven months. The cost of the girl’s medevac flight to Port Moresby was $137,000 – $11,000 more than the cost of a flight to Australia, which was the option recommended by the department’s healthcare provider, International Health and Medical Services.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Fred Knapp/NET News Fred Knapp/NET News
Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

The 30-page plan contains a series of pledges, including to improve the police response to LGBT hate incidents, more support for LGBT students and teachers and improvements to gender identity services for transgender adults. The proposals, which will receive an initial £4.5m in funding, were welcomed by the campaign groups Stonewall and the LGBT Foundation.
"Under Scott Walkers policies, the typical Wisconsin family has actually seen their real income drop by nearly $3,000 in the last four years."

The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.

People are five to seven times more likely to be murdered in workplaces that allow firearms than in those that prohibit it.	The number of predominantly Christian people killed in Nigeria by Muslim Fulani terrorists in the first six months of this year has dwarfed the fatalities carried out by the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL)-affiliated Boko Haram, a non-governmental organization (NGO) based in the African country revealed this week. In one weekend last month (June 23 and 24), the Fulani stormed nearly a dozen Christian-majority villages in Nigeria’s Plateau state, using machetes and firearms to massacre at least 200 people, including women and children. Referring to the Plateau incident in an article published by Nigeria’s Daily Post, the NGO, known as the International Society for Civil Liberties and the Rule of Law (Intersociety), noted Monday that the fatalities from the Fulani massacre could reach 300, making it one of the deadliest by any group in Nigeria. Intersociety explains:
The total death toll in Plateau State following the 23rd and 24th June 2018 coordinated attacks and killings in eleven villages may most likely have hit 300, from its present 250, out of which 218 bodies have been recovered and buried in mass graves.

The inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire has heard that a senior firefighter who arrived at the blaze just before 2am thought the residents should have been evacuated long before they were. During testimonies that made clear a lack of communication between firefighters, the inquiry heard how Daniel Egan, a senior fire safety officer with the London fire brigade arrived at the fire at 1.58am and immediately thought “we need to get people out of the building.”
“It looked like a film, people were shouting and screaming, they were panicking and wanting people to help,” he said. “My first thoughts were that we needed to get everybody out. I could hear the roar of the tower. It was obvious … you could hear people screaming … it was just so obvious, sorry.”

Trump’s campaign to limit legal and illegal immigration is driving up wages and salaries for Americans in various locations and careers around the country. The beneficiaries include new employees, African-American bakers in Chicago, Latino restaurant workers in Monterey, Calif., disabled people nationwide, high schoolers, resort workers in Hilton Head, construction workers, Superbowl workers, the garment industry, and workers at small businesses, and even Warren Buffett’s railroad workers. Amnesty advocates rely on business-funded “Nation of Immigrants” push-polls to show apparent voter support for immigration and immigrants. But “choice” polls reveal most voters’ often-ignored preference that CEOs should hire Americans at decent wages before hiring migrants.

In one case, Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion that illegal immigrants do not have the same bargaining rights as American citizens and legal workers. “… an illegal immigrant worker is not an ’employee’ under the NLRA for the simple reason that, ever since 1986, an illegal immigrant worker is not a lawful ’employee’ in the United States,” Kavanaugh wrote. In another case, Kavanaugh noted that American multi-national corporations do not have the right to import foreign workers. The Circuit judge explained, “Under the provision of the immigration laws at issue here, mere economic expediency does not authorize an employer to displace American workers for foreign workers.”
Prominent conservative Ann Coulter has also called for Trump to nominate Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, arguing that other judges such as Thomas Hardiman and Raymond Kethledge “are open borders zealots.”

A bill backed by Sean Duffy and other House Republicans could actually require the Internal Revenue Service to conduct audits of rape victims who get an abortion.	Research has consistently shown that Trump won because of racial resentment among white voters. Chris Hayes (@chrislhayes) The modern GOP is basically Steve Bannon, Steve King and Stephen Miller on one side engaged in a project to preserve and enshrine dominance for its ethnic/racial base, and Paul Ryan and John Roberts on the other who pretend they have no idea what they’re up to. While that strategy has worked in the short-term, some Republicans recognize that it can’t work in the long-term, and they’re fighting to save their party from extinction. Can a carbon tax save the GOP? Climate change is one of many issues that divides the Republican Party.

Over the fireplace at Mingo Creek Craft Distillers, a whiskey purveyor in the small town of Washington, Pennsylvania, a portrait of Alexander Hamilton hangs upside down. With snowy hair and a black velvet jacket, Hamilton wears an impassive look that might be described as hauteur. In 1791, to pay off debts the newly formed United States incurred during the revolutionary war, Hamilton imposed the first federal tax on the people of the region. By taxing their most lucrative product, whiskey, he became what he is here today: a villain representing the excesses of the federal government. The town of Washington is only a six-hour drive from Manhattan, but it’s a world away from the Broadway stage where Hamilton, clad in snug white knickers, enjoys a better reputation.
Dan Gelber: On the record against scholarships to help our needy children attend Jewish private schools.	Germany remains haunted by the Nazis' mass murder of Jews in 1933-1945. Ms Giffey, a centre-left Social Democrat (SPD) politician, said teachers needed more support to combat anti-Semitism, as the problem went beyond the classroom, involving parents and society at large. "So in the coming school year, as a first step, we will send 170 anti-bullying experts into selected schools in Germany, funded by the federal authorities," she told the daily Rheinische Post.

Saturdays shootings reflect a disturbing trend. Mass shootings have become commonplace since the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007. There have been dozens of incidents where three or more people have been fatally wounded. Hundreds have died.	Five children 15 and younger were among 23 people shot during a scorching weekend in Chicago. From Friday afternoon to early Monday, 21 people were wounded and two people were killed, including a 14-year-old boy who was shot early Saturday while walking in the Washington Park neighborhood, according to police. About nine hours earlier, another 14-year-old boy was shot in the Loop. He was coming up stairs at the corner of Wabash Avenue and Wacker Drive when he was shot in the leg Friday evening, police said. Late Sunday night, three girls ages 5, 14 and 15 were shot while sitting in a parked car with their mother in the East Garfield Park neighborhood, police said.

The current tax splash is its last throw of the dice, a direct pitch for people who have lost faith in government to take the money instead. It sends the subtle message that the economy is travelling well and there’s money to spare. But it’s the inability of a decentralised wages system to share the growth, and the overreach in destroying Australia’s progressive tax system, that remains the ultimate hand-brake for these cuts to be the path to redemption for the government.

It says coal exports will be slightly lower at $58.1bn in 2018-19, and that iron ore earnings will be even lower at $57.7bn, as falling iron ore prices drive export earnings lower. The Australian characterised that event as coal reclaiming its mantle as the nation’s “top export earner”.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images
For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.

Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.

"But when I pointed out to Cohen that he wasn’t repeating past vows to 'take a bullet' and 'do anything' to protect the president, the longtime Trump loyalist left little doubt about where he stands now, saying simply: 'To be crystal clear, my wife, my daughter and my son, and this country have my first loyalty.'

In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop.

Scott Pruitt resigns: Trump's scandal-ridden EPA chief steps down Read more
From lobbying fast food company Chick-fil-A on behalf of his wife, to demanding his staff acquire a mattress from a Trump Hotel – not to mention the millions of taxpayer dollars spent on security, first-class travel and soundproof booths – Pruitt’s behavior clashed spectacularly with any pretense of Trump’s pledge to “drain the swamp” in Washington. But the lasting legacy of the former Oklahoma attorney general – who was picked by Trump after crusading against what he called the EPA’s “activist agenda” – is likely to be felt in the systematic weakening of environmental regulations. While not as eye-catching as, for example, his demand that his official vehicle use sirens so he could reach a French restaurant on time, Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left behind a demoralized agency where staff fret that their ability to protect public health has been diminished. A staunch ally of oil and gas companies, Pruitt stacked EPA advisory boards with industry representatives and sought to set aside whole troves of research that link pollution to various illnesses.

A Highland Park man who operated a cellular telephone distributorship has been sentenced to two years in prison for evading more than $800,000 in personal and corporate income taxes between 2008 and 2012, according to federal prosecutors. Jordan Ecklerling, 53, the owner of Pagecomm of Illinois Inc., is scheduled to report to the Federal Bureau of Prisons Sept. 28 as a result of the sentence handed down June 29 by U.S. District Judge Virginia M. Kendall. According to the U.S. Attorney’s office in Chicago, Ecklerling paid the $806,099 in tax obligations owed to the federal and state government while the case was pending. He pled guilty in January to one count of tax evasion, which carried a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $100,000 fine. In the plea deal, Eckerling acknowledged that as sole shareholder and company officer, he attempted to conceal income by having the company issue him business checks that he then cashed and used for personal expenses.

The gun was dislodged from Blessing's hand after a struggle with her son's girlfriend, as well as the second weapon, authorities said.

In another case, Kavanaugh noted that American multi-national corporations do not have the right to import foreign workers. The Circuit judge explained, “Under the provision of the immigration laws at issue here, mere economic expediency does not authorize an employer to displace American workers for foreign workers.”

"Just in the past 10 years, college tuition has increased 28 percent."	"People who use opioids, including heroin, were up to 13 times more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system," says Winkelman. The study shows the complexity of the the opioid crisis, according to Josiah Rich, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Brown University, who wasn't involved in the research. It shows "the spectrum of the disease and its overlap with the criminal justice system, showing that the more you progress along that continuum, the more likely you are to get tangled up in the criminal justice system." The study also showed that most people with opioid use disorder had other mental illnesses and were also more likely to have certain chronic health conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The study authors argue for the need to engage and involve the criminal justice system in dealing with the opioid epidemic, including reducing overdose deaths.
"Gov. (Scott) Walker has yet to create a job, he gives away millions to his friends, and he raises taxes on working people."	3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.
"Because of President Barack Obamas failure to push job creation, the black unemployment rate in Ferguson, Mo., is three times higher than the white unemployment rate."	In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners. Alas, he is wasting his time trying to shift the views of the Democratic Party, which has become ever more left-wing, if not outright socialist. I think it is time for Mr. James to become a Republican. Guy Randolph

"70 percent of the people who voted on June 5, 2012, just didnt feel comfortable with the recall of the governor, weakening any idea that Wisconsin is fully behind this Walker agenda."	State Sen. Sam McCann will appear on the November ballot as a third-party candidate for governor after Republicans aligned with Gov. Bruce Rauner declined to challenge his candidacy. Monday marked the deadline to dispute the validity of candidate petitions with the Illinois State Board of Elections. But a spokesman for the Illinois Republican Party said the group decided not to pursue a challenge after a review found McCann had reached the 25,000 signatures needed to qualify. McCann, a Republican from central Illinois, is running for governor under the new banner of the Conservative Party.
"A sign in Dearborn, Mich., for the Advancement of Islamic Agenda for America says, Allah be praised. America we will kill you all and nothing you can do to stop it."	Yet people usually have a gut sense of which has been adopted. They also know which will lead to real solutions. Sayeeda Warsi, formerly the chair of the Conservative party, has demanded that it launch a full and independent inquiry into Islamophobia (or, as she put it, a “fuck the Muslims” tendency) within the party, echoing a call from the Muslim Council of Britain. Lady Warsi, the MCB and other critics point to cases including the Conservative councillor suspended after sharing an article calling Muslims “parasites” and Tory MP Bob Blackman, who retweeted a message from the founder of the English Defence League (by mistake, he says) and was a member of an Islamophobic Facebook group (to which he says he was added without his knowledge). Most damaging of all – because it was a matter of party strategy, not just the action or words of an individual – was the London mayoral campaign of Zac Goldsmith, which sought to tar Sadiq Khan as an extremist, and the subsequent attempts to justify those tactics.

Five children 15 and younger were among 23 people shot during a scorching weekend in Chicago. From Friday afternoon to early Monday, 21 people were wounded and two people were killed, including a 14-year-old boy who was shot early Saturday while walking in the Washington Park neighborhood, according to police. About nine hours earlier, another 14-year-old boy was shot in the Loop. He was coming up stairs at the corner of Wabash Avenue and Wacker Drive when he was shot in the leg Friday evening, police said.

"When it comes to taking cuts in tough budget times, Wisconsin state workers havent had to sacrifice."	Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
Says Donald Trump has been talking about the option of using a nuclear weapon against our Western European allies.	According to a Russian state media report related by Turkey’s Hurriyet Daily News , the United States is planning to send next-generation B61 nuclear gravity bombs to NATO bases in several European countries, including Turkey. The bomb is said to be compatible with F-35 joint strike fighters, which Turkey is also due to receive amid some controversy. Hurriyet describes the B61 nuclear bomb and Russia’s sour reaction to the prospect of NATO bases receiving them:
The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) and the U.S. Air Force completed two non-nuclear system qualification flight tests of the B61-12 gravity bomb on June 9 at Tonopah Test Range in Nevada, according to a June 29 statement by DOE/NNSA. The test, which was reportedly the first of its kind, was aimed at extending the B61 bomb’s service life by adapting it to next generation aircraft, including B-2A Spirit Bomber. “The B61-12 LEP will consolidate and replace the existing B61 bomb variants in the [U.S.] nuclear stockpile.

Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center, said that the center doesn’t weigh in on potential judicial appointees, but that open hostility to the agency’s mission would be cause for concern. “Obviously, it would be concerning if there was a justice that was inclined to invalidate the CFPB,” she said. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, renamed the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection under acting director Mick Mulvaney, returned nearly $12 billion to 29 million customers of financial services companies from 2011 to 2017 under its original director, Richard Cordray, an Obama appointee and former Ohio attorney general. But the CFPB’s structure — in fact, its very existence — has been a lightning rod since the agency’s inception. Opponents say not making the CFPB subject to the congressional appropriations process — it’s funded directly by the Federal Reserve — gives it unchecked power; supporters counter that having the central bank as its funding source protects the CFPB from partisan-driven attempts to starve it of resources.
Says the National Labor Relations Board told Boeing that it couldnt build a factory in South Carolina because South Carolina is a right-to-work state.	Those factories are the core of an American operation that employs about 136,000 people, but they're also dependent on components sourced overseas for reasons of cost or availability. About 70 percent of the parts in a U.S.-built Camry, the country's best-selling car, come from domestic suppliers. Toyota on June 27 said that Trump's threatened 25 percent tariff on automotive imports would add $1,800 to the price of each sedan. The carmaker's warning of the dangers of tit-for-tat tariffs was just one of many. German lighting manufacturer Osram Licht's shares plunged 22 percent Thursday after it announced a weaker outlook due to trade tensions.
"Since Newtown, more people have died at the end of a gun than we have lost in Afghanistan."	On this much police and activist South Side priest Michael Pfleger can agree: Saturday morning’s anti-violence march on the Dan Ryan Expressway is all about danger. Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.

In its statement, Delancey said it remained committed to ensuring the continued maintenance of the centre but added that it was over 50 years old, “and as is often the way with older buildings, some elements do unfortunately fail”. The delay in repairing the escalator was because it was so old, spare parts were no longer made and had to be specially manufactured, the spokeswoman said.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.

"When I became governor, I inherited a large deficit. You know what? We just turned that into the largest surplus in Virginia history."	Delivering a speech in Newcastle on Thursday, he said: “At the moment, protectionism is largely just talk (and tweets). But what if rhetoric becomes reality?”
Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.

"John McCain opposed bankruptcy protections for families ""who were only in bankruptcy because of medical expenses they couldn't pay."""	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”

In one case, Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion that illegal immigrants do not have the same bargaining rights as American citizens and legal workers. “… an illegal immigrant worker is not an ’employee’ under the NLRA for the simple reason that, ever since 1986, an illegal immigrant worker is not a lawful ’employee’ in the United States,” Kavanaugh wrote. In another case, Kavanaugh noted that American multi-national corporations do not have the right to import foreign workers. The Circuit judge explained, “Under the provision of the immigration laws at issue here, mere economic expediency does not authorize an employer to displace American workers for foreign workers.”

Claims Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said she prefers the South African Constitution over the United States Constitution.	Though they won’t admit it, Democrats are suffering continued fallout from the arrogance of the Obama White House. Liberals are furious that President Trump will have the opportunity to appoint another justice to the Supreme Court, thus cementing a conservative majority for the foreseeable future. Moreover, liberals are upset that the Trump administration may have convinced Justice Anthony Kennedy to recently announce his retirement, viewing that effort as dirty pool. That Kennedy, age 81, is nobody’s fool – and is unlikely to have been manipulated – appears irrelevant. The real offense, which actually merits outrage from the left, is that President Obama did not convince liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to retire during the many years that Democrats controlled the Senate.
Says Hillary Clinton was literally present when we pressed the reset button with Russia just a few months after Russia had invaded Georgia.	President Trump has just said in the past week he's going to raise things like Syria, like Ukraine, like the election meddling issue, really the whole range of issues between us. And I think that, in the president's mind, this is very important, because it gives him an opportunity to size up Vladimir Putin, to see where there are areas where we might make progress together and where there are areas where we may not. BRENNAN: Well, right now, Russia is blanket-bombing Southern Syria. That violates the last agreement Vladimir Putin made with President Trump. Why would he believe that he's in any way trustworthy?
Our national debt ... is on track to exceed the size of our entire economy ... in just two more years.	Federal Reserve officials last month said they expect to keep raising interest rates and suggested that by the next year, they could be high enough that they could start slowing growth, according to minutes of their discussion released Thursday. While noting a strong economy, Fed officials appeared vigilant about emerging risks, especially trade tensions, and the dangers of an economy that might overheat. The officials noted heightened concerns from businesses about President Donald Trump's get-tough trade policies and that some executives had already scaled back future spending plans because of the uncertainty. They also said they were monitoring changes in market-set interest rates. A narrowing in the gap between short-term and long-term rates has been an accurate predictor of downturns in the past.

He contended that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide from roughly 300 to 400 parts per million over the last century had not triggered “dramatic consequences”. Play Video 0:32 Andrew Probyn calls Tony Abbott 'destructive' in ABC report – video

Says challenger Dominic Chavez is a Rick Perry Republican lobbyist.	It was no surprise to read that the very first lesson you suggest could be learned from overseas (Five things the NHS could do to improve service, 3 July) is the establishment of integrated health and social care, as has happened in New Zealand. The achievements of the Attlee government are at the heart of my socialist beliefs but the compromises which led then to the split between free NHS care and means-tested social care remain the achilles heel as the NHS celebrates 70 years. It is utterly ludicrous to have separate systems which imply distinct and neat boundaries between health and care, with rather a lot of people making a good living arguing on which side of the fence some poor demented soul belongs. Disputes around the funding of continuing care have become a major industry. The recent NHS funding announcement, making no reference whatsoever to social care, evidenced the fact that the government still hasn’t the least idea of how the two are umbilically linked.

The report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that employers created 213,000 new jobs in June — 22,000 more than economists had expected. Manufacturing jobs in particular rose by 36,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.

"Says Scott Walker cut taxes for the wealthiest and raised taxes on 140,000 Wisconsin families."	3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.

In other cities, rising salaries would be a boon to public coffers, but, Seattle is burdened with one of the most regressive tax systems in the country. With no income tax, the financing of public works falls more heavily on the less well off through sales and property taxes. “We have a tax system in which if you’re making less than $25,000, you’re paying about 18% of your income in state and local taxes.

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Sunday that President Donald Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court should not seek to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that enshrined abortion rights in the United States. “Roe v. Wade is a constitutional right that is well-established,” Collins said on “State of the Union” on CNN. “And no less an authority than Chief Justice [John] Roberts said that repeatedly at his confirmation hearing.“

Trump last week said he wouldn’t ask potential Supreme Court nominees about abortion rights — a departure from his stance on the campaign trail, when he said he would only nominate justices to the Supreme Court who oppose abortion. “I think what he said as the candidate may not have been informed by the legal advice that he now has,” Collins told Jake Tapper.
"Says that under City Council Member Randi Shade, Austin had the highest city debt per person in Texas."	The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.
Gross income tax receipts are exceeding the Administrations projections for this fiscal year prior to Sandy.	Corporate America couldn’t hire Republican lobbyists fast enough after President Donald Trump’s election gave the GOP unified control of Washington. Now there are signs that Democrats are back in demand. Companies and trade groups are trying to hire congressional staffers with ties to influential House Democrats four months ahead of the midterm elections, in which Democrats are expected to pick up seats and potentially retake control of the House. Lobbyists are helping their clients meet with the Democrats who would become committee chairs if the party does win back the chamber. And trade groups are talking to members about what to expect from a Democratic takeover.
"Because of a local version of Amendment 4, the taxpayers of St. Pete Beach have had to pay hundreds of thousands in legal bills."	There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void. In New Jersey, this is compounded by the fact that the state is located between two big cities, New York and Philadelphia, that are in other states. The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.
"Doctors, nurses, hospitals, even the pharmaceutical industry, (and) AARP say that health reform makes sense to do."	Health policy experts say one flaw with the administration’s plan is the lack of any serious follow through. | REUTERS Drugmakers defy Trump's call to drop prices
President Donald Trump in May said that drugmakers would soon announce “massive” price cuts, and his administration rolled out a plan to bring down the cost of medicines. But the companies don’t appear to have gotten that message. Bayer raised the price of two cancer drugs by hundreds of dollars in May and Novartis followed by boosting four pricey treatments in June. Pfizer, one of the largest U.S. pharmaceutical companies, announced increases on more than 41 products this week.

If not, it could make good on a promise to unilaterally introduce tougher immigration controls, potentially shattering its alliance with Merkel’s Christian Democrats and toppling her three-month-old government.

In his first loss — by a mere 0.56 percent to conservative Felipe Calderon in 2006 — his supporters held months-long protests in Mexico City and he referred to himself as "the legitimate president." His allies are warning even before Sunday's presidential vote that there better not be any funny business.
Says the U.S. election system is rigged.	The problem is so pervasive that a lawmaker recently asked El Salvador's Legislative Assembly for national identity cards to be issued without addresses "to save lives." Fifteen years ago, the Salvadoran government began a crackdown on gangs, resulting in thousands of members being imprisoned. Yet they continued to proliferate, even running operations with cell phones from behind bars. El Salvador's defense minister said in 2015 there were 60,000 gang members in the country, compared to a combined police and army strength of 50,000. Members of those security forces contribute to the violence that is causing the northward migration.

It says the areas of concern include the Pacific Crest Trail, Mount Ashland and the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument.

Some former Remain campaigners want the government to pursue close ties to the EU to avoid barriers to trade with Europe - but Eurosceptics say the UK needs freedom to set its own independent trade policy. After two alternative models for customs were criticised, Downing Street has come up with what it calls a "third way" solution to be presented on Friday, claiming it will offer "the best of both worlds" - frictionless trade with Europe and the freedom to strike international trade deals.
"Scary fact about our national debt. In 1791 it was $75 million. Today, it rises by that amount in about an hour."	Over the fireplace at Mingo Creek Craft Distillers, a whiskey purveyor in the small town of Washington, Pennsylvania, a portrait of Alexander Hamilton hangs upside down. With snowy hair and a black velvet jacket, Hamilton wears an impassive look that might be described as hauteur. In 1791, to pay off debts the newly formed United States incurred during the revolutionary war, Hamilton imposed the first federal tax on the people of the region. By taxing their most lucrative product, whiskey, he became what he is here today: a villain representing the excesses of the federal government. The town of Washington is only a six-hour drive from Manhattan, but it’s a world away from the Broadway stage where Hamilton, clad in snug white knickers, enjoys a better reputation.

"Romneycare is a top-down, government-run health care system."	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”

"The damage caused by these employees’ actions extends far beyond the scope of the (Clinton) investigation and goes to the heart of the FBI’s reputation for neutral fact finding and political independence." Goelman, in an op-ed in USA TODAY last month, said Strzok has become the victim of "political gamesmanship" by Congress and President Trump, who has repeatedly tweeted about Strzok as evidence of bias by the FBI and Justice Department.

The list was sent to House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA). Many of the names are tied to the discredited anti-Trump dossier produced by the controversial Fusion GPS firm, which was paid for its dossier work by both Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) via the Perkins Coie lawfirm. Indeed, Perkins Coie attorney Marc E. Elias, who reportedly was involved in arranging the payments that resulted in the dossier, made the Nunes list. As did Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson.
"Over 214,000 doctors opt out of Obamacare exchanges."	Straight-A students are being turned away from British medical schools and forced to pay for training in Eastern Europe, while the National Health Service (NHS) plunders the Third World for already-trained doctors instead. The Daily Mail spoke to a number of star students who earned top A-levels and supplemented their CVs with spells volunteering at local GP surgeries, overseas clinics, hospices, and pharmacies — and even earned degrees in related fields such as Biomedical Science — who were turned away from British medical schools, despite the NHS facing a shortfall of some 10,000 doctors. Department of Health and Social Care figures show that only 6,000 of 18,000 medical school applicants were awarded places last year — with many of the 6,000 likely going to foreign applicants, who have often been favoured over British applicants. In fact, the Mail found that so many talented would-be medical students were being rejected that a cottage industry of English-language medical schools in countries such as Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Armenia, and Georgia have sprung up to cater to them — but even this option is not available to youngsters who cannot afford the fees.

Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey.

The United States has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world.	That will allow Trump to argue that his tough approach to trade is paying off. There are reasons why the US economy is currently strong, but none of them have anything to do with tariffs on imports.

Mickey Levy, chief US economist for Berenberg, says Trump’s deregulation agenda has been a factor in boosting America’s underlying growth rate.

BREAKING ... ABC NEWS' GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS SPOKE TO MICHAEL COHEN: "Michael Cohen says family and country, not President Trump, is his 'first loyalty'": "When I asked Cohen directly what he would do if prosecutors forced him to choose between protecting the president and protecting his family, he said his family is 'my first priority.' "Cohen added: 'Once I understand what charges might be filed against me, if any at all, I will defer to my new counsel, Guy Petrillo, for guidance.' Story Continued Below
"But when I pointed out to Cohen that he wasn’t repeating past vows to 'take a bullet' and 'do anything' to protect the president, the longtime Trump loyalist left little doubt about where he stands now, saying simply: 'To be crystal clear, my wife, my daughter and my son, and this country have my first loyalty.'
A legacy of taxing and borrowing crippled the economy we inherited two years ago.	Delivering a speech in Newcastle on Thursday, he said: “At the moment, protectionism is largely just talk (and tweets). But what if rhetoric becomes reality?”
Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.
The Arizona State Board of Educations failure to report teachers whose certifications have been revoked or suspended ... resulted in the death of a student.	Hamilton, the Republican state lawmaker who beat the incumbent Karnes, won with a mix of support from teachers and other unions. While Karnes sparred with teachers during the strike, Hamilton took a moderate position. He aligned with teachers unions by opposing state right-to-work legislation and the proposed repeal of prevailing wage laws for public construction projects. The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.

Corporate America couldn’t hire Republican lobbyists fast enough after President Donald Trump’s election gave the GOP unified control of Washington.

Companies and trade groups are trying to hire congressional staffers with ties to influential House Democrats four months ahead of the midterm elections, in which Democrats are expected to pick up seats and potentially retake control of the House. Lobbyists are helping their clients meet with the Democrats who would become committee chairs if the party does win back the chamber. And trade groups are talking to members about what to expect from a Democratic takeover.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Fred Knapp/NET News Fred Knapp/NET News
Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.

It’s not strictly true to say everyone is against the three huge plant-forested glass spheres at what Amazon calls its “campus” in the heart of the city. The Bezos balls, as the conservatories are popularly known, are modelled on the greenhouses at London’s Kew Gardens, feature walkways above fig trees, ferns and rhododendrons, and provide hot-desking for Amazon workers looking for a break from the neighbouring office tower.

That 59 divisions in Philly had no votes for Romney in 2012 is (a) mathematical and statistical impossibility.	Cult activities escalated after the defeat of Aum members in the 1990 parliamentary election. During their bizarre election campaign, Asahara and his top disciples sang and danced to the guru's songs. In June 1994, the cult spread sarin gas in Matsumoto in central Japan, killing eight people and injuring more than 140 others, in an attack targeting residents who were protesting the cult's presence in their neighborhood and court officials handling their legal disputes. Nakagawa and key members produced sarin at a cult compound and sprayed it from a van, in what was later regarded as an experiment for the subsequent subway gassing. Under intensifying scrutiny from the government, the cult plotted the larger sarin attack on the subways in Tokyo on March 20, 1995.

Under the sanctions, any assets belonging to the three officials in the United States are blocked and U.S. citizens are prohibited from engaging in transactions with them or entities they own or control, the Treasury said in a statement. “The violence perpetrated by the government of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega against the Nicaraguan people and the efforts of those close to the Ortega regime to illicitly enrich themselves is deeply disturbing and completely unacceptable,” Sigal Mandelker, undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a statement. The United States accused Madriz of ordering the Nicaraguan police to set fire to a house in the capital, Managua, killing six people, including two children. It said police also asked gang leaders in Nicaragua to attack anti-government protesters, fired on and killed peaceful protesters. Briones ordered attacks against elderly and young people protesting peacefully, ordered violent attacks against anti-government marchers and beat protesters and stole money from Managua municipal projects, according to the Treasury.

"I really have been pleasantly surprised how willing he is to tell Chuck Schumer to go fly a kite," she added, referring to the Senate minority leader. At other times, however, Jones has taken up liberal positions seen as risky for a Democratic senator from a GOP state. He aligned himself with most of his Democratic colleagues against Gina Haspel, Trump's pick for CIA director, arguing that her record on enhanced interrogation techniques was unacceptable. And instead of focusing on a politically safe issue in his maiden Senate floor speech, Jones struck a nerve by calling for a dialogue on gun violence after the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida.

Tangredi said he hopes the threat of a trade war will force China to rethink its practices: "You've got to do something to get their attention."
Donald Trump says all Mexicans are rapists.	These numbers are similar to those from a February Quinnipiac poll, where 49 percent of voters said Trump was racist and 46 percent said he was not. Forty-four percent of voters said they think “racist beliefs” were a motive in Trump’s immigration policy, while 50 percent said Trump has “a sincere interest in controlling our borders.” Sixty percent said the policy of separating children from their parents at the border was a violation of human rights. Since enacting the policy, Trump and his associates have repeatedly pushed false, racist narratives to garner support, often associating immigration with high crime rates despite no evidence to support claims that immigrants commit more crime than U.S. citizens. While only 11 percent of Republican voters in the Quinnipiac poll said they think Trump is a racist, 22 percent said they believe Trump has emboldened racist people to express their beliefs publicly. The number of hate crimes rose the year Trump was elected ― the first increase in over a decade.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.
Says Texas high school graduates must pass Algebra II to be eligible for automatic admission to states public universities.	Straight-A students are being turned away from British medical schools and forced to pay for training in Eastern Europe, while the National Health Service (NHS) plunders the Third World for already-trained doctors instead. The Daily Mail spoke to a number of star students who earned top A-levels and supplemented their CVs with spells volunteering at local GP surgeries, overseas clinics, hospices, and pharmacies — and even earned degrees in related fields such as Biomedical Science — who were turned away from British medical schools, despite the NHS facing a shortfall of some 10,000 doctors. Department of Health and Social Care figures show that only 6,000 of 18,000 medical school applicants were awarded places last year — with many of the 6,000 likely going to foreign applicants, who have often been favoured over British applicants. In fact, the Mail found that so many talented would-be medical students were being rejected that a cottage industry of English-language medical schools in countries such as Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Armenia, and Georgia have sprung up to cater to them — but even this option is not available to youngsters who cannot afford the fees.

In their statement, Mr Netanyahu and Mr Morawiecki praised the Polish wartime government-in-exile, saying it tried to "raise awareness among Western allies of the systematic murder" of Polish Jews. They also said structures of the Polish underground state supervised by the Polish government-in-exile "created a mechanism of systematic help and support to Jewish people". However Yad Vashem said this contradicted decades of historical research and contained "grave errors and deceptions". It said much of the Polish resistance in its various movements "not only failed to help Jews, but was also not infrequently actively involved in persecuting them". Polish assistance to Jews during the Holocaust was "relatively rare", Yad Vashem said, and "attacks against and even the murder of Jews were widespread".
Our graduation rate is the highest it's ever been.	Any amount of prescription opioid use was correlated with greater involvement. Among people with prescription opioid use disorder, nearly 20 percent had criminal justice involvement. For heroin users, it was 40 percent.

Saturday night's decision came shortly after civil rights group LatinoJustice PRLDEF filed a lawsuit seeking relief for the Puerto Ricans, whose federal housing assistance vouchers were set to expire at midnight Sunday, meaning the evacuees could have been evicted from the hotels. The order says the agency cannot end its Transitional Sheltering Assistance program until at least midnight on Tuesday. The organization is pushing to let families stay another six months.

The overall fact about illegal immigration is that its not actually getting worse.

Once women migrants cross the border into the United States, they risk losing their children and may struggle to get a hold of basic necessities, like clean underwear and menstrual hygiene products. In addition to offering help with obtaining asylum, nonprofits and immigration attorneys offer these women a safe space where they can have some time to focus on their own needs, instead of just the needs of their children. “The journey has been so treacherous for some,” said Brenda Riojas, communications director for Catholic Charities Respite Center, a McAllen, Texas-based group that caters to migrants who were freed from detention and need a place to regroup before connecting with relatives. “Because we have so many volunteers, they can trust somebody to watch their children.

The United States sends $300 billion -- half our trade deficit -- overseas for oil to unstable and unfriendly regimes.	WASHINGTON -- Ahead of next week's NATO summit in Brussels, President Trump sent a letter to the prime minister of Norway that made clear he will not relent on his criticism of NATO allies' lagging defense budgets. Norway, the president wrote, "remains the only NATO ally sharing a border with Russia that lacks a credible plan to spend 2 percent of its gross domestic product on defense." Norway is far from alone as a target of criticism -- the president has reportedly sent similar letters to other countries. Of the 28 NATO nations, only three besides the U.S. spent the promised 2 percent of GDP on defense last year. Throughout his presidency, Mr. Trump has prodded NATO nations to spend more.

The United States has always been both a major producer and consumer of oil, which means that most presidents have favored moderate oil prices. High prices hurt motorists and oil consumers across the country.
Rick Scott tried to slash school funding by $3.3 billion.	There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void. In New Jersey, this is compounded by the fact that the state is located between two big cities, New York and Philadelphia, that are in other states. The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.

Trump said Sunday that he would "probably" not ask his Supreme Court pick how they would vote on the Roe v. Wade legal precedent during an interview with Fox News. But he added that abortion rights "could very well end up" being determined on a state-by-state basis after his pick is confirmed. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who beat a senior House Democrat from New York in a primary last week, called on Democrats to stiffen their backbone on the court fight. "The messaging isn't as clear to the communities that we're trying to represent," she said. "Are we fighting, or not?"

Speaking to the media last week, Collaery said Witness K was not a whistleblower, and had gone through the proper internal channels to raise concerns about the operation. He had made a complaint to the inspector general of intelligence and security, and was given permission to disclose the operation, Collaery said. Collaery has been charged with communicating the information to ABC journalists. He was, at the time, acting for Timor-Leste in a dispute over the bugging operation at the permanent court of arbitration in The Hague.
"Says each year approximately 30,000 people in the United States die as a result of gunfire, and about 80,000 people are wounded."	Five children 15 and younger were among 23 people shot during a scorching weekend in Chicago. From Friday afternoon to early Monday, 21 people were wounded and two people were killed, including a 14-year-old boy who was shot early Saturday while walking in the Washington Park neighborhood, according to police. About nine hours earlier, another 14-year-old boy was shot in the Loop. He was coming up stairs at the corner of Wabash Avenue and Wacker Drive when he was shot in the leg Friday evening, police said. Late Sunday night, three girls ages 5, 14 and 15 were shot while sitting in a parked car with their mother in the East Garfield Park neighborhood, police said.
"In this city, there hasnt been a stadium thats lasted more than 27 years."	As they were looking around, they noticed a moose at the pond and they both said how amazing it would be if that was the backdrop to their wedding photos. Sure enough, just before the couple’s first kiss as husband and wife, they heard something behind them. ‘I start seeing guests kind of looking that way and I’m just wondering what the commotion is and I look over and I see people kind of moving really fast and I see a moose right there.’ Shandy said the moose seemed more curious than aggressive, but everyone, including the pastor, made sure to be cautious of their surroundings.”

Says Texas is last in mental health expenditures.	'We’re going to run different'
His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.

Says the Obama Administration has fulfilled all of Texas requests for fire management assisting grants.	— MINING: The EPA said last year that it won't require mining companies to prove they have the financial resources to clean up pollution, an Obama-era rule stemming from a long history of pollution spilling from abandoned mines into streams. Pruitt said modern mining practices and existing regulations made the financial requirement unnecessary and a burden on mining. — AUTOS: Pruitt's EPA has proposed freezing vehicle fuel-efficiency standards at 2020 levels for the next five years, according to a draft of the proposal obtained by Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del. For new vehicles, that means an average of about 30 miles per gallon instead of rising to 36 mpg by 2025 as Obama's EPA proposed. — OIL AND GAS: More than a dozen states are suing the EPA for failing to take action against leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, from oil and natural gas wells.
Says federal debt doubled during the Bush administration.	S&P 500 e-minis were down 4.5 points, or 0.16 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 15.5 points, or 0.22 percent. Meanwhile, investors awaited the U.S. jobs data for June, when employers likely maintained a brisk pace of hiring while increasing wages for workers. The Labor Department report, due at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to show nonfarm payrolls increased by 195,000 jobs last month, while average hourly earnings are expected to rise 0.3 percent. Just before the tariff deadline, President Donald Trump upped the ante, warning that the United States may ultimately target over $500 billion worth of Chinese goods, or roughly the total amount of U.S. imports from China last year.

Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.

XI ASSERTS TERRITORIAL CLAIMS IN MEETING WITH US DEFENSE SECRETARY
Chinese President Xi Jinping strongly asserted China's determination to defend territory it claims, including in the South China Sea, in a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. While the tone of Mattis' visit to Beijing was largely upbeat, Xi made sure to reinforce his reputation as a fervent nationalist when it comes to issues of sovereignty. Though Xi gave no specifics in his statement, he was largely seen as indicating the South China Sea as well as self-governing Taiwan. China also claims territory held by India and uninhabited East China Sea islands controlled by Japan.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

Trump’s reckless comments about Maxine Waters
If the unthinkable were to happen and Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., were injured in any way by an assailant, the situation must be squarely laid at the feet of the president of the United States. There isn’t much ambiguity about this, anyone can connect the dots.
ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi was released by Obama in 2009.	Russian forces loyal to dictator Bashar al-Assad killed the son of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the chief of the crumbling Islamic State, while he was hiding in a cave in Syria, Iraqi intelligence agents claimed Thursday. This week’s death of Hudhayfah al-Badri potentially deprives Baghdadi of an heir. Although they do not agree on the circumstances surrounding his death, Iraqi intelligence and Islamic State have confirmed that Hudhayfah al-Badri, Baghdadi’s son, is indeed dead. “The U.S. military said it had seen the reports of al-Badri’s death but declined any confirmation,” Voice of America conceded on Wednesday. Islamic State’s feeble presence in Iraq and Syria, once home to its now annihilated so-called caliphate, has been squeezed into ever-shrinking pockets of territory mainly located along the border dividing the two countries.
The NRA used to support expanded background checks.	Last June witnessed 1,901,768 checks, which was the second best June on record until this year. Background check numbers have been increasing in the wake of the gun control push that followed the Parkland school shooting. That horrific shooting occurred on February 14, 2018, and Breitbart News reported that March, April, and May 2018 all broke records for the most background checks in their respective months. Membership in gun rights’ organizations has surged since the Parkland shooting as well. The NRA now has six million members and the Second Amendment Foundation (SAF) witnessed a 1,200% increase in members aged 18-20.
Going to public financing really disadvantages Democrats because you're not able to raise funds between the day you win the primaries and the time you're officially nominated.	Hamilton, the Republican state lawmaker who beat the incumbent Karnes, won with a mix of support from teachers and other unions. While Karnes sparred with teachers during the strike, Hamilton took a moderate position. He aligned with teachers unions by opposing state right-to-work legislation and the proposed repeal of prevailing wage laws for public construction projects. The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.

This was particularly an issue for Pruitt’s former executive scheduler Sydney Hupp, who often had to shell out for Pruitt’s trips. Hupp was also asked by Pruitt to speak with staff at one of Trump’s hotels, believing he could get a deal on a second-hand mattress they were selling. Pruitt remained miserly even when he was abusing his position to get a good deal. He fell behind on the rental payments on the condo he was getting on the cheap and eventually had to be evicted and the locks were changed.

For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.
The war in Iraq was a major factor in blowing the top off the price of oil.	The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks picked up 1.1 percent to 1,679.48.

In an exchange that lasted around five minutes, McMaster and others took turns explaining to Trump how military action could backfire and risk losing hard-won support among Latin American governments to punish President Nicolas Maduro for taking Venezuela down the path of dictatorship, according to the official. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the discussions. Although he gave no indication he was about to order up military plans, he pointed to what he considered past cases of successful gunboat diplomacy in the region, according to the official, like the invasions of Panama and Grenada in the 1980s.

Not surprisingly, the split was along partisan lines: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. There was bipartisan agreement on one thing: Across party lines, roughly seven in 10 agree with the statement, "I feel fatigued watching the news." Elsewhere in politics

Sharron Angle would eliminate the Department of Education.	Schools will be replaced, on an acting basis, by Bradley Weinsheimer, who currently works in the national security unit. Weinsheimer has spent 27 years at DOJ, where he tried homicide and public corruption cases. Unlike Schools, Weinsheimer will not supervise or otherwise be involved in overseeing the special counsel team probing Russian election interference and whether any Americans tied to the Trump campaign took part.

On whether BPs $20 billion fund to compensate oil spill victims is a slush fund.	LONDON, July 2 (Reuters) - China’s yuan fell to its lowest level against the U.S. dollar since mid-August on Monday, as investors become increasingly worries a growing trade conflict between Beijing and Washington will squeeze the Chinese economy. The yuan, traded in offshore markets, fell 0.9 percent on the day, its biggest one-day drop since January 2017, to 6.6925 yuan per dollar. The Chinese currency suffered its worst ever month against the dollar in June, and is now down almost 5 percent since the middle of last month. Chinese stocks have also taken a battering, with the Shanghai bourse hitting over two-year lows in an ominous start to July, days before U.S. tariffs on Chinese exports are due to take effect. The dollar is also rallying broadly and is up 0.5 percent on the day against a basket of currencies.
On in-state tuition for illegal immigrants.	Not providing the same enhanced Central opportunities at South has led to a diminishing student population, and less demand for housing at South versus the opposite effect at Central. A significant positive remedy to the filed discrimination complaint would include a one campus system: one campus for freshmen and sophomores, and the other campus for juniors and seniors. Will the board of education continue to allow socioeconomic and racial discrimination and segregation, or unify both resident and student populations? The impartial answer is unification. However, the elitist population of District 86 will negatively resist any such answer.
Says Jacky Rosen has refused to tell us whether she supports Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton.	The report also said that Strzok repeatedly pushed for more aggressive action in the Clinton probe. "The conduct by these employees cast a cloud over the entire FBI investigation and sowed doubt about the FBI’s work," the report concluded. "The damage caused by these employees’ actions extends far beyond the scope of the (Clinton) investigation and goes to the heart of the FBI’s reputation for neutral fact finding and political independence." Goelman, in an op-ed in USA TODAY last month, said Strzok has become the victim of "political gamesmanship" by Congress and President Trump, who has repeatedly tweeted about Strzok as evidence of bias by the FBI and Justice Department. "They have spent months cynically taking these texts out of context and saying that one- or two-word snippets somehow prove that the FBI investigations of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the Russia probe itself, were biased," Goelman wrote.
The five economic indicators that the federal government tracks - for the first time since August 2006 - were positive this October.	That came on the heels of 0.9 percent drop in March, the first monthly drop since July of 2017. Total private construction rose 0.3 percent, with residential projects up 0.8 percent in May. New single-family home construction rose 0.6 percent and the volatile apartment building sector jumped 1.6 percent. Private, non-residential building fell 0.3 percent. Economists are forecasting that construction spending will contribute to overall growth this year even though interest rates are rising.

"In slashing $1.7 billion from Social Security, Rep. Jim Renacci may end up forcing the entire agency to ... shut down for a month, causing seniors to not get their benefits on time, halting claims processing, and forcing new retirees and disabled workers into a backlog."	Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
"Says Sen. Bill Nelson voted to spend $144,541 to see how monkeys react under the influence of cocaine."	Corporate America couldn’t hire Republican lobbyists fast enough after President Donald Trump’s election gave the GOP unified control of Washington. Now there are signs that Democrats are back in demand. Companies and trade groups are trying to hire congressional staffers with ties to influential House Democrats four months ahead of the midterm elections, in which Democrats are expected to pick up seats and potentially retake control of the House. Lobbyists are helping their clients meet with the Democrats who would become committee chairs if the party does win back the chamber. And trade groups are talking to members about what to expect from a Democratic takeover.

The big exception was during this election he realized astutely that no one can win by himself. He has built a large coalition that includes a far-right party completely opposed to progressive politics. He has done so because he needed them to win. How will he behave toward those members of his very odd coalition is anyone’s guess.
Says(President) Reagans second inaugural was moved inside the Capitol. It was. Because of a terrible snowstorm.	There is reason to believe that might happen. The foundation, in conjunction with UIC, recently held its Chicago Community Conversation on the West Side. The event at UIC drew nearly 350 community activists, representing a broad range of interests, to exchange ideas about some of the city’s most pressing issues. Like most foundation forums, it was a spectacular event, drawing everyone from MacArthur Foundation “genius grant” winner Rami Nashashibi to philanthropic organizations to Tony- and Grammy-winning performer Daveed Diggs. Notably absent, though, was Obama.
"Says a poll shows that without a name attached, Democrats are just one point behind Gov. John Kasich."	The nonpartisan Cook Political Report says Democrats are "likely" to carry Montana in the Senate race. Inside Elections rates the contest as one that "tilts Democratic." After the rally, the spokesman for Tester's re-election campaign put out a statement that was critical of Rosendale but which did not mention the president. "Jon's record is clear—if it's good for Montana, Jon works with anyone from either party to get things done. If it's bad for Montana, he'll stand up to anyone," Tester spokesman Chris Meagher said.

Pruitt said modern mining practices and existing regulations made the financial requirement unnecessary and a burden on mining. — AUTOS: Pruitt's EPA has proposed freezing vehicle fuel-efficiency standards at 2020 levels for the next five years, according to a draft of the proposal obtained by Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del. For new vehicles, that means an average of about 30 miles per gallon instead of rising to 36 mpg by 2025 as Obama's EPA proposed. — OIL AND GAS: More than a dozen states are suing the EPA for failing to take action against leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, from oil and natural gas wells.

The commissioner added a Capitol trooper "actually put him out with his fire extinguisher."
We spend almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country.	Dec. 7, 2016: Trump announces that Pruitt will be his nominee for EPA administrator
The then-Attorney General of Oklahoma was touted by Trump as having "great qualifications and a good record." Part of that record was Pruitt touting himself as a "leading advocate against the EPA's activist agenda," and his history of challenging the EPA was well known. Feb. 17, 2017: Confirmed by the Senate
Pruitt's confirmation, which was approved with a vote of 52-46, came in the midst of a court order that required him to turn over thousands of communications with major coal, oil and gas companies from his time in office. Democratic senators expressed outrage that Republicans were going ahead as scheduled with the vote on Pruitt, despite the judge’s ruling in the order. March 23, 2017: Defends budget cuts to his agency
The budget plan put forward by the Trump administration proposed cuts 31 percent of the EPA’s funding, including significant reductions to research programs and enforcement of clean air and clean water programs, but that didn’t bother Pruitt.

"Says Bruce Starr voted to throw 6,000 Oregonians off unemployment."	He aligned himself with most of his Democratic colleagues against Gina Haspel, Trump's pick for CIA director, arguing that her record on enhanced interrogation techniques was unacceptable. And instead of focusing on a politically safe issue in his maiden Senate floor speech, Jones struck a nerve by calling for a dialogue on gun violence after the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida. In addition, during the campaign, Jones made no secret of his desire to protect LGBTQ rights and to support a woman's right to abortion. It's those kinds of positions that have made him a darling of Alabama's progressive minority — and somewhat of a public enemy among the state's conservative majority. Jones has introduced four pieces of legislation — none of any huge significance — since he arrived on Capitol Hill, including two agriculture bills, one that would expand access to capital for rural job creators and the last seeking to mandate an annual Medicaid expansion review.
We need to pass a carbon tax to stop climate change. Break up the Wall Street banks. And stop the government spying on innocent Americans. Cory Booker doesnt support any of these ideas.	Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.
"Says while serving in the city council, Rachel Zenzinger voted to use tax dollars to take a taxpayer-funded junket to China."	“Some of these articles feature exaggerations or overgeneraliszations [sic]; for example, some claim that China is ‘world No.1’ in certain field.”
The problem with these pieces, the People’s Daily argued in this column, is that “they lack basic facts and deep thought.”
Should Xi implement this reform in the tone of Chinese state media, it would mean a significant change for the typical styles of the nation’s largest publications. In 2017 alone, Chinese state publications proclaimed that the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse scandal proves that “Chinese traditional values” are superior to Western ones; the Soviet Union failed because it lacked “Chinese culture”; and that the West was doomed to fail because Western leaders “always believe in absolute conquest.”
An extensive profile of Xi Jinping in the state outlet Xinhua last year also went out of its way to proclaim that the world is riveted by Xi and his ability to “make things happen,” as evidenced by the “numerous clicks and many thumbs-up on the Internet” his speeches and political commentary garner. The story featured an anecdote about a man who drank some of the ink he was using to translate the Communist Manifesto because “the taste of truth is so sweet.”
Not to be left behind, in December, the People’s Daily proclaimed, “A unique path, a unique theory, a unique system, a unique culture; Xi Jinping’s thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era has developed a rich path for China that has transcended Western-centric theory.”
The growing human rights movement within China has also become one of the most common targets of vitriol for state media. Shortly following the death of Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo last year, the Global Times called Liu and his supporters “losers” and dismissed their lives as a “waste.”
The People’s Daily message this week may be aimed for North Korea as much as it is for China, as Pyongyang prepares for what appears to be inevitable economic profit following dictator Kim Jong-un’s in-person meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. North Korean state media are more vitriolic and exaggerated than their Chinese counterpart, spending much of 2017 threatening a nuclear attack on the United States and sentencing Trump to death.
"The governor is trying to take credit for recent actions taken by these companies. The problem is that for all three companies, the decision to move or stay in New Jersey happened before Chris Christie became governor."

He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers.

"Says more than 1 million Texans are jobless, the state has its highest unemployment rate in more than 20 years and joblessness doubled on Rick Perrys watch."	'We’re going to run different'
His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.

"East Coast developer Matt Rosendale is only looking out for himself and whatever out-of-state special interest group that is propping up his campaign with cash. We can't trust him to defend Montana." But before Trump arrived in Montana, Tester's campaign took out full-page ads in newspapers across the state, highlighting bills the senator sponsored that Trump has signed into law.
"Canada ""does spills into their water to practice in the event that this would happen. That is not allowed in the United States."""	There are fewer than 450 North Atlantic right whales left in the world, and Canada is under international pressure to step up protection of the species, after 12 of the animals were killed last year in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence – many of them in collisions with ships and some after becoming tangled in fishing gear. Scientists believe climate change is causing the species to shift its feeding grounds into the Gulf, putting it on a collision course with the shipping and fishing industries.

"The geography of poverty has changed fundamentally in the last 15 years, with more of it concentrated in fragile and conflict states."	Despite decades of UN and government aid, 38% of the population lived in extreme poverty. Social workers proposed new a new approach. Puente al Desarrollo – A Bridge to Development – is human rights-based legislation that has seen government agencies and communities coming together to address social problems – and support people in meeting their aspirations. The new law applies a social work approach of responding to all the issues that contribute to poverty and strengthening community systems of self-care.

"Russia has tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads 1,800, by the way where they expanded, and we didnt."	Pentagon Questioned Over Blackout On War Zone Troop Numbers

For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.
"For every dollar we invest in Head Start, we get $5 to $7 back into our economy."	The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives. At first there was talk about a much bigger pot of money -- $100 million or more. When the bill was reintroduced this year, the amount was $20 million. By the end of the legislative session, it was down to $5 million.

The stimulus created zero jobs.	If Seehofer does step down, it was not immediately clear what effect the move would have on a three-week impasse between Merkel and her Bavarian-only CSU partners, which has centered on his resolve to turn away some types of asylum-seekers at Germany's borders. Merkel has insisted on Europe-wide solutions to handling the waves of desperate foreigners trying to reach the continent and the standoff could spell the end of her fourth government. Merkel insisted earlier Sunday that a plan to regulate immigration European Union leaders approved Friday and agreements she hashed out with several key countries would accomplish what Seehofer seeks. "The sum total of everything we have agreed upon has the same effect" as what Seehofer has demanded, Merkel said in an interview with ZDF television. "That is my personal opinion.

The NHS will consume 66% of the Welsh budget by 2048 if demand increases in line with predicted demand, according to new research. Health economist Prof Ceri Phillips said spending on the NHS would need to rise by 4% a year. Currently £6bn out of a total Welsh budget of £14.5bn goes to the NHS. The Welsh Government said its Health and Social Care Plan aimed to reduce demand through more people managing their own health and well-being. BBC Wales Investigates had asked Prof Phillips, from Swansea University, to question existing projections for healthcare in Wales and then calculate how much extra spending would be needed to keep the NHS afloat.

Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups. According to the New York Times, the Supreme court’s decision will affect these left-wing groups and causes. “If the progressive movement is a navy, they’re trying to take out our aircraft carriers,” said Ben Wikler, of MoveOn.org, the Times reported. However, progressive groups are optimistic that the loss of union funds will be compensated for with grass-roots activism.

Trump was equally tactful, telling reporters: “I think he’s going to try and help us with the border. “I think the relationship will be a very good one,” the US president said of the Mexican politician, whose swearing-in will be in December. “We talked about trade, we talked about Nafta, we talked about a separate deal, just Mexico and the United States.”
Such restraint contrasted with Trump’s call to López Obrador’s predecessor, weeks after his inauguration last year.
"Since I took office, over 319,000 new private sector jobs have been created in Georgia with nearly 93,000 of those coming in the past 12 months."

The gain was better than many economists had been expecting and depicts an overall economy that appears to be regaining momentum after a slowdown in the winter.
And it's going to be difficult for us to do this as long as we're spending $275 million a day on a war that should have never been authorized...	In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners.

President Trump has just said in the past week he's going to raise things like Syria, like Ukraine, like the election meddling issue, really the whole range of issues between us. And I think that, in the president's mind, this is very important, because it gives him an opportunity to size up Vladimir Putin, to see where there are areas where we might make progress together and where there are areas where we may not.

For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.

Meanwhile, other media personalities have faced kidnappings, arrests and physical abuse by mysterious hooded men who no journalist dare name - but every journalist in the country is convinced belong to the military intelligence agencies. But after maintaining months of silence as to what it has endured, or what exactly the military's complaints are, Dawn recently published a frank and stinging editorial. The editorial describes its important, factual reporting about the serious rift between civil and military authorities during the Nawaz Sharif government, which had infuriated the military, and Dawn's insistence on protecting the sources for its stories - a basic element of media ethics worldwide. The editorial states that "a campaign of disinformation, libel and slander, hate and virtual incitement to violence against Dawn and its staff has necessitated placing certain matters on record". It added that elements "within or sections of the state" are not upholding constitutional freedoms.
"President Obama's own director of national intelligence, Admiral Blair, put it this way: 'High-value information came from interrogations in which those methods were used and provided a deeper understanding of the al-Qaida organization that was attacking this country.'"	The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee is calling for 10 government officials who served at the State Department or White House during the Obama administration to testify in Congress about the Russia probe as he investigates possible government surveillance abuse during the 2016 election. In a Monday letter to a pair of congressional committees, Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., asked the Oversight and Judiciary Committees to take steps to interview former State Department officials Elizabeth Dibble, Jonathan Finer, Kathleen Kavalec, Lewis Lukens, Victoria Nuland, Thomas Williams and Jonathan Winer, as well as former Obama White House officials Jake Sullivan, Colin Kahl and Shailagh Murray. Dibble, the former deputy chief of mission at the U.S. embassy in London, a city where other figures in the Russia investigation were operating. Winer, a former Obama State Department official, has acknowledged he had regular contact with ex-British spy Christopher Steele, the author of the controversial anti-Trump dossier. Steele’s dossier was at the heart of the controversial memo released this year by Nunes alleging that the FBI sought a surveillance warrant for a Trump associate based in large part on that dossier, without fully revealing that the research had been funded by Democratic sources.
"When he (Donald Trump) asked Florida to have casino gambling, we said no."	A senior Pentagon official during the Obama administration, Denmark worries that with President Trump's suspension of a major military exercise with South Korea next month, North Korea's already gotten a lot and given up very little. "Kim Jong Un did not make any new commitments in Singapore, and so the secretary of state is now forced to go into Pyongyang, trying to secure something that the president was not able to," says Denmark. "The real question is whether Kim Jong Un is genuinely interested in denuclearization." Trump, for one, apparently thinks he is. "I made a deal with him.

"When Sen. Edwards ran in 2004, he wasn't for universal health care. I'm glad he is now."	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”

Says Mike Huckabee appeared in diabetes infomercials to endorse cures and treatments that no health agency supports.	There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void. In New Jersey, this is compounded by the fact that the state is located between two big cities, New York and Philadelphia, that are in other states. The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.
"Says EPA regulation of greenhouse gases will endanger 575 Texas dairy facilities, 58 swine operations, 1,300 corn farms and 28,000 beef cattle operations."	President Trump had suggested lifting the prohibition, which environmentalists charge would raise levels of ground ozone during warmer months, during his campaign for the White House. Following the news of Mr. Pruitt’s resignation, Mr. Dinneen wrote that there was a “collective sigh of relief coming from the Midwest,” calling the 2019 ethanol quotas “the straw that broke the camel’s back.”
While it is too early to say how the handling of waivers or the treatment of E15 may change under new leadership, one indicator was small losses in affected refiners in early Friday trading and gains in most ethanol producers.

Facebook has unveiled new rules to stop their users from creatingposts related in any way to religion.	The committee said on its website that it received the responses shortly before midnight on Friday; the deadline for the responses was the close of business Friday. It is Facebook’s second attempt at answering Congress’s queries. In June, Facebook delivered 450 pages of answers to two Senate committees, deflecting some questions about its influence and market power while offering some detail about the information it collects on users. Facebook has been under scrutiny since March when revelations surfaced that political analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, which aided President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, purchased data on 87 million users without their consent. In the ensuing hearings, lawmakers asked Mr. Zuckerberg whether Facebook was in violation of a settlement the company made in 2012 with the Federal Trade Commission, under which the company is required to give its users clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before sharing their information beyond their privacy settings.

John Burbank of the Economic Opportunity Institute said there is a a direct link between the surge in highly paid jobs and the numbers of people forced on to the street. “There’s an incredible correlation between the increase in homelessness and the increase in the number of people who have incomes in excess of $250,000,” he said. “That has grown by almost 50% between 2011 and 2017.

As motorists pay more to fill their tanks this Independence Day -- with gas prices at a four-year high for the holiday -- safety advocates are urging caution during celebrations that turn deadly on U.S. roadways. The national average for a gallon of gas on Tuesday stood at $2.86, making it the costliest for an Independence Day holiday in four years, according to AAA. That said, the nearly 40 million motorists expected to travel this week will pay 11 cents less per gallon at the pump than they did this past Memorial Day holiday, the motorist club noted. "The national gas price average has held fairly steady for the past 10 days, suggesting that U.S. demand is keeping pace with supply and stabilizing summer gas prices," a spokesperson for the motorist group said in a statement. "However, elevated crude oil prices and other geopolitical concerns could tilt gas prices more expensive in the early fall despite an expected increase in global crude production from OPEC and its partners."

XI ASSERTS TERRITORIAL CLAIMS IN MEETING WITH US DEFENSE SECRETARY
Chinese President Xi Jinping strongly asserted China's determination to defend territory it claims, including in the South China Sea, in a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. While the tone of Mattis' visit to Beijing was largely upbeat, Xi made sure to reinforce his reputation as a fervent nationalist when it comes to issues of sovereignty. Though Xi gave no specifics in his statement, he was largely seen as indicating the South China Sea as well as self-governing Taiwan. China also claims territory held by India and uninhabited East China Sea islands controlled by Japan.

People think AIDS is done --its not done.	An interactive online HIV prevention program has reduced the sexually transmitted infection rates of gonorrhea and chlamydia by 40 percent among young gay and bisexual men, the first such approach to show an impact on sexual health, a new study found.

The program targets men 18 to 29 who have sex with men, a group that is disproportionately affected by HIV infections in the U.S. While this group represents only 2 percent of all young people, it accounts for 70 percent of HIV diagnoses according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Keep It Up!” is made up of different modules involving interactive games, exercises, a simulation at a bar and a soap opera.

On this much police and activist South Side priest Michael Pfleger can agree: Saturday morning’s anti-violence march on the Dan Ryan Expressway is all about danger. Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday he thinks the federal government can’t do much to help stop school shootings. “I don’t think at the federal level there’s much that we can do other than appropriate funds,” McConnell said while speaking to community leaders in Danville, Kentucky, the Lexington Herald-Leader reports. McConnell said he feels heightened security in schools may help prevent shootings but argued that’s not the responsibility of the U.S. Congress. “You would think, given how much it takes to get on an American plane or given how much it takes to get into courthouses, that this might be something that we could achieve, but I don’t think we could do that from Washington, I think it’s basically a local decision,” he said. “It’s a darn shame that’s where we are, but this epidemic is something that’s got all of our attention,” he added.

In their statement, Mr Netanyahu and Mr Morawiecki praised the Polish wartime government-in-exile, saying it tried to "raise awareness among Western allies of the systematic murder" of Polish Jews. They also said structures of the Polish underground state supervised by the Polish government-in-exile "created a mechanism of systematic help and support to Jewish people". However Yad Vashem said this contradicted decades of historical research and contained "grave errors and deceptions". It said much of the Polish resistance in its various movements "not only failed to help Jews, but was also not infrequently actively involved in persecuting them".

The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.
Florida has issued more than 3 million conceal carry permits in the past 30 years. Only 168 have been revoked.	“I was defending myself,” Sumpter said during the hearing. Judge John Blawie told Sumpter that he believed his version of events, but had to follow the letter of the law. Under Connecticut law, assault victims cannot use deadly force if they are able to retreat from their attackers. By contrast, 27 states — most notably Florida — have passed so-called “stand-your-ground” laws, which entitle citizens to use force in self-defense if there is a reasonable belief of a threat.

"For every one job created under the Obama administration, 75 people went on food stamps."	The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) spent a total of $4 billion on improper food stamp payments to those receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the USDA confirmed with Breitbart News on Friday. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service announced this week that improper payments made up 6.3 percent of SNAP money in the fiscal year (FY) 2017—the latest data available from the agency. Breitbart News analyzed the USDA’s data on food stamp spending and found that $4,007,026,532 of the $63,603,595,754 the agency spent on SNAP in FY 2017 went to improper payments. The USDA told Breitbart News that “it is important to note that improper payments include both overpayments and underpayments,” meaning that households on SNAP that received less than what they were supposed to receive for the month are also included in the percentage rate. Brandon Lipps, the Acting Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services at the agency, said that most improper payments are due to “human errors”—either because of state agencies miscalculating benefits or benefit recipients giving state agencies the wrong information.
"Says that after she declared her candidacy for Congress, the redistricting process was manipulated to allow incumbent politicians to guarantee their re-election."	CLACKAMAS, Ore. -- A black Oregon lawmaker says one of her constituents called police as she canvassed a Portland-area neighborhood that she represents. State Rep. Janelle Bynum, who is running for re-election this fall, said she was knocking on doors, talking to residents and taking notes on her cellphone in Clackamas on Tuesday when a Clackamas County sheriff's deputy showed up. Bynum said the deputy told her a woman called police because the lawmaker appeared to spend a long time at homes and appeared to be casing the neighborhood while on her phone, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. The deputy asked if she was selling something, and she introduced herself as a state legislator and told him she was canvassing, Bynum said. She said she only had campaign fliers, her cellphone and a pen on her.

Says Bush Jr. handed Obama a $1.4 trillion deficit and Obama reduced Bush Jr.s deficit to just $492 billion.	The U.S. trade deficit dropped in May to the lowest level in 19 months as U.S. exports rose to a record level. But the trade gap between the United States and China increased sharply, underscoring the economic tensions between the world's two biggest economies. The Commerce Department says the May trade deficit — the difference between what America sells and what it buys in foreign markets — fell 6.6 percent to $43.1 billion. It was the smallest imbalance since October 2016. Exports climbed 1.9 percent to a record $215.3 billion.

Young estimates that around two-thirds of his union members were Trump supporters. That makes sense: It’s a law enforcement agency that leans white and male (72 percent male, 62 percent white), and many federal prisons are in rural parts of the country, which Trump dominated. But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau. BOP has long suffered the kind of problems you’d expect for a massive bureaucracy centered on caging tens of thousands of people.

The UK is leaving the EU in March 2019, but has yet to agree how it will trade with the remaining EU members - who are part of a single market and a customs union - in years to come. Some former Remain campaigners want the government to pursue close ties to the EU to avoid barriers to trade with Europe - but Eurosceptics say the UK needs freedom to set its own independent trade policy. After two alternative models for customs were criticised, Downing Street has come up with what it calls a "third way" solution to be presented on Friday, claiming it will offer "the best of both worlds" - frictionless trade with Europe and the freedom to strike international trade deals.

Jeff Burke, APS director of resources planning, says customers would see 6 to 14 percent per year increases on their bills if the company is forced to ratchet up renewable use ahead of schedule. "We continue to add renewables to our system, but they have to make sense," Burke said. "It's not really about a target, it's about what makes sense for our customers' usage and what makes rates affordable and what keeps our system reliable." Thirty-two states with renewable standards didn't have, on average, a correlated rate increase, according to Wesley Hersche, an associate director of research with Arizona State University's Global Security Initiative. "These issues involve a complex interaction of factors, and we should be careful not to oversimplify things," Hersche wrote in April.

"Under Ryan plan,those 54 and younger would receive the same kind of healthcare options now enjoyed by members of Congress."	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”

The government will appoint a national LGBT health adviser and take measures to end so-called conversion therapy as part of a plan to deliver what Theresa May has promised will be “real and lasting change”. The proposals form part of an action plan published by the Equalities Office on Tuesday. It follows a UK-wide survey of LGBT people that had more than 108,000 responses, billed as the largest study of its kind. The 30-page plan contains a series of pledges, including to improve the police response to LGBT hate incidents, more support for LGBT students and teachers and improvements to gender identity services for transgender adults. The proposals, which will receive an initial £4.5m in funding, were welcomed by the campaign groups Stonewall and the LGBT Foundation.
David Dewhurst is the first lieutenant governor in history to have a personal security detail.	In the four days since he was elected, he has repeatedly said he didn't want bodyguards and that "the people will protect me." He has also said the crowd of press also serves to protect him, but complained half-jokingly about the crush of journalists that accompany him everywhere — even interviewing him from motorcycles that shadow his car's every move. He said Thursday: "I would like a little, just a little bit, of privacy."

In turn, that means American firms in China could soon find their new product models at the bottom of the regulatory pile for things like safety approvals, or their state-owned Chinese partners might shift resources toward European joint ventures instead.

Tax marijuana sales with a 10 percent excise tax at the retail level as well as the state's 6 percent sales tax. Split those revenues, with 35 percent going to K-12 education, 35 percent to roads, 15 percent to the communities that allow marijuana businesses in their communities and 15 percent to counties where marijuana business are located. Allow communities to decide whether they’ll allow marijuana businesses in their towns.

"Says Ted Cruz has pledged to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education, which would end federal aid to college students."	Breitbart News reported in April 2017 that the major Missouri institution would close a total of seven residential buildings. “Historically every year between now and August, various situations occur that result in position openings, e.g. normal attrition and voluntary staff choices, as well as unplanned academic or personal challenges,” the university said in a statement. “If necessary, we will offer alternative employment opportunities at comparable compensation to the remaining staff.”
Several years later, the university is still facing a crisis. According to new reports, the University of Missouri is currently facing a $49 million budget shortfall. Additionally, the university has laid off 30 employees and eliminated 155 vacant positions.

The number of predominantly Christian people killed in Nigeria by Muslim Fulani terrorists in the first six months of this year has dwarfed the fatalities carried out by the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL)-affiliated Boko Haram, a non-governmental organization (NGO) based in the African country revealed this week. In one weekend last month (June 23 and 24), the Fulani stormed nearly a dozen Christian-majority villages in Nigeria’s Plateau state, using machetes and firearms to massacre at least 200 people, including women and children. Referring to the Plateau incident in an article published by Nigeria’s Daily Post, the NGO, known as the International Society for Civil Liberties and the Rule of Law (Intersociety), noted Monday that the fatalities from the Fulani massacre could reach 300, making it one of the deadliest by any group in Nigeria. Intersociety explains:
The total death toll in Plateau State following the 23rd and 24th June 2018 coordinated attacks and killings in eleven villages may most likely have hit 300, from its present 250, out of which 218 bodies have been recovered and buried in mass graves. The activists on the ground said dozens of people are still missing after the head count was carried out.

For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan.

The study shows the complexity of the the opioid crisis, according to Josiah Rich, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Brown University, who wasn't involved in the research.
Says Democratic Senate candidate Bruce Braley voted to cut $700 billion from Medicare to support Obamacare.	"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.

"1928 was last time Republicans had the White House, the House and the Senate."	The Republican Party is rotting away. The problem is that GOP policies just aren’t popular. Most Americans unsurprisingly oppose climate denial, tax cuts for the wealthy, and putting children (including toddlers) in concentration camps, for example. The Republican Party has thus far managed to continue winning elections by creating “a coalition between racists and plutocrats,” as Paul Krugman put it. The party’s economic policies are aimed at benefitting wealthy individuals and corporations, but that’s a slim segment of the American electorate.

U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss votes more with Democrats than with conservatives.	That's more than all but three Democratic senators (Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana), all of whom are from red states and facing re-election this fall. "I think he's terrific," Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., who also faces a tough re-election fight, said in an interview. "It's harder work when you're not interested in voting the party line. You've got to look at every issue from all sides." "I really have been pleasantly surprised how willing he is to tell Chuck Schumer to go fly a kite," she added, referring to the Senate minority leader.

Says the recall elections that aimed to remove him and other Republican officials from office cost tens of millions of dollars to run.	Teddy Roosevelt hopped on whistle stop tour after whistle stop tour where he was able to drop into rural and suburban communities alike to deliver short, pre-packaged speeches that local papers would usually print verbatim. (He left them short on purpose for that very reason.) Franklin Roosevelt revolutionized and heightened the stature of the office with his fireside chats, that brought his message over the heads of the pesky press corps and directly into the living rooms of the American people. But, though it would have been seen as a scoop, even the reporters covering Lyndon B. Johnson had the good sense not to report on every turd he dropped in their presence. While the founders envisioned a government that moved slowly and methodically, today’s Wi-Fi-enabled political discourse is demanding the opposite.
"In Wisconsin, only half of all the adults with serious psychological distress received mental health treatment or medication."	"People who use opioids, including heroin, were up to 13 times more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system," says Winkelman. The study shows the complexity of the the opioid crisis, according to Josiah Rich, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Brown University, who wasn't involved in the research. It shows "the spectrum of the disease and its overlap with the criminal justice system, showing that the more you progress along that continuum, the more likely you are to get tangled up in the criminal justice system." The study also showed that most people with opioid use disorder had other mental illnesses and were also more likely to have certain chronic health conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The study authors argue for the need to engage and involve the criminal justice system in dealing with the opioid epidemic, including reducing overdose deaths.
She stood by ground zero workers who sacrificed their health after so many sacrificed their lives and kept standing till this administration took action.	"I told them how I was feeling, but they didn’t listen to me." There were no beds, so Rosa laid on the floor.

"On gift taking,Bob McDonnell took a fraction of what (Tim) Kaine took."	Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
This is the first time since World War II that five nuclear-powered aircraft carriers were docked together.	According to a Russian state media report related by Turkey’s Hurriyet Daily News , the United States is planning to send next-generation B61 nuclear gravity bombs to NATO bases in several European countries, including Turkey. The bomb is said to be compatible with F-35 joint strike fighters, which Turkey is also due to receive amid some controversy. Hurriyet describes the B61 nuclear bomb and Russia’s sour reaction to the prospect of NATO bases receiving them:
The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) and the U.S. Air Force completed two non-nuclear system qualification flight tests of the B61-12 gravity bomb on June 9 at Tonopah Test Range in Nevada, according to a June 29 statement by DOE/NNSA. The test, which was reportedly the first of its kind, was aimed at extending the B61 bomb’s service life by adapting it to next generation aircraft, including B-2A Spirit Bomber. “The B61-12 LEP will consolidate and replace the existing B61 bomb variants in the [U.S.] nuclear stockpile.

Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left a demoralized agency where staff fear their ability to protect public health is diminished
Scott Pruitt is out but his impact on the environment will be felt for years
Scott Pruitt, who has finally stepped down as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency after a long-rumbling corruption scandal, rose to public prominence on the back of a series of increasingly outlandish ethical controversies. Scott Pruitt resigns: Trump's scandal-ridden EPA chief steps down Read more
From lobbying fast food company Chick-fil-A on behalf of his wife, to demanding his staff acquire a mattress from a Trump Hotel – not to mention the millions of taxpayer dollars spent on security, first-class travel and soundproof booths – Pruitt’s behavior clashed spectacularly with any pretense of Trump’s pledge to “drain the swamp” in Washington. But the lasting legacy of the former Oklahoma attorney general – who was picked by Trump after crusading against what he called the EPA’s “activist agenda” – is likely to be felt in the systematic weakening of environmental regulations. While not as eye-catching as, for example, his demand that his official vehicle use sirens so he could reach a French restaurant on time, Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left behind a demoralized agency where staff fret that their ability to protect public health has been diminished. A staunch ally of oil and gas companies, Pruitt stacked EPA advisory boards with industry representatives and sought to set aside whole troves of research that link pollution to various illnesses.
"By voting to approve [Question 1], we can . . . save 900 jobs at Twin River."	Many high-priced commercial parcels were under-assessed, pushing more of the tax burden onto smaller businesses and homeowners, the series concluded. Berrios’ office disputes that there are problems with commercial property assessments, the consultants haven’t been asked to work on the issue, and County Board President Toni Preckwinkle has said it would have to be addressed later. Kaegi, who is poised to take office in early December, said the issue “is something that we’re going to take a very close look at from the outset.” Tax hike coming? The assessor’s office conducts a major reassessment of all properties in the county over a three-year period, dividing up the geography by the north suburbs, south suburbs and the city.

"Says U.S. Senate rival Tommy Thompson wants to give a new $265,000 tax cut to millionaires like himself while raising taxes on the middle class."	3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

Says Obama replaced the American flag on the tail of his plane with his campaign logo.	Cult activities escalated after the defeat of Aum members in the 1990 parliamentary election. During their bizarre election campaign, Asahara and his top disciples sang and danced to the guru's songs. In June 1994, the cult spread sarin gas in Matsumoto in central Japan, killing eight people and injuring more than 140 others, in an attack targeting residents who were protesting the cult's presence in their neighborhood and court officials handling their legal disputes. Nakagawa and key members produced sarin at a cult compound and sprayed it from a van, in what was later regarded as an experiment for the subsequent subway gassing. Under intensifying scrutiny from the government, the cult plotted the larger sarin attack on the subways in Tokyo on March 20, 1995.
Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed held not one conversation with the public about the new Falcons stadium project	"The possibility that these two investigations might be linked is clearly a line of inquiry for us," he said late Wednesday night. Initially, the investigation was led by local police, but Basu said counterterrorism detectives were taking charge after the substance was identified as Novichok. He said 100 officers had been assigned to the case. Police said officers were initially called Saturday morning about a collapsed woman, then were summoned back in the evening after a man fell ill at the same property. Police at first thought the two had taken a contaminated batch of heroin or crack.

The only two (Donald Trump tax returns) we have show that he hasnt paid a penny in taxes.	Three of the teens were named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit. Howard told U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Dillon during a status conference Tuesday that all three original plaintiffs are no longer part of the case. But he said another teen "is anxious to participate in the case" and will be named as a new plaintiff. "We believe that his allegations with respect to his experience at the facility are sufficiently analogous ... to those of John Does Nos. 1, 2 and 3," Howard said.
"In a budget deal struck in 2011 a trillion dollars of cuts went into effect immediately, and then a special committee was set up ... to get agreement on another $3 trillion of cuts."	Dec. 7, 2016: Trump announces that Pruitt will be his nominee for EPA administrator
The then-Attorney General of Oklahoma was touted by Trump as having "great qualifications and a good record." Part of that record was Pruitt touting himself as a "leading advocate against the EPA's activist agenda," and his history of challenging the EPA was well known. Feb. 17, 2017: Confirmed by the Senate
Pruitt's confirmation, which was approved with a vote of 52-46, came in the midst of a court order that required him to turn over thousands of communications with major coal, oil and gas companies from his time in office. Democratic senators expressed outrage that Republicans were going ahead as scheduled with the vote on Pruitt, despite the judge’s ruling in the order. March 23, 2017: Defends budget cuts to his agency

"If you're a small business and don't ""adopt the health care plan that Senator Obama mandates, he's going to fine you."""	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
Weve lost 26 million jobs since (Obamas) been president.	In his first loss — by a mere 0.56 percent to conservative Felipe Calderon in 2006 — his supporters held months-long protests in Mexico City and he referred to himself as "the legitimate president." His allies are warning even before Sunday's presidential vote that there better not be any funny business. "They shouldn't dare commit a fraud, because if they do they will meet the devil," said Yeidckol Polevnsky, president of Lopez Obrador's Morena party. "We will not accept it." Still, the voting Sunday was by and large peaceful, apart from the usual complaints about some volunteer-staffed polling places opening late.
"Whether in Illinois or Washington, Barack Obama has bridged partisanship to bring about significant reform."	There is reason to believe that might happen. The foundation, in conjunction with UIC, recently held its Chicago Community Conversation on the West Side.

Like most foundation forums, it was a spectacular event, drawing everyone from MacArthur Foundation “genius grant” winner Rami Nashashibi to philanthropic organizations to Tony- and Grammy-winning performer Daveed Diggs. Notably absent, though, was Obama.
"I have cut taxes 63 times, including a 2006 property tax reduction that ranks as the largest in state history."	Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.

Under the Baucus bill ... federal funds would subsidize coverage of elective abortions.	There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void. In New Jersey, this is compounded by the fact that the state is located between two big cities, New York and Philadelphia, that are in other states. The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.

Cap-and-trade is wildly unpopular with Americans.	What has the government said? Mr Javid called on Russia to explain "exactly what has gone on", adding: "We will stand up to the actions that threaten our security." The home secretary said he was "comfortable" the "exact same nerve agent" had been used in both the Salisbury and Amesbury poisonings - but added it was not yet known if they were from the same batch. In response to Mr Javid's comments, Russia said the British government was subjecting them "to hell". Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova urged police not to be led by the "dirty political game" and said she was confident London would have to apologise to Russia.
By registration fewer than 20 percent of Florida voters are Independents.	Thapur wrote that the seven were given fewer rights by the government than a “member of al-Queda.”
Appointing Amul Thakar to the Supreme Court is an opportunity to make a bold outreach to the most prosperous of America’s immigrant communities and one that is increasingly important politically. The political benefits of naming Thapar are clear. Although Asian voters made up only 4 percent of the electorate in 2016, they are the fastest growing part of the electorate and a key factor in swing states such as Nevada (11 percent of the electorate) and Virginia (7 percent). Although they increasingly lean left, Republicans can get their votes. Nevada GOP Senator Dean Heller narrowly won re-election in 2012 by carrying 54 percent of the Asian vote.
Teachers were not involved in developing the Common Core State Standards.	The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. Teachers are also running a ballot measure campaign that would tax the highest income earners for an additional $690 million to spend on schools. “Regardless of political parties, we need people to make a decision about what’s happening in the classroom,” said Marisol Garcia, vice president of the Arizona Education Association. “To limit ourselves and to say ‘only these people are going to support us’ is just not true.”
Teachers can be at a disadvantage compared to wealthier candidates, who tend to have built-in networks of potential donors.

Began his career in environmental law at the EPA, as a special assistant in the agency's toxics office during President George H.W. Spent years playing various roles on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, which oversees the EPA, drafting regulations on chemical safety, air and water pollution and climate change — generally seeking to reduce government regulations on industries that generate greenhouse gases. Served as longtime aide to Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., whom you may recall from the 2015 floor speech in which he rebutted climate change science with a snowball. After leaving Congress, worked for years as a lobbyist for some of the largest coal, chemical and uranium companies in the U.S. — including the uranium mining firm that pushed for the reduction of Bears Ears National Monument, which is near one of its processing facilities.

But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.

And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday. “I can’t predict anything right now, but we’re taking a page from the civil rights movement. When nothing else was working, civil disobedience is what eventually made authorities and the government listen.”
Law enforcement officials have asked Pfleger to reconsider, saying the protesters are putting their lives on the line by walking onto a busy expressway. In fact, Illinois State police troopers, who have jurisdiction over Chicago expressways, will try to stop protesters from getting on the Dan Ryan — and arrests will be made, if necessary.

Said state insurance commissioner candidate Ralph Hudgens fights hard to strip women of life-saving coverage such as mammograms.	If that happens there would be plenty of credit to go around. Certainly President Moon would deserve great credit for his unprecedented initiative in engaging the North. Certainly Kim Jong Un would deserve great credit for seeing that he could achieve his country’s security without nuclear weapons. And certainly Trump would deserve great credit for seeing the possibility of a peaceful solution where many of his advisers saw military action as the only option. In the meantime, we have much hard work ahead.
"My two appointments to the Florida Supreme Court, Raul Cantero and Kenneth Bell, have earned reputations as its most consistent conservatives."	So it’s no exaggeration to say that critical legal rights and protections are truly hanging in the balance.”
‘A very, very modest preview’

“This was probably the best term that conservatives had in the supreme court maybe in my lifetime,” he said. The term might provide only “a very, very modest preview” of waves of conservative rulings to come, however, because a locked-down conservative majority would likely inspire rightwing activists to bring increasingly aggressive cases, said Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. “It’s not just that justice Kennedy’s successor is likely going to move the court to the right,” Vladeck said.
Says legislation supported by gay rights activists would strip mother and father from future Texas birth certificates.	Referendum to remove ‘outdated’ clause encouraging mothers to choose domestic duties over paid employment to be held by November
Ireland to vote over constitution clause on women's role in the home
Ireland will hold a referendum to remove a clause in the constitution marking the importance of a woman’s “life within the home” and encouraging mothers to shun paid employment to fulfil domestic duties, the government has announced. The move unveiled on Thursday is the latest to update Ireland’s socially conservative 1937 constitution to reflect a more secular and socially liberal population. Ireland was long one of Europe’s most socially conservative countries, but opinions have changed rapidly in recent decades as the power of the Roman Catholic church has waned. A 2015 referendum introduced gay marriage into the constitution and a vote earlier this year allowed access to abortion. The constitution, which includes a number of references to the country’s traditional Christian ethos, currently contains a clause that “recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the state a support without which the common good cannot be achieved”.
Says Gerald Daugherty advocated lowering the penalty for crimes like strangulation in domestic violence cases because they just throw more people into the jail system.	Practice is only one of Deborah Glass’s 125 recommendations not accepted by Victorian government
Female prisoners in Victoria are still subject to “abusive” routine strip searches, a state government watchdog says. The Victorian ombudsman, Deborah Glass, said the government has failed to adopt a recommendation from her 2015 report into the prison system that called for an end to the searches. “Why has the government not accepted my recommendation to stop the abusive practice of routinely strip-searching women prisoners – in fact, the only recommendation out of 125 not accepted?” she asked on Wednesday. The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year.

Says four-year terms for City Council members are the norm in most cities of our size.	Did he display these tendencies? He was a fairly good mayor. He used his term as mayor many times during the campaign [to show] how he was more pragmatic rather than authoritarian. And in that he is correct. He was also fairly popular as mayor and ended his term with a very respectable approval rating.
"Tommy Thompson is the father of welfare reform, creating the groundbreaking Wisconsin Works program in Wisconsin that became the model for national and international reforms."	López Obrador, or Amlo as he is best known, romped to a historic landslide victory on Sunday night, capitalising on public frustration at soaring crime rates and corruption with a promise to drain Mexico’s very own swamp. Indeed, some see similarities between the two men. Like Trump, Amlo cast himself as a political outsider during his campaign, despite having been a professional politician for decades, although Amlo avoided much of the New York billionaire’s nastiness and nativism. Both men are considered inward-looking nationalists with López Obrador claiming “the best foreign policy is domestic policy” and preaching “mexicanismo”, a philosophy some have compared to Trump’s America First. But the US president was not an election issue in the recent Mexican campaign.
We now sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before.	Those factories are the core of an American operation that employs about 136,000 people, but they're also dependent on components sourced overseas for reasons of cost or availability. About 70 percent of the parts in a U.S.-built Camry, the country's best-selling car, come from domestic suppliers. Toyota on June 27 said that Trump's threatened 25 percent tariff on automotive imports would add $1,800 to the price of each sedan. The carmaker's warning of the dangers of tit-for-tat tariffs was just one of many. German lighting manufacturer Osram Licht's shares plunged 22 percent Thursday after it announced a weaker outlook due to trade tensions.
Theres no wildlife in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.	There are fewer than 450 North Atlantic right whales left in the world, and Canada is under international pressure to step up protection of the species, after 12 of the animals were killed last year in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence – many of them in collisions with ships and some after becoming tangled in fishing gear. Scientists believe climate change is causing the species to shift its feeding grounds into the Gulf, putting it on a collision course with the shipping and fishing industries. US lawmakers, meanwhile, say Canada isn’t doing enough to protect the whales and are threatening to block Canadian fishermen from selling lobster into the American market.

In the survey, most say they are proud to be Americans, although Republicans feel that way more strongly (90 percent) than Democrats (61 percent). There is no consensus when asked about the country’s current course, though: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. “Overwhelming majorities of those in both parties and independents agree that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.”” USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll

On a cap-and-trade plan.	What has the government said? Mr Javid called on Russia to explain "exactly what has gone on", adding: "We will stand up to the actions that threaten our security." The home secretary said he was "comfortable" the "exact same nerve agent" had been used in both the Salisbury and Amesbury poisonings - but added it was not yet known if they were from the same batch. In response to Mr Javid's comments, Russia said the British government was subjecting them "to hell". Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova urged police not to be led by the "dirty political game" and said she was confident London would have to apologise to Russia.

"Says Obamas net neutrality proposalputs the government in charge of determining Internet pricing, terms of service and what types of products and services can be delivered."	Key California lawmakers said Thursday they've reached an agreement on legislation to enshrine net neutrality provisions in state law after the Federal Communications Commission dumped rules requiring an equal playing field on the internet. California's bill is one of the nation's most aggressive efforts to continue net neutrality, and the deal comes after a bitter fight among Democrats over how far the state should go. Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener, who repudiated his own legislation when major pieces were removed two weeks ago, said those provisions have been restored under his agreement with Democratic Assemblyman Miguel Santiago. "We need to ensure the internet is an open field where everyone has access, the companies that are providing internet access are not picking winners and losers," Wiener told reporters at a Capitol news conference. Santiago came under fire from net neutrality advocates around the country when the Assembly committee he leads stripped key provisions from the legislation — a decision that drew rebukes from members of Congress, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.
President Barack Obama reduced the cost of prescription drugs for nearly 3.6 million Americans in 2011.	But, though it would have been seen as a scoop, even the reporters covering Lyndon B. Johnson had the good sense not to report on every turd he dropped in their presence. While the founders envisioned a government that moved slowly and methodically, today’s Wi-Fi-enabled political discourse is demanding the opposite. Trump isn’t reinventing the wheel. If anything, he’s just spray painted an old, rusty wagon wheel with the glitzy gold that, over the decades, he’s made synonymous with his own family name. But this era of bright screens and on-demand delivery seems to be clouding our minds, as though we’ve purposefully trained ourselves to focus on the shiny spray painted object in front of us and not on the more important stories unfolding just off our phone screens.
Tampa Bay isleading the state in jobs creation.	A Florida man said Wednesday he felt “blessed” after someone turned in $1,300 he lost at a grocery store parking lot. Chris Woods, of Clearwater, had taken the money out from one bank account two weeks ago with the intention of putting it into another one, according to FOX13 Tampa Bay. He said he thinks he sandwiched the cash between two phones in his pocket and when he went to grab one of them in a Publix parking lot, the cash fell out. “We looked everywhere for it. I went everywhere and assumed it was gone,” Woods told the station.

But Matthew Buettgens, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a government and foundation supported policy research group says such budget discussion should take into account increased tax revenues and economic activity. "Of the states that have done detailed estimates of, 'What effect does Medicaid expansion have on the budget?' generally it's been found to be a net gain for the state," he says. Supporters say expansion could bring health insurance to around 90,000 low income Nebraskans – single people making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line, or $16,753 a year, or $34,638 for a four-person household. By law, the federal government would be required to pay 90 percent of the cost of that additional coverage.
Says Ted Cruz is a supporter of legalizing people that are in this country illegally and proposed giving them work permits.	In one case, Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion that illegal immigrants do not have the same bargaining rights as American citizens and legal workers. “… an illegal immigrant worker is not an ’employee’ under the NLRA for the simple reason that, ever since 1986, an illegal immigrant worker is not a lawful ’employee’ in the United States,” Kavanaugh wrote. In another case, Kavanaugh noted that American multi-national corporations do not have the right to import foreign workers. The Circuit judge explained, “Under the provision of the immigration laws at issue here, mere economic expediency does not authorize an employer to displace American workers for foreign workers.”
Prominent conservative Ann Coulter has also called for Trump to nominate Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, arguing that other judges such as Thomas Hardiman and Raymond Kethledge “are open borders zealots.”

Ross told CNBC earlier this week that he also shorted shares in Air Lease and Ocwen Financial. Ross, who plays a key role in increasingly high-stakes trade talks, says those sales were part of divestments made to work in government and he didn’t profit from those transactions. Democratic lawmakers are increasingly concerned, though. Last week, three members of Congress asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate whether Ross violated insider-trading laws.

"There really is nothing remarkable about a Christian bishop who holds to this teaching." While Bishops can place limitations on the use of the marriage liturgies, they must refer couples to a willing diocese if they do not authorize them.

Even Pruitt’s own staff had begun to sour on him, with many worrying that their future career prospects would be damaged by their association with Pruitt’s tenure. Each scandal seemed more damning than the last. Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.

Half of Oregon university students are on Pell Grants.	Breitbart News reported in April 2017 that the major Missouri institution would close a total of seven residential buildings. “Historically every year between now and August, various situations occur that result in position openings, e.g. normal attrition and voluntary staff choices, as well as unplanned academic or personal challenges,” the university said in a statement. “If necessary, we will offer alternative employment opportunities at comparable compensation to the remaining staff.”
Several years later, the university is still facing a crisis. According to new reports, the University of Missouri is currently facing a $49 million budget shortfall. Additionally, the university has laid off 30 employees and eliminated 155 vacant positions.
"Says uncompensated health care costs absorbed by Texas hospitals are adding $1,800 a year to Texas private insurance rates."	A helicopter trip to a hospital may not be the only shock a patient faces after a bad accident. The next one could hit when the bill arrives. Rides in so-called air ambulances can lead to bills of more than $20,000 depending on a person's coverage, and insurance experts say big invoices are becoming more common as costs rise and coverage shifts. Air ambulances transport around 400,000 people each year in the U.S., according to industry estimates. Most trips are from one hospital to another.
Invested $90 million in traffic fixes without raising taxes.	There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void. In New Jersey, this is compounded by the fact that the state is located between two big cities, New York and Philadelphia, that are in other states. The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.
"Countries bombed: Obama 7, Bush 4"	(AFP) BEIRUT, Lebanon — At least eight battered rebel-held towns in southern Syria returned to regime control under Russian-brokered deals on Saturday as air strikes killed at least 15 civilians, a monitor said. Since June 19, backed by its ally Russia, the Damascus regime has carried out a deadly bombing campaign in southern Syria as it pushes to retake the strategic area bordering Jordan and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. As of Saturday, government forces controlled more than half of Daraa, up from just 30 percent at the start of the operation, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said. Eight towns in the province returned to regime control under Russia-brokered deals, the Observatory said. That came “after talks in each town between Russian generals as well as local notables and remaining rebels,” Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman said.

"A report in Navy Times said that 7.3 percent of Army, Navy and Marines have thought about attempting suicide."	Some immigrant U.S. Army reservists and recruits who enlisted in the military with a promised path to citizenship are being abruptly discharged, the Associated Press has learned. The AP was unable to quantify how many men and women who enlisted through the special recruitment program have been booted from the Army, but immigration attorneys say they know of more than 40 who have been discharged or whose status has become questionable, jeopardizing their futures. "It was my dream to serve in the military," said reservist Lucas Calixto, a Brazilian immigrant who filed a lawsuit against the Army last week. "Since this country has been so good to me, I thought it was the least I could do to give back to my adopted country and serve in the United States military." Some of the service members say they were not told why they were being discharged.
We cut property taxes by one-third in the state of Texas while Ive been governor.	Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
Says Texas passed a state Dream Act before any other state.	Under the laws, up to 40% of Supreme Court judges could be forced out. The first president of the court, Malgorzata Gersdorf, could be among those pushed out before her six-year term ends, by a rule that brings down the retirement age from 70 to 65, the EU warns.

"Hillsboroughs Public Transportation Commission has a rule that says cabbies have to wear socks. I mean, please. Come on."	That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different. The interstate highways and the air travel revolution killed off most of the country’s long-distance passenger rail. The original Penn Station was razed in all its neoclassical glory, and its cramped replacement is a dingy national embarrassment. But 108 years later, the nation’s dense metropolitan areas still depend on railroads to bring millions of suburban commuters to their jobs; Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor line has become profitable and popular; and those twin Hudson tunnels and the swing-span Portal Bridge carry 450 New Jersey Transit and Amtrak trains every day.
"Increasing the min. wage to $15 an hour would reduce spending on food stamps, public housing and other programs by over $7.6 billion a year."	America has a love-hate relationship with Walmart (WMT), sparking debates about whether the giant retailer helps or hurts the country's economy. It turns out that Walmart might be helping one segment that's overlooked in the debate: low-income families who struggle with food insecurity, according to new research from economists at Georgia State University, Nairobi's Columbia Global Centers and Samford University, and funded by the University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Some municipalities have sought to block or restrict Walmart from opening up within their borders, often on the grounds that a new Walmart could hurt local businesses. The researchers said they wanted to come at the question of Walmart's impact from another direction: "Are barriers to Walmart's entry at odds with the goal of eliminating hunger?"

As well as a new president, Mexican will be voting for 128 senators and 500 deputies in Congress as well as state and local officials. In all, 88 million people will be eligible to vote. Mexico is the second largest economy in Latin America and a major oil exporter. However, oil prices have dropped and the Mexican currency, the peso, has fallen sharply against the dollar. More than 40% of the population lives in poverty and high levels of corruption and violence have led some companies to pull out of the worst affected areas.

Texas ranks 49th in per-pupil funding among the states.	'We’re going to run different'
His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
The Washington Times ... pointed out that we had succeeded where previous administrations had failed on spending cuts.	3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.

Something had been wrong for months. That spring, Flint, under direction from state officials, turned off the drinking water it had relied upon for nearly 50 years. The city planned to join a new regional system, and while it waited for it to be built, it began bringing in its water from the Flint River.
"Here in Virginia, we have the opportunity to become the first state on the East Coast to explore for and produce oil and natural gas offshore."	“They have to put out another 2 million barrels in my opinion,” he said in the July 1 Fox interview. “Gas prices are up & they are doing little to help,” he complained again on Twitter on July 4. “This must be a two-way street. REDUCE PRICING NOW!”
DRIVERS AND VOTERS
The United States has always been both a major producer and consumer of oil, which means that most presidents have favored moderate oil prices. High prices hurt motorists and oil consumers across the country.
Donald Trumps decision to skip the Fox News/Google debate in Des Moines is near unprecedented.	Cotlar had worked as the voice of Drake University's teams since 2005. Witnesses told police that Cotlar was swept away as he got out of his stalled van. His body was found nearly four hours later, several blocks away. Flooding is expected to continue along Walnut Creek, Fourmile Creek and Raccoon River. However, the rain threat is believed to be over and waters are beginning to recede.
The McCain campaign is roughly in the position where Vice President Gore was running against President Bush one week before the election of 2000.	And then you have the old guard, like Pelosi and others at the top. And there is no overall messaging that is bringing that all together. That's why these arguments like abolish ICE start catching fire, because there's no other counter message out there from the Democrats--
CORNELL BELCHER:
I hate being the one who has to take up for Democrats. However, I will say this is all very reminiscent of a lot of conversations we heard in 2008 about the old versus the new guard. I think, look, where are Democrats on the major policies?
We've won twice as many states. We've won a greater share of the popular vote.	You’ve got just days left to nominate the very best teams and individuals working across the public realm. Those from the NHS can enter too!”
Previous winners have told the Guardian how much difference it has made to their working lives. “I think it gave an extra boost to our performance because people worked even harder to show the impact they could have by engaging families differently,” said Sue Williams, director of family safeguarding at Hertfordshire county council, which won the care award last year and was named the overall winner of the night. “Almost every public authority wanted to come and visit us to see what we’ve done and to share our work with them.”
Williams said winning the award made every staff member, from the team administrator to senior managers, “absolutely ecstatic”. Nominate your 2018 public servant of the year Read more

"Health care reform: Everything about it is going to raise costs, raise taxes and lower the quality of health care."	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.

"Since 1965, the United States has spent untold trillions yet the poverty rate hasnt budged."	The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) spent a total of $4 billion on improper food stamp payments to those receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the USDA confirmed with Breitbart News on Friday. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service announced this week that improper payments made up 6.3 percent of SNAP money in the fiscal year (FY) 2017—the latest data available from the agency. Breitbart News analyzed the USDA’s data on food stamp spending and found that $4,007,026,532 of the $63,603,595,754 the agency spent on SNAP in FY 2017 went to improper payments. The USDA told Breitbart News that “it is important to note that improper payments include both overpayments and underpayments,” meaning that households on SNAP that received less than what they were supposed to receive for the month are also included in the percentage rate. Brandon Lipps, the Acting Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services at the agency, said that most improper payments are due to “human errors”—either because of state agencies miscalculating benefits or benefit recipients giving state agencies the wrong information.
It costs a hell of a lot more money to put somebody in jail than send them to the University of Virginia.	Practice is only one of Deborah Glass’s 125 recommendations not accepted by Victorian government
Female prisoners in Victoria are still subject to “abusive” routine strip searches, a state government watchdog says. The Victorian ombudsman, Deborah Glass, said the government has failed to adopt a recommendation from her 2015 report into the prison system that called for an end to the searches. “Why has the government not accepted my recommendation to stop the abusive practice of routinely strip-searching women prisoners – in fact, the only recommendation out of 125 not accepted?” she asked on Wednesday. The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year.
New Jersey is the only state in the union that spent less on higher education than it did at the beginning of the decade.	There is ample evidence to back this up. Staffing and resources at print newspapers have been shrinking for years and digital start-ups have only partially filled the void. In New Jersey, this is compounded by the fact that the state is located between two big cities, New York and Philadelphia, that are in other states. The practical effect: Less coverage of hyperlocal issues. So advocates and state lawmakers argued that public funds should support "civic information" -- news coverage, yes, but also things like databases and media literacy initiatives.
Says he and Mitt Romney always said that we agree with the 2014 deadline for leaving Afghanistan.	The problem is so pervasive that a lawmaker recently asked El Salvador's Legislative Assembly for national identity cards to be issued without addresses "to save lives." Fifteen years ago, the Salvadoran government began a crackdown on gangs, resulting in thousands of members being imprisoned. Yet they continued to proliferate, even running operations with cell phones from behind bars. El Salvador's defense minister said in 2015 there were 60,000 gang members in the country, compared to a combined police and army strength of 50,000. Members of those security forces contribute to the violence that is causing the northward migration.
Says he said last year theres absolutely no reason for Texas to secede.	Jordan, who has served in the House since 2007, repeatedly has said he only learned about the alleged abuse this spring, when former students began speaking out. On Tuesday there were conflicting claims Jordan that had been contacted by the university's law firm regarding the investigation. But Jordan's office maintains it has no records of any efforts to contact the congressman: "Despite claims to the contrary, Congressman Jordan's office has not received a request for interview from the investigative team. We have demanded that they send us the supposed communication and remain willing to assist in any way that we can." Former Ohio State wrestler Mike DiSabato, whose allegations against Strauss prompted the investigation, told NBC that Jordan was lying.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. Federal prosecutors on Tuesday publicly debunked conspiracy theories pushed by President Donald Trump and right-wing media that a former Democratic aide charged with bank fraud was actually a foreign spy trying to steal government secrets. In a plea deal with Imran Awan, who worked as an information technology aide for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., and other Democratic lawmakers, prosecutors said they had conducted "a thorough investigation" into claims that Awan stole information from government servers on behalf of another country while working for House Democrats, but reported that they found no evidence to support the conspiracy theories. "The Government agrees that the public allegations that (Awan) stole U.S. House of Representatives equipment and engaged in unauthorized or illegal conduct involving House computer systems do not form the basis of any conduct relevant to the determination of the sentence in this case," prosecutors said.
"Boccieri voted to spend a billion dollars an hour, every hour, for his first 50 days in office"	Last week, the new Italian government – a coalition of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the far-right Lega – was so frustrated by the failure to make progress on migration that it refused to sign the conclusions of the European council. “Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,” an Italian official said. Italy – which is now at the centre of both the euro and refugee crises as much as Greece once was – could be the key swing state in the three-way clash of visions. There are sections of Italian society that support each. Much of the Italian centre-right – which always supported European integration and in particular the euro as a way to impose external discipline on the country – supports Merkel’s vision of a competitive Europe.
"While Mandels been busy traveling the country raising campaign money, he hasnt shown up for work."	If anything, he’s just spray painted an old, rusty wagon wheel with the glitzy gold that, over the decades, he’s made synonymous with his own family name. But this era of bright screens and on-demand delivery seems to be clouding our minds, as though we’ve purposefully trained ourselves to focus on the shiny spray painted object in front of us and not on the more important stories unfolding just off our phone screens. While the founders envisioned a government that moved slowly and methodically, today’s Wi-Fi-enabled political discourse is demanding the opposite, and the allure of being one day’s internet sensation has drawn most all of us in like moths to a flame named Trump — the one steady, bright light that we all shamelessly, even helplessly, flitter towards even as we should know the momentary warmth is hiding the heat that will eventually be our own doom. Trump’s chaos theory of running companies is now on full display in the West Wing, but it’s also on display in the rest of us. He’s the made himself the center of our universe, and most of us are now unwittingly circling his orbit.

Algeria has abandoned more than 13,000 migrants in the Niger desert in the past 14 months, according to new reports. NPR's Michel Martin talks with AP reporter Lori Hinnant about their plight. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
The EU has been putting pressure on countries to stop migrants from entering Europe through North Africa, but that's precipitating another humanitarian crisis. The Associated Press is reporting that Algeria has abandoned more than 13,000 migrants and refugees in the Sahara Desert over the last 14 months. The migrants are mostly people who are crossing Algeria trying to get to Europe.
A million people a year come into the U.S. legally. No other country even comes close to that figure.	Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.
The majority of people in polls do not support Obamacare.	The vast majority of swing voters across the United States oppose the Democrats’ latest plan to abolish all immigration enforcement by ending the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. In recent weeks, Democrats in the House and Senate, along with progressive liberals like Cynthia Nixon in New York and most recently insurgent Democrat candidate for Congress, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have been demanding ICE be abolished and all immigration enforcement be ended. House Democrats are now crafting legislation that would officially abolish ICE. The latest Harvard/Harris Poll, though, reveals that swing voters are overwhelmingly opposed to the Democrats’ plan to end all immigration enforcement across the U.S.
Nearly 3-in-4 swing voters, about 73 percent, of swing voters said they do not want ICE to be disbanded. Less than 30 percent of swing voters said they support the abolishment of ICE.
"The Obama administration was actively supporting Al Qaeda in Iraq, the terrorist group that became the Islamic State."	President Trump has just said in the past week he's going to raise things like Syria, like Ukraine, like the election meddling issue, really the whole range of issues between us. And I think that, in the president's mind, this is very important, because it gives him an opportunity to size up Vladimir Putin, to see where there are areas where we might make progress together and where there are areas where we may not. BRENNAN: Well, right now, Russia is blanket-bombing Southern Syria. That violates the last agreement Vladimir Putin made with President Trump. Why would he believe that he's in any way trustworthy?

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

"Says administrator salaries were increased, but other school employees were left behind."	Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt’s resignation was “long overdue,” some lawmakers said as President Trump announced the Cabinet change on Thursday. Pruitt, 50, and his office, which he led since 2017, had come under fire for extravagant spending habits, including on first-class travel, pay raises to top aides and a $43,000 soundproof booth. In announcing his resignation on July 5, Trump said Pruitt had “done an outstanding job” leading the EPA and “will always be thankful to him for this.”
The resignation sparked a variety of responses from lawmakers. “Scott Pruitt was the worst EPA administrator in the history of the agency. Not only has he acted, time and time again, in an unethical manner, but he has led the agency in exactly the wrong direction,” Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said in a statement.

In their statement, Mr Netanyahu and Mr Morawiecki praised the Polish wartime government-in-exile, saying it tried to "raise awareness among Western allies of the systematic murder" of Polish Jews. They also said structures of the Polish underground state supervised by the Polish government-in-exile "created a mechanism of systematic help and support to Jewish people". However Yad Vashem said this contradicted decades of historical research and contained "grave errors and deceptions". It said much of the Polish resistance in its various movements "not only failed to help Jews, but was also not infrequently actively involved in persecuting them". Polish assistance to Jews during the Holocaust was "relatively rare", Yad Vashem said, and "attacks against and even the murder of Jews were widespread".

Trump’s campaign to limit legal and illegal immigration is driving up wages and salaries for Americans in various locations and careers around the country. The beneficiaries include new employees, African-American bakers in Chicago, Latino restaurant workers in Monterey, Calif., disabled people nationwide, high schoolers, resort workers in Hilton Head, construction workers, Superbowl workers, the garment industry, and workers at small businesses, and even Warren Buffett’s railroad workers. Amnesty advocates rely on business-funded “Nation of Immigrants” push-polls to show apparent voter support for immigration and immigrants. But “choice” polls reveal most voters’ often-ignored preference that CEOs should hire Americans at decent wages before hiring migrants.

Split those revenues, with 35 percent going to K-12 education, 35 percent to roads, 15 percent to the communities that allow marijuana businesses in their communities and 15 percent to counties where marijuana business are located. Allow communities to decide whether they’ll allow marijuana businesses in their towns.
"Says that when Congressman (Steve) Cohen took office in 2007, the unemployment rate was at 4.8 percent. The unemployment rate in Shelby County has reached 9.7 percent."	Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) trashed the June jobs report — even though it showed rapid job growth, rising wages, and low unemployment. The report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that employers created 213,000 new jobs in June — 22,000 more than economists had expected. Manufacturing jobs in particular rose by 36,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.

But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.

"President Obama pledged to go through the budget 'line by line,' but on his watch, non-defense spending has spiraled out of control, increasing by 67 percent in the last year alone."	In the lead-up to the upcoming NATO summit in Brussels, President Donald Trump has reportedly sent “sharply worded letters” to the leaders of several NATO allies, escalating his long-simmering feud with the military alliance. The New York Times reported Monday that the letters, sent last month to leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Prime Minister Charles Michel of Belgium, rebuked NATO allies for not spending enough on their own defense ― a criticism that Trump has repeatedly leveled against other alliance members. The president also suggested in the letters that the U.S. would consider reducing its military commitment globally if its allies don’t ramp up spending, reported the Times. In his letter to Merkel, Trump reportedly wrote: “There is growing frustration in the United States that some allies have not stepped up as promised. The United States continues to devote more resources to the defense of Europe when the Continent’s economy, including Germany’s, are doing well and security challenges abound.
Says Chuck Hagels nomination as defense secretary has been publicly celebrated by the Iranian government.	President Donald Trump appeared to rely on a dubious Fox News report Tuesday morning to unleash an attack on his predecessor, accusing President Barack Obama, without any real evidence, of granting citizenship to 2,500 Iranians as part of nuclear deal negotiations. "Just out that Obama Administration granted citizenship, during the terrible Iran Deal negotiation, to 2,500 Iranians - including to government officials," Trump tweeted. "How big (and bad) is that?" Jeff Prescott, the former senior director on Obama's National Security Council, called Trump's allegation "absurd and entirely false." Prescott shared with CNN immigration data from the Department of Homeland Security which showed that the number of Iranians naturalized in the United States over the course of the Obama and Bush administrations was relatively consistent.

Scott Pruitt, who has finally stepped down as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency after a long-rumbling corruption scandal, rose to public prominence on the back of a series of increasingly outlandish ethical controversies. Scott Pruitt resigns: Trump's scandal-ridden EPA chief steps down Read more
From lobbying fast food company Chick-fil-A on behalf of his wife, to demanding his staff acquire a mattress from a Trump Hotel – not to mention the millions of taxpayer dollars spent on security, first-class travel and soundproof booths – Pruitt’s behavior clashed spectacularly with any pretense of Trump’s pledge to “drain the swamp” in Washington. But the lasting legacy of the former Oklahoma attorney general – who was picked by Trump after crusading against what he called the EPA’s “activist agenda” – is likely to be felt in the systematic weakening of environmental regulations. While not as eye-catching as, for example, his demand that his official vehicle use sirens so he could reach a French restaurant on time, Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left behind a demoralized agency where staff fret that their ability to protect public health has been diminished. A staunch ally of oil and gas companies, Pruitt stacked EPA advisory boards with industry representatives and sought to set aside whole troves of research that link pollution to various illnesses.

Congress has passed various immigration laws; some have been interpreted to allow the executive to restrict immigration the way Trump has, while other interpretations suggest that he cannot. The courts will rule on the question, and the Trump administration will almost certainly honor that ruling, as it has every other court ruling. That does not mean Trump will be nice about it; it does not mean the absence of absurd, scurrilous and misleading tweets. It simply means that the legal process will be obeyed.

Each scandal seemed more damning than the last. Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.

So in a striking show of unity, the two universities came together for a community breakfast designed to send a message to Obama.

Began his career in environmental law at the EPA, as a special assistant in the agency's toxics office during President George H.W. Spent years playing various roles on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, which oversees the EPA, drafting regulations on chemical safety, air and water pollution and climate change — generally seeking to reduce government regulations on industries that generate greenhouse gases. Served as longtime aide to Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., whom you may recall from the 2015 floor speech in which he rebutted climate change science with a snowball. After leaving Congress, worked for years as a lobbyist for some of the largest coal, chemical and uranium companies in the U.S. — including the uranium mining firm that pushed for the reduction of Bears Ears National Monument, which is near one of its processing facilities.
"In Providence, R.I., its illegal to sell toothpaste and a toothbrush to the same customer on a Sunday."	Trump has since signed an executive order to block the separation of undocumented families attempting to enter the country, but Birdwell believes that’s not enough to undo damage the policy has caused. “There’s no guarantee that they'll go back with their parents again, and beside all the torture they've gone though, they are going to need a lot of help and support and psychological help and emotional help through all this,” Birdwell said. Those who attended the Round Lake Beach rally were encouraged to bring 24-inch-by-24-inch piece of fabric to share their message of outrage and to start a quilt that Birdwell intends to send to elected officials in Washington, D.C.
Birdwell also arranged for a station where those in attendance could register to vote.

However, oil prices have dropped and the Mexican currency, the peso, has fallen sharply against the dollar. More than 40% of the population lives in poverty and high levels of corruption and violence have led some companies to pull out of the worst affected areas. The run-up to Sunday's elections has seen some of the worst violence in living memory, our correspondent says, as criminal groups attempt to control local politics. More than 130 candidates and political workers have been killed across the country since campaigning began in September. On Saturday, a journalist was shot dead in a bar in the village of Saban in the southern state of Quintana Roo, officials said.
"Georgia has lost more than 124,000 jobs and the unemployment rate has increased since the stimulus passed"	Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) trashed the June jobs report — even though it showed rapid job growth, rising wages, and low unemployment. The report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that employers created 213,000 new jobs in June — 22,000 more than economists had expected. Manufacturing jobs in particular rose by 36,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.

"The average fast food worker is 29, and most fast food workers are on some form of public assistance."	The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) spent a total of $4 billion on improper food stamp payments to those receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the USDA confirmed with Breitbart News on Friday. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service announced this week that improper payments made up 6.3 percent of SNAP money in the fiscal year (FY) 2017—the latest data available from the agency. Breitbart News analyzed the USDA’s data on food stamp spending and found that $4,007,026,532 of the $63,603,595,754 the agency spent on SNAP in FY 2017 went to improper payments. The USDA told Breitbart News that “it is important to note that improper payments include both overpayments and underpayments,” meaning that households on SNAP that received less than what they were supposed to receive for the month are also included in the percentage rate. Brandon Lipps, the Acting Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services at the agency, said that most improper payments are due to “human errors”—either because of state agencies miscalculating benefits or benefit recipients giving state agencies the wrong information.

The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.
"Huckabee ""was one of the highest taxing governors that we had in this country and rivaling Bill Clinton in terms of the Cato ratings."""	Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.

On Wednesday, Mr McVey said the council had "engaged pretty consistently" with the government, adding: "Fiona Hyslop said any scheme would require engagement with the industry and that's exactly what we're doing. "We have taken a far more robust and professional approach and I've noticed a huge amount of openness to the idea in some quarters that were fairly dismissive of our previous attempts as a local authority." The Scottish Conservatives - who oppose having a tourist tax scheme - said the exchange was "an embarrassing split right at the top of the SNP", with Ms Hyslop "slapping down" Mr McVey "in full public view".
"In an average grocery store, roughly 75 percent of processed foods contain genetically modified organisms, or GMOs."	They are to consult on detailed plans to restrict the promotion and marketing of foods high in salt, sugar and fat.

Newly appointed public health minister Joe Fitzpatrick said "far too many people" were facing "serious risks to their health" which were "largely avoidable". 'Profound impact'
The new government report states that "the Scottish diet remains stubbornly unhealthy", with the country "far from meeting our dietary goals" - something which has a "profound" impact on health and lifestyle.

Hovering over the election is the specter of vote fraud, though electoral officials deny it is a possibility with the modern balloting technology and institutions now in place. In both of Lopez Obrador's previous two presidential losses he alleged fraud. In his first loss — by a mere 0.56 percent to conservative Felipe Calderon in 2006 — his supporters held months-long protests in Mexico City and he referred to himself as "the legitimate president." His allies are warning even before Sunday's presidential vote that there better not be any funny business.

Justice John Roberts Signed Off On Obamas Arrest For Treason.	In what ways should these concerns shape congressional expectations about transparency of the nominee vetting process and the standards for recusal in cases involving President Trump’s legal affairs? Consider first the not-unlikely prospect of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who has developed a robust view of presidential immunity from legal process fully consistent with some of the more aggressive positions of the president and his legal team. Kavanaugh has written that:
Congress might consider a law exempting a President—while in office—from criminal prosecution and investigation, including from questioning by criminal prosecutors or defense counsel. Criminal investigations targeted at or revolving around a President are inevitably politicized by both their supporters and critics. As I have written before, “no Attorney General or special counsel will have the necessary credibility to avoid the inevitable charges that he is politically motivated—whether in favor of the President or against him, depending on the individual leading the investigation and its results.” The indictment and trial of a sitting President, moreover, would cripple the federal government, rendering it unable to function with credibility in either the international or domestic arenas.
All Aboard Florida is receiving millions in Florida taxpayer dollars.	Teddy Roosevelt hopped on whistle stop tour after whistle stop tour where he was able to drop into rural and suburban communities alike to deliver short, pre-packaged speeches that local papers would usually print verbatim. (He left them short on purpose for that very reason.) Franklin Roosevelt revolutionized and heightened the stature of the office with his fireside chats, that brought his message over the heads of the pesky press corps and directly into the living rooms of the American people. But, though it would have been seen as a scoop, even the reporters covering Lyndon B. Johnson had the good sense not to report on every turd he dropped in their presence. While the founders envisioned a government that moved slowly and methodically, today’s Wi-Fi-enabled political discourse is demanding the opposite.
Ninety million Americans either arent working or arent looking for work.	As well as a new president, Mexican will be voting for 128 senators and 500 deputies in Congress as well as state and local officials. In all, 88 million people will be eligible to vote. Mexico is the second largest economy in Latin America and a major oil exporter. However, oil prices have dropped and the Mexican currency, the peso, has fallen sharply against the dollar. More than 40% of the population lives in poverty and high levels of corruption and violence have led some companies to pull out of the worst affected areas.
The Iranians are now saying that what were saying the deal is and what they understand it to be are two different things.	Any amount of prescription opioid use was correlated with greater involvement. Among people with prescription opioid use disorder, nearly 20 percent had criminal justice involvement. For heroin users, it was 40 percent. "People who use opioids, including heroin, were up to 13 times more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system," says Winkelman. The study shows the complexity of the the opioid crisis, according to Josiah Rich, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Brown University, who wasn't involved in the research.
The federal government has 77 different means-tested social welfare programs.	It was no surprise to read that the very first lesson you suggest could be learned from overseas (Five things the NHS could do to improve service, 3 July) is the establishment of integrated health and social care, as has happened in New Zealand. The achievements of the Attlee government are at the heart of my socialist beliefs but the compromises which led then to the split between free NHS care and means-tested social care remain the achilles heel as the NHS celebrates 70 years. It is utterly ludicrous to have separate systems which imply distinct and neat boundaries between health and care, with rather a lot of people making a good living arguing on which side of the fence some poor demented soul belongs. Disputes around the funding of continuing care have become a major industry. The recent NHS funding announcement, making no reference whatsoever to social care, evidenced the fact that the government still hasn’t the least idea of how the two are umbilically linked.
To use money from the TARP fund in the manner that is being discussed by the White House and congressional Democrats would be a violation of the law.	This was particularly an issue for Pruitt’s former executive scheduler Sydney Hupp, who often had to shell out for Pruitt’s trips. Hupp was also asked by Pruitt to speak with staff at one of Trump’s hotels, believing he could get a deal on a second-hand mattress they were selling. Pruitt remained miserly even when he was abusing his position to get a good deal. He fell behind on the rental payments on the condo he was getting on the cheap and eventually had to be evicted and the locks were changed.
"Because George Holding doesnt live in the congressional district hes running for, he doesnt experience the same things that we are all experiencing."	'We’re going to run different'
His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
Weve cut the deficit by two-thirds.	3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.

For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.

A bipartisan, congressionally mandated report on federal prisons issued in 2016 said the system was in a state of crisis and called for massive changes to the nation’s sentencing policies in order to relieve the strain. Unsurprisingly in an election year, wide changes weren’t implemented.

The CEO of Goldman Sachs let his employees know that hed be just fine with either Bush or Clinton.	He took a short position in shipping company Navigator Holdings worth between $100,001 and $250,000 on Oct. 31, five days after the New York Times contacted him about an article linking Navigator indirectly to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Ross, who plays a key role in increasingly high-stakes trade talks, says those sales were part of divestments made to work in government and he didn’t profit from those transactions.

Republican leadership took the lead confirming Loretta Lynch as attorney general.	The strategy reprises last year's successful approach to confirming Justice Neil Gorsuch in the early spring of 2017. Gorsuch was named to fill the vacancy left by the death of Antonin Scalia and then kept open by the refusal of the Senate's Republican majority to consider Merrick Garland, the replacement named by President Barack Obama in 2016. Gorsuch was greeted with delight by abortion opponents, even though he had not ruled directly on Roe in his judicial career. But his confirmation was far from a sure thing because two Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, were seen as defenders of abortion rights.

"Its bad enough that (Stephen) Silberkraus appeared in a sexual fetish film where women were kidnapped from their homes and forced to live naked in kennels and trained to be pets. But when Silberkraus isnt acting in films that degrade women, hes stalking them in his personal time."	Veteran actor James Woods was dropped by his “liberal” talent agent on July 4, according to a tweet by the Oscar-nominated actor. “It’s the 4th of July and I’m feeling patriotic,” agent Ken Kaplan wrote, according to a screenshot of the email posted by Woods. “I don’t want to represent you anymore. I could go on a rant but you know what I would say.”
Woods, who is a rare and outspoken President Donald Trump supporter in Hollywood, identified his former agent as a “political liberal.”
So this email from my agent (a political liberal) today… pic.twitter.com/RLXUWi9no8 — James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) July 5, 2018
In a separate tweet, Woods said he responded to Kaplan saying, “Dear Ken, I don’t actually. I was thinking if you’re feeling patriotic, you would appreciate free speech and one’s right to think as an individual.
"Says Hillary Clinton voted to raise taxes on workers earning as little as $41,500."	B
Trump’s campaign to limit legal and illegal immigration is driving up wages and salaries for Americans in various locations and careers around the country. The beneficiaries include new employees, African-American bakers in Chicago, Latino restaurant workers in Monterey, Calif., disabled people nationwide, high schoolers, resort workers in Hilton Head, construction workers, Superbowl workers, the garment industry, and workers at small businesses, and even Warren Buffett’s railroad workers. Amnesty advocates rely on business-funded “Nation of Immigrants” push-polls to show apparent voter support for immigration and immigrants. But “choice” polls reveal most voters’ often-ignored preference that CEOs should hire Americans at decent wages before hiring migrants.
"You know, the approval rating of Congress is down to 13 percent."	A new USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll about patriotism, pegged to this week's celebration of the Fourth of July, finds an overwhelming majority of those surveyed — 90 percent — say they are proud to be Americans. But they split almost down the middle, 42 percent to 39 percent, when asked whether they are proud of America right now. Not surprisingly, the split was along partisan lines: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. There was bipartisan agreement on one thing: Across party lines, roughly seven in 10 agree with the statement, "I feel fatigued watching the news." Elsewhere in politics

Says Rick Santorum funded Planned Parenthood.	BREAKING: @NEAToday President @Lily_NEA reacts to radical ruling by #SCOTUS: "We are living in a system that is rigged to benefit special interests & billionaires, all at the expense of working people." FULL STATEMENT: https://t.co/uE4j5lQPGh #Janus #JanusvAFSCME #Union — NEA Public Relations (@NEAMedia) June 27, 2018
A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.
Schools in some states are spending up to 100 days a year doing test-prep or actual testing.	In an abstract way I am interested in finding out how Gilead was formed and where resistance to it might lie, but I cannot stomach any more torture scenes. If I want to watch terrified women, I can watch the news. We are told we have come a long way and that we are free. We look at other parts of the world, where women are not allowed to vote, or dance, and we see ourselves as modern and liberated. But all our “freedoms” are fairly recent, from being able to get a mortgage to being protected from rape in marriage.
"In Oregon, students are skipping math class to learn about the Bible."	Brennan moved twice while growing up, from one apartment to another before settling in a three-family house in North Bergen. His grandmother lived on the top floor. “My dad worked construction in those years,” Tom remembers. “Those jobs were not easy to come by.” When the construction business slowed down, Owen would find odd jobs. For a time, he commuted into Manhattan to fold papers for The Daily News.
The United States right now incarcerates more African-Americans as a percentage than apartheid South Africa did.	PORTLAND, Ore. -- Two opposing protest groups -- Patriot Prayer and antifa -- clashed in downtown Portland Saturday, CBS Portland affiliate KOIN reports. Portland police said failure to leave the area could leave to arrests, calling the demonstration a riot. More than 100 members of Patriot Prayer group gathered at Terry Schrunk Plaza for a "freedom rally," while more than 100 counter protesters with an antifa group gathered across the street at Chapman Square for rallies before a march. Police revoked Patriot Prayer's permit for the rally after the two groups began to clash. People were lighting firecrackers and smoke bombs in the crowd while police used flash bangs in an effort to disperse the clashing protesters.
"Before 2005, the percentage of Texas high school students meeting the college readiness standards of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board stood at 28% in English and 42% in math. Those figures stood at 65% and 66% in 2013."	Michigan lawmakers axed a requirement that would make prospective teachers take a basic skills test before earning their certification in Michigan. Rick Snyder signed legislation last week to get rid of the law requiring all prospective teachers to take the SAT to become certified in the state of Michigan, the Detroit Free Press reported. “The basic skills test … is not a strong indicator of how successful a teacher will be,” said Sen. Marty Knollenberg (R-Troy), one of the sponsors of the bipartisan-supported legislation. Knollenberg, who serves as the state Senate Education Committee chair, said the panel made its decision to make it easier for people to become teachers.
Obama's liberal fiscal agenda: Over $874-billion in new spending.	3) Tax reform
The president touted the tax overhaul he signed back in December, his only legislative victory to date. He said there would be a "part 2" rolled out in the coming months. “We're doing a phase two,” Trump said. “We'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that, and it’ll be more of a middle class — we did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we’re thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20 and for the most part, the rest of it will go right to the middle class.
Tommy Thompson made millions from corporations who outsource American jobs and now hes trying to lavish huge tax breaks on them.	ZTE is far from alone. China assembles some 90 percent of the world's smartphones, computers and other electronics. But most of the revenue flows to American companies that supply computer chips and other technology. In the broader economy, Chinese banks, airlines, farms and other industries need U.S. technology from jetliners to drugs to software. What Washington welcomes as a source of well-paid jobs, Chinese leaders consider a dangerous dependence.
Georgia has a well-deserved reputation for setting the gold standard for food safety.	During Tuesday's hearing, the judge had the men say no contest as the name of each victim was read. It was an emotional process that took 30 minutes and saw family members and friends cry quietly when their loved ones were named. Gregory said he and other families would have preferred a trial and sentences as long as life in prison. He cut off reporters' questions when they asked how he felt when he heard his daughter's name read in court. Prosecutor Autrey James said the two men were convicted "because they acted negligently running that building known as the Ghost Ship."

We have created more jobs in this last year than the Bush administration (did) in eight years.	The services sector, where most Americans are employed, has now expanded for 101 consecutive months, or more than eight years. The gain was better than many economists had been expecting and depicts an overall economy that appears to be regaining momentum after a slowdown in the winter.

David Shulkin, Veterans Affairs Secretary - 28 March 2018
A doctor, he had served as undersecretary of veterans affairs for health under Barack Obama. President Trump had hailed him as "fantastic" when appointing him, and the Senate gave him the only 100-0 confirmation of the Trump team.
"If lawmakers fail to avert the fiscal cliff, 18 percent of the federal money that is sent to the states will be eliminated."	Delivering a speech in Newcastle on Thursday, he said: “At the moment, protectionism is largely just talk (and tweets). But what if rhetoric becomes reality?”
Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.
"In 2011, the average annual compensation for a teacher in the Milwaukee Public Schools system will exceed $100,000."	“We're really pushing 'vote your job,'” Priest said. “Public education is your paycheck and your passion, and you need to vote as though it is.”
Teachers might conceivably prove formidable candidates in suburban swing areas like the one that helped Democrat Ralph Northam win his race for governor in Virginia. And they’re logical torch-bearers for gun control, an issue that galvanized the left after the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Fifteen years ago, Oklahoma was ruled by Democrats — and it could be headed that way again. The Republican surge reached a critical point in 2004 when the GOP took over the Oklahoma House; in 2008, Republicans took control of the Senate, and in 2010 they seized the governor’s office.

Eric Young, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees’ Council of Prison Locals, now prays before he looks at his phone every morning, worried he’ll receive a message from BOP’s director notifying him of a staff death. Young estimates that around two-thirds of his union members were Trump supporters. That makes sense: It’s a law enforcement agency that leans white and male (72 percent male, 62 percent white), and many federal prisons are in rural parts of the country, which Trump dominated. But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau. BOP has long suffered the kind of problems you’d expect for a massive bureaucracy centered on caging tens of thousands of people.

Says U.S. Senate candidate Cory Gardner blocked immigration reform and voted to deport our DREAMers.	https://t.co/MtCTqZEWW7 — Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) June 28, 2018
Durbin’s advocacy for mass-migration and for younger ‘dreamer’ illegals has caused the Democrats much political pain. He pushed for the abortive budget-shutdown in January 2018, and for the “Gang of Eight” amnesty bill in 2013 which helped the Democrats lose nine seats in 2014. The Democrats’ top leader in the Senate, Sen. Chuck Schumer, is keeping his distance from the “Abolish ICE” campaign. He is instead using his Twitter account to tout Democrats’ promises on healthcare, guns, gay status, and claims that President Donald Trump is tied to Russian President Vladimir Putin. On the Abolish ICE campaign, Schumer is instead calling for a “czar” to focus media attention on “reunifying families.” That topic polls better for Democrats than ending immigration enforcement.
Says PolitiFact validated and independently documented its criminal history claims about Adan Ballesteros.	Ramos had an unsuccessful history suing the Gazette: In a 2012 suit, he claimed the newspaper defamed him after a columnist wrote about his 2011 guilty plea to criminal harassment. The suit was dismissed, and an appeals court affirmed the decision. Davis declined to provide details of the letters, but the Baltimore Sun, which first reported the documents, published a copy of one allegedly sent to the law office of the Capital Gazette's former attorney. NBC News has independently confirmed the authenticity of the document. Jarrod W. Ramos mugshot after his arrest on June 28, 2018 in Annapolis, Maryland.
Women make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns.	About four years ago, Dais had lined up a Chinese company to help develop its business in nanotechnology that helps produce clean water. Tangredi said the Chinese company persuaded a long-time Dais employee to defect with trade secrets. "They just stole it, and they are using it against us," he said. Tangredi said he hopes the threat of a trade war will force China to rethink its practices: "You've got to do something to get their attention."
About 800 people refused to get a drug screening because they are out there on drugs.	Any amount of prescription opioid use was correlated with greater involvement. Among people with prescription opioid use disorder, nearly 20 percent had criminal justice involvement. For heroin users, it was 40 percent. "People who use opioids, including heroin, were up to 13 times more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system," says Winkelman. The study shows the complexity of the the opioid crisis, according to Josiah Rich, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Brown University, who wasn't involved in the research.
Says Mitt Romney asked for a waiver from federal welfare rules.	"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.
Says Tom Hughes supports paving over thousands of acres with over-development and sprawl.	Having started out with a higher than average unemployment rate, Telford has since witnessed the arrival of major American, European and Japanese businesses: notably Hitachi, Denso, Maxell and Ricoh. Together they brought in thousands of high-technology jobs while the neighbouring Birmingham and Black Country conurbation was still rooted predominantly in traditional metal-based industries. Equally, there is no disguising the scale of the challenges the town has faced along the way. Sixteen years ago, the Commons select committee for transport, local government and the regions reported on new towns in general, but this could could easily have been about Telford in particular:
"While many new towns have been economically successful, most are now experiencing major problems. Their design is inappropriate for the 21st century.
Sen. Jack Reed cast the deciding vote in the Senate for the Affordable Care Act.	You've had Senators Joe Donnelly, Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp, who are the three red state Democrats who voted in favor of Neil Gorsuch, get their only personal meeting with President Trump and who say they are very open to confirming President Trump nominee who -- if the nominee is the right person. So those are the five senators who our attention is going to be really on for the next two months. BRENNAN: And what about immigration, Jan?

Details of the accusations are outlined in a confidential June 18 memorandum prepared by the Taft Stettinius & Hollister law firm at the request of legislative leaders.
Bill White ...offered sanctuary to illegal immigrants.	Breitbart News, especially, took notice of Nielsen’s role as chairwoman of World Economic Forum’s Global Agenda Council on Risk and Resilience. After Nielsen was nominated to run DHS, Breitbart published several pieces critical of her role in overseeing a 2016 annual report from the Global Agenda Council that directly addressed the worldwide refugee crisis. The report suggested that world leaders should seek to “change the narrative on refugees’ impact in host countries” so that the risks of refugee settlement are downplayed in favor of “the substantial social and economic contribution refugees can make to their host societies.” The report also cited studies showing a positive economic impact of $48 million to the local economy of Cleveland from refugees who had settled there. Work like that drew jeers from some of the right’s loudest voices when Trump nominated Nielsen for the DHS job. Ann Coulter called Nielsen an “open borders zealot.” Former deputy assistant to the president Sebastian Gorka said Nielsen “has a track record before coming into government of being pro-open borders.” Political operative Roger Stone called her “a neocon who likely did not vote for Donald Trump and certainly does not support his non-interventionist worldview.” And Breitbart News has dubbed her, among other things, “Lady DACA” and a “pro-amnesty, Bush bureaucrat.”
But if she lacked the border bona fides prized by the right, she possessed other qualities needed inside a White House lacking discipline and overwhelmed with infighting—namely a directness and and an intense focus.
Says the Clintons burst through their own self-pronounced guidelines by acceptingforeign donations.There is a clip of Bill Clinton saying were not going to take foreign donations.	Mrs May said she would not comment on a leaked report that the government had not yet seen. She said the government would consider it when it received it. (you can read the BBC story on it here)
She then said all donations to the Scottish Conservatives were accepted and declared in accordance with the law after Mr Blackford accused the party of "systematically shielding donations from public scrutiny". Referring to reports on the Ferret website, he alleged the Scottish Conservatives had received £319,000 from the Scottish Unionist Association Trust and said there was no information about who manages the trust, who its donors are or its assets. He urged the prime minister to reveal what checks had taken place before the money was accepted and for an investigation.
"Overall we currently have $981 million, almost a billion dollars in active development projects right here in the City of Richmond."	That came on the heels of 0.9 percent drop in March, the first monthly drop since July of 2017. Total private construction rose 0.3 percent, with residential projects up 0.8 percent in May. New single-family home construction rose 0.6 percent and the volatile apartment building sector jumped 1.6 percent. Private, non-residential building fell 0.3 percent. Economists are forecasting that construction spending will contribute to overall growth this year even though interest rates are rising.
"Sixty-two percent of all personal bankruptcies are ""caused by medical problems."""	"If we can work in partnership with them, they actually understand their children far more than we do in the NHS, and they can help us identify the potential children with issues early, but they need to build up understanding," Mr Hunt added. Mental and physical health - why the confusion? The issue of confusion with physical health problems, and a lack of being taken seriously over mental health, was also raised by those interviewed for the programme. One young teacher described her visits to the doctor and their refusal to believe her. Another interviewee called for parity with physical health.
China has made enormous progress in its human rights. That is a fact recognized by all the people in the world.	“Some of these articles feature exaggerations or overgeneraliszations [sic]; for example, some claim that China is ‘world No.1’ in certain field.”
The problem with these pieces, the People’s Daily argued in this column, is that “they lack basic facts and deep thought.”
Should Xi implement this reform in the tone of Chinese state media, it would mean a significant change for the typical styles of the nation’s largest publications. In 2017 alone, Chinese state publications proclaimed that the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse scandal proves that “Chinese traditional values” are superior to Western ones; the Soviet Union failed because it lacked “Chinese culture”; and that the West was doomed to fail because Western leaders “always believe in absolute conquest.”
An extensive profile of Xi Jinping in the state outlet Xinhua last year also went out of its way to proclaim that the world is riveted by Xi and his ability to “make things happen,” as evidenced by the “numerous clicks and many thumbs-up on the Internet” his speeches and political commentary garner. The story featured an anecdote about a man who drank some of the ink he was using to translate the Communist Manifesto because “the taste of truth is so sweet.”
Not to be left behind, in December, the People’s Daily proclaimed, “A unique path, a unique theory, a unique system, a unique culture; Xi Jinping’s thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era has developed a rich path for China that has transcended Western-centric theory.”
The growing human rights movement within China has also become one of the most common targets of vitriol for state media. Shortly following the death of Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo last year, the Global Times called Liu and his supporters “losers” and dismissed their lives as a “waste.”
The People’s Daily message this week may be aimed for North Korea as much as it is for China, as Pyongyang prepares for what appears to be inevitable economic profit following dictator Kim Jong-un’s in-person meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. North Korean state media are more vitriolic and exaggerated than their Chinese counterpart, spending much of 2017 threatening a nuclear attack on the United States and sentencing Trump to death.

Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.
"U.S. teenagers have now fallen behind their counterparts in Ireland, Poland and even Vietnam in math and science."	"People who use opioids, including heroin, were up to 13 times more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system," says Winkelman. The study shows the complexity of the the opioid crisis, according to Josiah Rich, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Brown University, who wasn't involved in the research. It shows "the spectrum of the disease and its overlap with the criminal justice system, showing that the more you progress along that continuum, the more likely you are to get tangled up in the criminal justice system." The study also showed that most people with opioid use disorder had other mental illnesses and were also more likely to have certain chronic health conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The study authors argue for the need to engage and involve the criminal justice system in dealing with the opioid epidemic, including reducing overdose deaths.

Melendez added that he'd even passed a phone interview with the president's son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner to suss out what he was calling about (he claimed it was about separating immigrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border). Trump called him back later that day. Melendez later said he was being investigated by the Secret Service and was being represented in the matter by Stormy Daniels' attorney, Michael Avenatti. He later told TMZ, "At the very least, what I did was expose how easy it is to infiltrate the White House.

Says Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor has animmigrant family background.	Jose Arizmendi, 54, a native of Mexico, pleaded guilty in April 1996 to aggravated sexual assault of a child in the District Court of Harris County, Texas … When the Department of Justice filed a complaint in federal court to initiate denaturalization proceedings in February 2015, Arizmendi was serving an 18-year prison sentence in Mexico for a separate sex offense of rape that he committed in that country. Araceli Martinez aka Maria Araceli Ramos de Martinez, 53, a native of Mexico, pleaded guilty in September 2012 to Obtaining Money, Labor or Property by False Pretense in violation of California Penal Code § 532(a) in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles. Between June 2011 and March 2012, Martinez engaged in a scheme in which she impersonated a U.S. immigration officer. Fosia Abdi Adan, 51, a native of Somalia, applied for and received a diversity visa from the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, Yemen, under the Diversity Visa (DV) Program on Jan. 10, 2001, and used her visa to unlawfully obtain beneficiary visas for the below individuals who were ineligible to be beneficiaries. Adan arrived and was admitted to the United States on Jan. 29, 2001, on her diversity immigrant visa as a permanent resident.
"Under the new Arizona immigration law, police can't stop someone to check their immigration status unless they think they see something illegal."	There have been numerous reports of concern among ICE agents. “Even the cops don’t like us anymore because they’re listening to the news also,” one ICE agent, who did not want his name used, told the Los Angeles Times. In California, many police departments have a longstanding policy against working with ICE to arrest people on immigration charges. The backlash against ICE has become so heated that senior officials in the agency’s criminal investigative division sent a letter to DHS Secretary Nielsen last month urging an organizational split of ICE. The letter, signed by the majority of special agents in charge of ICE’s Homeland Security Investigative Division (HSI), argued that the Homeland Security Investigative Division and ICE’s other division, Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), should be two separate organizations.

In turn, that means American firms in China could soon find their new product models at the bottom of the regulatory pile for things like safety approvals, or their state-owned Chinese partners might shift resources toward European joint ventures instead.

Freshman Rep. Moira Jayne Walsh, 27, who has been outspoken about what she sees as a culture of corruption in the State House, lost her party's endorsement to Michael Earnheart, who voted for President Donald Trump. As a safe blue state, Rhode Island rarely gets any national political attention. But Walsh woke up Tuesday to donations from as far away as Texas and California. Party officials describe Earnheart as a "lifelong Democrat" who voted for Trump because he didn’t like Hillary Clinton.
Just remember this: the presidents health care bill put 30 million people on health care rolls that werent there before.	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
Fox News uses photo of a married couple promoting traditional marriage and the photo is actually of a same-sex couple.	Bishop John Bauerschmidt, who oversees the Middle Tennessee region of the church, stands firmly by his decision not to authorize their use, nor allow clergy within his diocese to officiate the religious ceremonies or permit the weddings on church property. In doing so, the bishop says he is being faithful to his job of guarding the discipline, faith and unity of the church.

"The teaching that Christian marriage is between a man and a woman is reasonable, traditional, and scriptural," Bauerschmidt said in an email. "There really is nothing remarkable about a Christian bishop who holds to this teaching." While Bishops can place limitations on the use of the marriage liturgies, they must refer couples to a willing diocese if they do not authorize them.

Trump Management was charged with discriminating against African-Americans and breaking federal law.	Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease. Two aides who came with him from Oklahoma received massive raises Pruitt was later forced to reverse. He replaced the head of his security detail who wouldn’t let him use lights and sirens to zip around the city like the president. And a top career official was dismissed after he questioned the security justifications for Pruitt’s beefed up, multimillion-dollar protective detail.
China is or soon will be the largest English-speaking nation in the world.	ZTE is far from alone. China assembles some 90 percent of the world's smartphones, computers and other electronics. But most of the revenue flows to American companies that supply computer chips and other technology. In the broader economy, Chinese banks, airlines, farms and other industries need U.S. technology from jetliners to drugs to software. What Washington welcomes as a source of well-paid jobs, Chinese leaders consider a dangerous dependence.
The National Park Service has an annual budget that is less than the city of Austin.	Sixteen years ago, the Commons select committee for transport, local government and the regions reported on new towns in general, but this could could easily have been about Telford in particular:
"While many new towns have been economically successful, most are now experiencing major problems. Their design is inappropriate for the 21st century. Their infrastructure is aging at the same rate and many have social and economic problems...
"The new towns are no longer new and many of the quickly-built houses have reached the end of their design life. The master-plans dictated low density developments with large amounts of open space, and housing segregated from jobs, shopping and business services. These created car dependency and are now not considered sustainable.
It is ironic that (First Energy Corp. is) going to have a name on our (football stadium) where we (Cleveland Public Power) supply the electricity.	Infrastructure is supposed to knit us together as a nation, increasing our personal mobility and economic connectivity, but the politics of infrastructure is increasingly exposing our divides. ***
For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
"Congressman Jeff Denhamhas agreed all illegal immigrants should be detained, arrested and deported."	Since I don’t believe in magic, Isaac, that worries me. Can you explain a little bit about the politics of immigration within Mexico? He has been very careful about this topic, and he has been very careful when it comes to Trump. He says he will convince President Trump that it isn’t in his best interest to keep on adding to this nativist rhetoric.
"In 2011, more people were murdered with knives, hands or feet or clubs and hammers than with any type of rifle."	On this much police and activist South Side priest Michael Pfleger can agree: Saturday morning’s anti-violence march on the Dan Ryan Expressway is all about danger. Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.
"As governor, Tim Kaine oversaw a huge increase in illegal immigration, a tremendous increase."	“We are not going to fight. We are always going to seek for there to be an agreement. … We are going to extend our frank hand to seek a relation of friendship, I repeat, of cooperation with the United States.”
Trump was equally tactful, telling reporters: “I think he’s going to try and help us with the border. “I think the relationship will be a very good one,” the US president said of the Mexican politician, whose swearing-in will be in December. “We talked about trade, we talked about Nafta, we talked about a separate deal, just Mexico and the United States.”
Such restraint contrasted with Trump’s call to López Obrador’s predecessor, weeks after his inauguration last year.
Says Indiana Gov. Mike Pence provides zero state funding for homeless shelters.	Brayan remains in Maryland, where according to his grandmother he shares a room with 11 other children and is able to make a 20-minute phone call twice a week. The shelter is run the Board of Child Care in Baltimore, which is affiliated with the United Methodist Church, according to the program's website. It launched its migrant-child program in 2014, targeted at the time to unaccompanied minors who came to the U.S., to "offer care, safety, and support to a unique population in need," the agency's website says. ABC News reached out to the Board of Child Care but the agency declined to comment. Cáceres has been told that Brayan might be released around July 4, but, she said she has been given inaccurate or incomplete information before and is skeptical.
Virginias banning of felons from voting is a Jim Crow-era law.	Most were in their twenties, and some were couples, but otherwise, they fit no single profile. Only a little information about their fate has trickled out from the secretive North Korean regime. The full explanation of why they were taken remains a mystery.

XI ASSERTS TERRITORIAL CLAIMS IN MEETING WITH US DEFENSE SECRETARY
Chinese President Xi Jinping strongly asserted China's determination to defend territory it claims, including in the South China Sea, in a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. While the tone of Mattis' visit to Beijing was largely upbeat, Xi made sure to reinforce his reputation as a fervent nationalist when it comes to issues of sovereignty. Though Xi gave no specifics in his statement, he was largely seen as indicating the South China Sea as well as self-governing Taiwan. China also claims territory held by India and uninhabited East China Sea islands controlled by Japan.
Only one out of 10 minimum wage workers today are teen age or a young person.	About four years ago, Dais had lined up a Chinese company to help develop its business in nanotechnology that helps produce clean water. Tangredi said the Chinese company persuaded a long-time Dais employee to defect with trade secrets. "They just stole it, and they are using it against us," he said. Tangredi said he hopes the threat of a trade war will force China to rethink its practices: "You've got to do something to get their attention."

Change is not always bad, nor does it necessarily mean spending ungodly amounts of money.
SaysBernie Sanders has reversed his position on immunity for gun manufacturers and sellers.	So does a commitment to EPA’s mission," Natural Resources Defense Council President Rhea Suh tweeted. "Pruitt failed miserably on both counts. If his successor puts interests of polluters ahead of protecting public health, they will encounter the same wall of resistance, & meet the same fate." Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., called Pruitt "the worst EPA administrator in the history of the agency." "Instead of protecting our environment and combating climate change, he has worked to protect the interests of the fossil fuel industry and polluters all over the country," Sanders said in a statement.

Says we are going to sell this house and use the proceeds to stabilize rates.	Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.
"Says 15,000 IRS employees have to be added to administer ObamaCare and look at the tax implications."	Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
"As a senator, Hillary Clinton actually paid female staffers a lot less than men."	Hill denied the allegations in an emailed statement to IndyStar. Details of the accusations are outlined in a confidential June 18 memorandum prepared by the Taft Stettinius & Hollister law firm at the request of legislative leaders. The eight-page memo summarizes interviews that House and Senate leaders or their legal counsel conducted with six women who attended the end-of-session party at AJ’s Lounge, a bar just south of Downtown, during the early morning hours of March 15.

Teachers are also running a ballot measure campaign that would tax the highest income earners for an additional $690 million to spend on schools. “Regardless of political parties, we need people to make a decision about what’s happening in the classroom,” said Marisol Garcia, vice president of the Arizona Education Association. “To limit ourselves and to say ‘only these people are going to support us’ is just not true.”

Say easing restrictions on selling alcohol on Sundays will result in more traffic crashes and fatalities.	As motorists pay more to fill their tanks this Independence Day -- with gas prices at a four-year high for the holiday -- safety advocates are urging caution during celebrations that turn deadly on U.S. roadways. The national average for a gallon of gas on Tuesday stood at $2.86, making it the costliest for an Independence Day holiday in four years, according to AAA. That said, the nearly 40 million motorists expected to travel this week will pay 11 cents less per gallon at the pump than they did this past Memorial Day holiday, the motorist club noted. "The national gas price average has held fairly steady for the past 10 days, suggesting that U.S. demand is keeping pace with supply and stabilizing summer gas prices," a spokesperson for the motorist group said in a statement. "However, elevated crude oil prices and other geopolitical concerns could tilt gas prices more expensive in the early fall despite an expected increase in global crude production from OPEC and its partners."

Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.

"According to the CDC, 110 million Americans now have a sexually transmitted illness."	An interactive online HIV prevention program has reduced the sexually transmitted infection rates of gonorrhea and chlamydia by 40 percent among young gay and bisexual men, the first such approach to show an impact on sexual health, a new study found. The program, “Keep It Up!,” challenges traditional sexual education models and seeks to “keep up” HIV negative test results and educate racially and ethnically diverse at-risk gay and bisexual youth through soap operas, interactive games and real-world simulations. The program targets men 18 to 29 who have sex with men, a group that is disproportionately affected by HIV infections in the U.S. While this group represents only 2 percent of all young people, it accounts for 70 percent of HIV diagnoses according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Keep It Up!” is made up of different modules involving interactive games, exercises, a simulation at a bar and a soap opera.

Fillmore launched his career in the 1820s with the Anti-Masonic Party, hawking a paranoid rumour that ruling Freemasons were murdering whistleblowers.

Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.

If you discharge guns on a school yard, you can get out of jail free."	Of the three laws, the most prominent and most targeted by the Trump administration is SB 54, which California Gov. Jerry Brown signed in October and which went into effect Jan. 1. Provisions of the law bar local law enforcement officials from telling Immigration and Customs Enforcement when they will release certain individuals and from facilitating their transfer in most cases. AB 103 is a provision of a budget bill approved last year that allows the state to review federal detention of immigrants in the state. AB 450, which also went into effect Jan. 1, restricts private employers’ cooperation with federal immigration officials, requiring that businesses notify workers about employment documentation reviews and that immigration officials present a subpoena or warrant to enter workplaces.

His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Fred Knapp/NET News Fred Knapp/NET News
Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the Secretary of State Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. "Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago," says state senator Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the legislature.
Rick Perry advocated to liquidate the states rainy day fund in 2007.	Khalaf spent time in a camp for displaced people in northern Iraq before eventually relocating to Germany, where she lives now. Ahmed Khudida Burjus, the deputy director of Yazda, a U.S.-based Yazidi rights group, says around 7,000 women and girls were captured and sold into slavery, with nearly half eventually escaping. In Kocho alone, at least 500 men and boys were killed, and 800 women and girls taken away. The group has documented at least 54 mass graves of Yazidis, but says a lack of resources has delayed the exhumation of the remains, and that there may be more graves yet to be discovered. Over the past three years, Syrian and Iraqi forces have gradually driven IS out of nearly all the territory it once held.
"The Democratic health care plan is a ""government takeover of our health programs."""	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
Says Scott Walker says he would ban stem cell research	On this much police and activist South Side priest Michael Pfleger can agree: Saturday morning’s anti-violence march on the Dan Ryan Expressway is all about danger. Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.

"The top 10 most well-paid CEOs in America received a combined $770 million in 2010, while the average American workers wage rose just 2 percent."	That will allow Trump to argue that his tough approach to trade is paying off. There are reasons why the US economy is currently strong, but none of them have anything to do with tariffs on imports. In part, it is the lagged effect of a buoyant global economy in 2017; in part it is explained by tax cuts and the stimulus still being provided by only gently rising interest rates. Mickey Levy, chief US economist for Berenberg, says Trump’s deregulation agenda has been a factor in boosting America’s underlying growth rate. Evidence from Barack Obama’s presidency shows how protectionist policies can backfire.
A bill from U.S. Rep. Ted Yohoattempts to restrict the administrations ability to conduct national security and criminal background checks on undocumented immigrants.	Of the three laws, the most prominent and most targeted by the Trump administration is SB 54, which California Gov. Jerry Brown signed in October and which went into effect Jan. 1. Provisions of the law bar local law enforcement officials from telling Immigration and Customs Enforcement when they will release certain individuals and from facilitating their transfer in most cases. AB 103 is a provision of a budget bill approved last year that allows the state to review federal detention of immigrants in the state. AB 450, which also went into effect Jan. 1, restricts private employers’ cooperation with federal immigration officials, requiring that businesses notify workers about employment documentation reviews and that immigration officials present a subpoena or warrant to enter workplaces.

America owns 3 percent of the worlds oil but consumes 25 percent of its global reserves.	A marriage between a 41-year-old Malaysian Muslim man and an 11-year-old Thai girl prompted widespread outcry and calls for child brides to be banned as authorities launch an investigation. Che Abdul Karim Che Abdul Hamid secretly married his third wife in Thailand. The marriage was only made known after one of Che Abdul Karim’s wives lodged a complaint with police. The girl in question is set to meet with Malaysian officials Monday to discuss the marriage, authorities said. Deputy Prime Minister Wan Azizah Wan Ismail said the marriage was illegal because it hadn’t been approved by the Shariah court.
Air travelers cant get on a plane in the United States without someone doing a background check on them.	The woman who was flown back Thursday said she didn't know if she'd try it again. First, she needed to find out when her partner would be coming back. He was still detained in Texas. She borrowed a mobile phone to call a friend to get a ride to her small brick house that she thought she had left forever, a house containing the memories of her missing children, in a town under the grip of a gang. Asked who was waiting for her there, she looked bereft and answered weakly: "No one."
"Four percent of American citizens are black males, but they are 35 percent of murder victims."	The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year. The prison population has soared by 20% since the 2015 report. Almost half of all prisoners released reoffend and return to prison within two years. “As the government tightens sentencing and bail conditions, and builds more prisons, there is no indication that these trends are likely to change,” Glass said.

Suicide comes from federal government largesse saying you are not worth anything but you are going to get something for nothing.	And -- but I -- you know, one of the things I think that's really interesting that we've seen in the last year and half is these lower courts take a look at some of the president's policies is that you have federal judges -- one federal judge ruling a whole nationwide program unconstitutional. So a federal judge is essentially -- one federal judge, can be anywhere in the country, is setting federal policy. And the justices are really concerned about that. You saw Justice Thomas last week write separately, saying that the Supreme Court eventually is going to have to take this issue up, these nationwide injunctions being handed down by one federal judge.

A judge ordered federal emergency officials to extend vouchers for temporary hotel housing for nearly 1,700 Puerto Rican hurricane evacuees, saying ending the program could cause irreparable harm. Saturday night's decision came shortly after civil rights group LatinoJustice PRLDEF filed a lawsuit seeking relief for the Puerto Ricans, whose federal housing assistance vouchers were set to expire at midnight Sunday, meaning the evacuees could have been evicted from the hotels. The order says the agency cannot end its Transitional Sheltering Assistance program until at least midnight on Tuesday. The organization is pushing to let families stay another six months. U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin of Massachusetts wrote that ending the program would drain other public resources.

Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.

Earthquakes may now become easier to detect than ever before, with the aid of developing technology. Researchers in Iceland have successfully used an existing fibre-optic communications cable to assess seismic activity. Such cables are laid beneath the ground in countries around the world, to supply internet and television service. The technique has proven sensitive to ground shaking, but is not yet ready for widespread use. It joins a series of recent advances in earthquake sensing, including smartphone apps and more affordable detection hardware.
Teachers will not be able to return to work after raising their children.	Most of the incidents involved the amputation of fingers or fingertips, but there were recordings of lost hands, arms or toes. During the period there were a total of 550 serious injuries which cover 22 of the 50 states so the true total for the USA would be substantially higher. Recorded injuries include:
An employee’s left arm had to be surgically amputated at the shoulder after it was pulled into the cubing machine during sanitation
A worker was reaching down to pick up a box to clear a jam when his jacket became caught in a roller. As he tried to pull it out, his hand got pulled in as well. His hand and lower arm were crushed
While an employee was attempting to remove the ribs from the spine of a cattle rib set, his hand made contact with a running vertical band saw and two of his fingers were amputated
An employee working on a sanitation crew pushed the stop button after removing parts from the upper portion of a machine.

Can a carbon tax save the GOP? Climate change is one of many issues that divides the Republican Party.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
"Under Scott Walker, Wisconsin unemployments up from 4.8% to 6.2%"	Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) trashed the June jobs report — even though it showed rapid job growth, rising wages, and low unemployment. The report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that employers created 213,000 new jobs in June — 22,000 more than economists had expected. Manufacturing jobs in particular rose by 36,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.

Appointing Amul Thakar to the Supreme Court is an opportunity to make a bold outreach to the most prosperous of America’s immigrant communities and one that is increasingly important politically. The political benefits of naming Thapar are clear. Although Asian voters made up only 4 percent of the electorate in 2016, they are the fastest growing part of the electorate and a key factor in swing states such as Nevada (11 percent of the electorate) and Virginia (7 percent). Although they increasingly lean left, Republicans can get their votes. Nevada GOP Senator Dean Heller narrowly won re-election in 2012 by carrying 54 percent of the Asian vote.
"Wisconsins state budget is almost twice as large per person as the state budget of Texas, and even after billions in tax cuts, Wisconsins working families and businesses remain subject to a heavy tax burden."	The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.

Cindy Farquhar, postgraduate professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Auckland and senior author of the research, told the Guardian clinics should stop offering women endometrial scratches. “I think it is unreasonable for clinics to ask for patients to pay for something when there is now clear evidence that there is no added benefit,” she said. “I would hope that it will disappear from the list of add-ons that many clinics have both in the UK and in New Zealand and Australia.”
Stuart Lavery, a consultant gynaecologist at Hammersmith Hospital who was not involved in the study, said women who have recurrent implantation failure are hard to treat. “This mini-trauma offered a real potentially exciting way forward and it has become very widely adopted in international practice and in UK practice,” he said.

A medical transcriptionist would usually catch this type of error, notify us in the medical records office, and we’d then place a call to the doctor to confirm which leg they meant. Courtesy Abby Norman Working as a medical records clerk gave me an incredible amount of insight into our health care system -- insight that I now call upon as I adjust to life as a person with chronic illness. Sometimes, though, these errors made it into a patient’s official record, and it wasn’t always because someone just didn’t notice. Staff didn’t always have the proper privileges to make a correction, and if they even viewed a patient record, let alone made alterations to it, they could face disciplinary action. Ideally, computer systems would be able to automate these processes effectively and take humans out of the equation, giving doctors more time with patients.

WASHINGTON – If it's a holiday, it must be time for President Donald Trump to hit the golf course. Right on schedule, the presidential motorcade arrived at the Trump National Golf Club in suburban Virginia in the late morning, the middle of a day that also has the president tweeting and hosting a military-themed picnic later at the White House. As he departed the presidential mansion in the morning, Trump took to Twitter. In addition to a general salutation – "Happy Fourth of July....Our Country is doing GREAT!"

Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center, said that the center doesn’t weigh in on potential judicial appointees, but that open hostility to the agency’s mission would be cause for concern. “Obviously, it would be concerning if there was a justice that was inclined to invalidate the CFPB,” she said. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, renamed the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection under acting director Mick Mulvaney, returned nearly $12 billion to 29 million customers of financial services companies from 2011 to 2017 under its original director, Richard Cordray, an Obama appointee and former Ohio attorney general. But the CFPB’s structure — in fact, its very existence — has been a lightning rod since the agency’s inception. Opponents say not making the CFPB subject to the congressional appropriations process — it’s funded directly by the Federal Reserve — gives it unchecked power; supporters counter that having the central bank as its funding source protects the CFPB from partisan-driven attempts to starve it of resources.

TEHRAN, Iran – Iran on Sunday asked fellow OPEC members to “refrain from any unilateral measures” to increase oil production beyond the 1 million additional barrels of crude a day it already agreed to, a warning to Saudi Arabia after President Donald Trump said the kingdom would increase production. The Iranian warning, in a letter to the United Arab Emirates’ energy minister, comes as Tehran faces a U.S. push to get its allies to stop buying its oil as part of Trump’s decision to pull America from the nuclear deal with world powers. Meanwhile, Iran’s first vice president said the country’s private sector will be able to buy and export crude oil under a new plan to combat U.S. sanctions.

Brazil got off oil in the last 30 years.	— MINING: The EPA said last year that it won't require mining companies to prove they have the financial resources to clean up pollution, an Obama-era rule stemming from a long history of pollution spilling from abandoned mines into streams. Pruitt said modern mining practices and existing regulations made the financial requirement unnecessary and a burden on mining. — AUTOS: Pruitt's EPA has proposed freezing vehicle fuel-efficiency standards at 2020 levels for the next five years, according to a draft of the proposal obtained by Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del. For new vehicles, that means an average of about 30 miles per gallon instead of rising to 36 mpg by 2025 as Obama's EPA proposed. — OIL AND GAS: More than a dozen states are suing the EPA for failing to take action against leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, from oil and natural gas wells.
"Louisiana gets ""not one single penny"" from Gulf Coast offshore oil revenues."	The report says metallurgical coal export earnings are also forecast to decline over the next two years, by 5.7% to $35bn in 2018–19, and by another 11% to $32bn in 2019–20, as lower prices offset rising export volumes. Australia's high electricity prices the 'new normal', report says Read more
The metallurgical coal spot price is forecast to decline from an average of US$193 a tonne in 2018 to US$148 a tonne in 2020, with the impacts of improved supply combined with weakening demand from China expected to outweigh growing demand from India. The shadow energy minister, Mark Butler, said the figures from the report were being misrepresented. “Minister Canavan and PM Turnbull may think it’s their job to present this as a booming market, but the Australian people, especially those living and working in thermal coal communities, deserve to be treated with respect and intelligence,” Butler said. Turnbull refuses to rule out new coal-fired power stations Read more
“This is not a booming market, it is one in long-term structural decline as the world moves to lower-pollution forms of electricity generation to address climate change.

"For the first time in U.S. history, a personal inaction will be deemed unlawful -- not purchasing a health-insurance plan"	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., similarly warned on Twitter Monday that one of the judges on President Trump’s short-list would vote to “strike down pre-existing conditions protections in the ACA.”
It’s been nearly a year since Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voted against his party’s repeal-and-replace effort, with a dramatic early-morning thumbs-down that left longtime lawmakers gasping.
American colleges amount to a cartel.	"Jon's record is clear—if it's good for Montana, Jon works with anyone from either party to get things done. If it's bad for Montana, he'll stand up to anyone," Tester spokesman Chris Meagher said. "East Coast developer Matt Rosendale is only looking out for himself and whatever out-of-state special interest group that is propping up his campaign with cash. We can't trust him to defend Montana." But before Trump arrived in Montana, Tester's campaign took out full-page ads in newspapers across the state, highlighting bills the senator sponsored that Trump has signed into law.
"Louisiana is turning down $100 million ""that would require us to change our unemployment law, that would have actually raised taxes on Louisiana businesses."""	But that no-deportations policy would allow many companies to hire illegals instead of Americans. That subsequent rush of migrants would force down wages for Americans and for legal immigrants, force up rents and housing prices, and also overcrowd public K-12 schools.

Trump’s campaign to limit legal and illegal immigration is driving up wages and salaries for Americans in various locations and careers around the country.
Says he lived in a colonia while working as a farm worker.	He was, in other words, beginning to sound more like his tweets, and perhaps just a bit like Donald Trump. Brennan’s father, Owen, was a blacksmith who immigrated to New Jersey from Ireland in 1948. Owen’s own father, Brennan told me, was “a supporter, an affiliate, say,” of the Irish Republican Army. Brennan moved twice while growing up, from one apartment to another before settling in a three-family house in North Bergen. His grandmother lived on the top floor.
"Over the last 40 years, this countrys prison population has grown by 500 percent."	You can’t push any group of people that hard, that fast and for that long and expect them to maintain their composure.”
Eric Young, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees’ Council of Prison Locals, now prays before he looks at his phone every morning, worried he’ll receive a message from BOP’s director notifying him of a staff death. Young estimates that around two-thirds of his union members were Trump supporters. That makes sense: It’s a law enforcement agency that leans white and male (72 percent male, 62 percent white), and many federal prisons are in rural parts of the country, which Trump dominated. But Young said many of his Trump-supporting members are “quite upset” with what they’ve seen at the prison bureau. BOP has long suffered the kind of problems you’d expect for a massive bureaucracy centered on caging tens of thousands of people.
"While President Obama says all options are on the table for preventing a nuclear Iran, Hagel says military action is not a viable, feasible, responsible option."	It was President Obama who left his party in this position. His anti-business agenda was unpopular, but was never revisited. Democrats’ losses over the past decade stemmed in large part from a slow-growth economy that never gained momentum. Even though he received what he called a “shellacking” in the 2010 midterms, and even though the GOP made unprecedented political gains during his tenure, President Obama was always convinced the country was behind him. As Mara Liasson wrote for NPR in 2016: “During Obama's eight years in office, the Democrats have lost more House, Senate, state legislative and governors seats than under any other president.” She noted that the Obama legacy includes “one huge failure: a diminished Democratic Party.”
In 2013, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., invoked the so-called “nuclear option,” discarding traditional filibuster protections for the minority party in favor of requiring only a simple majority to approve judicial and executive branch nominees.
Bernie Sanderss plan is to raise your taxes to 90 percent.	The Philippine government will demand that peace talks with communist rebels shift from Europe to the Philippines and the insurgents are encamped in designated areas during the negotiations to peacefully settle one of Asia's longest-raging insurgencies. Presidential adviser Jesus Dureza said Thursday that New People's Army guerrillas would also be asked to stop collecting so-called "revolutionary tax" from companies and demanding to be part of a future coalition government. President Rodrigo Duterte's conditions were finalized in a meeting with top military and police officials late Wednesday. They're seen as likely to be rejected by the guerrillas, who fear that holding talks in Manila would expose them — including their Europe-exiled leaders — to military surveillance and harassment. The low-level, rural-based rebellion, which has raged since 1969, has left about 40,000 combatants and civilians dead, hampered security and economic development in the impoverished countryside for nearly half a century.
Says Russ Feingold broke his 1992 promise to always get the majority of funding from Wisconsin residents.	"Coming from a midwestern state, I think you need to be able to talk to the industrial Midwest. You need to be able to listen to the people there in order to win an election nationwide." Ocasio-Cortez responded on Twitter not much later, touting the midwestern states that Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., won in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary. With respect to the Senator, strong, clear advocacy for working class Americans isn’t just for the Bronx. Sen. Sanders won:

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.
More money is dedicated within the Department of Homeland Security to climate change than whats spent combating Islamist terrorists radicalizing over the Internet in the United States of America.	Can a carbon tax save the GOP? Climate change is one of many issues that divides the Republican Party. Like racial resentment, climate denial is a position held mostly by old, white, male conservatives. There’s a climate change generational, ethnic, and gender gap. 61% of Republicans under the age of 50 support government climate policies, compared to just 44% of Republicans over 50.
Says President Franklin Delano Roosevelt felt there wasnt a need in the public sector to have collective bargaining because the government is the people.	“These people see in Brexit the chance to turn Britain into the low-wage, deregulated, race-to-the-bottom society of their dreams. But Brexit is turning into a nightmare for the rest of us – a nightmare of uncertainty above all. The shadow of job losses is hanging over much of the British economy, including the jobs of tens of thousands of Unite members.”
Corbyn told delegates Labour was back as the political voice of the working class. “Labour exists to represent the large majority of the population, the many, not the few, lower and middle income voters, the skilled and unskilled, nurses and teachers, shop floor workers, builders, designers, technicians, professionals in every community, region and nation,” he said.
"Every time you buy an airline ticket, the federal government runs a background check on you."	Spokespeople for the Pentagon and the Army said that, due to the pending litigation, they were unable to explain the discharges or respond to questions about whether there have been policy changes in any of the military branches. Eligible recruits are required to have legal status in the U.S., such as a student visa, before enlisting. More than 5,000 immigrants were recruited into the program in 2016, and an estimated 10,000 are currently serving. Most go the Army, but some also go to the other military branches. To become citizens, the service members need an honorable service designation, which can come after even just a few days at boot camp.

Belfast City Council has become the first council in Northern Ireland to set up a committee specifically to deal with Brexit.

It will be responsible for "researching, monitoring and reviewing the financial, resource or operational impact" of Brexit on Belfast. Its first meeting will be on 9 August. While the UK as a whole voted to leave the EU in June 2016, a majority in Northern Ireland voted to remain.

NEW YORK, NY - MAY 30: Michael Cohen, (C) former personal lawyer and confidante for President Donald Trump, exits the United States District Court Southern District of New York on May 30, 2018 in New York City. According to a filing submitted to the court Tuesday night by special master Barbara Jones, federal prosecutors investigating Michael Cohen, a longtime personal lawyer and confidante for President Donald Trump, are set to receive 1 million files from three of his cellphones that were seized last month.

BREAKING ... ABC NEWS' GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS SPOKE TO MICHAEL COHEN: "Michael Cohen says family and country, not President Trump, is his 'first loyalty'": "When I asked Cohen directly what he would do if prosecutors forced him to choose between protecting the president and protecting his family, he said his family is 'my first priority.' "Cohen added: 'Once I understand what charges might be filed against me, if any at all, I will defer to my new counsel, Guy Petrillo, for guidance.' Story Continued Below
"But when I pointed out to Cohen that he wasn’t repeating past vows to 'take a bullet' and 'do anything' to protect the president, the longtime Trump loyalist left little doubt about where he stands now, saying simply: 'To be crystal clear, my wife, my daughter and my son, and this country have my first loyalty.'

LONDON — Over the past century American and British troops have fought side-by-side in two World Wars, Korea and the conflicts in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan. But some lawmakers and experts in the United Kingdom are warning that the British military could soon be seen as irrelevant by the United States unless it receives a colossal funding boost. "There is a concern that the U.K. is falling ever further behind and becoming even more useless from a U.S. point of view," said Andrew Dorman, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a think tank in London.
"In the past year, DeKalb has attracted and retained more than 2,300 jobs."	The economy has added an average 207,000 jobs a month this year after a blowout number of 223,000 in May. Economists predict that 195,000 jobs were added in June. Unemployment stands at 3.8%, the lowest rate since 2000. If it dips to 3.7%, it will be the lowest since 1969.
"Two years ago...I wrote to Secretary Paulson, I wrote to Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, and told them [subprime lending] is something we have to deal with."	Federal Reserve officials last month said they expect to keep raising interest rates and suggested that by the next year, they could be high enough that they could start slowing growth, according to minutes of their discussion released Thursday. While noting a strong economy, Fed officials appeared vigilant about emerging risks, especially trade tensions, and the dangers of an economy that might overheat. The officials noted heightened concerns from businesses about President Donald Trump's get-tough trade policies and that some executives had already scaled back future spending plans because of the uncertainty. They also said they were monitoring changes in market-set interest rates. A narrowing in the gap between short-term and long-term rates has been an accurate predictor of downturns in the past.
Manufacturing is having its best employment year in almost 15 years.	The services sector, where most Americans are employed, has now expanded for 101 consecutive months, or more than eight years.

Georgia ranks No. 9 in the rate of women murdered by men.	Practice is only one of Deborah Glass’s 125 recommendations not accepted by Victorian government
Female prisoners in Victoria are still subject to “abusive” routine strip searches, a state government watchdog says. The Victorian ombudsman, Deborah Glass, said the government has failed to adopt a recommendation from her 2015 report into the prison system that called for an end to the searches. “Why has the government not accepted my recommendation to stop the abusive practice of routinely strip-searching women prisoners – in fact, the only recommendation out of 125 not accepted?” she asked on Wednesday. The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year.
Bicycle ownership drops by half while obesity in Rhode Island rises by 154 percent	They are to consult on detailed plans to restrict the promotion and marketing of foods high in salt, sugar and fat. This would target confectionary, biscuits, crisps, cakes, pastries, sugary soft drinks and potentially ice creams, and include restrictions on multi-buy offers, meal deals, unlimited refill deals and where products can be displayed in shops. Newly appointed public health minister Joe Fitzpatrick said "far too many people" were facing "serious risks to their health" which were "largely avoidable". 'Profound impact'
The new government report states that "the Scottish diet remains stubbornly unhealthy", with the country "far from meeting our dietary goals" - something which has a "profound" impact on health and lifestyle. Problems start early, with the report setting out "alarming" findings on the number of children consuming food and drinks high in fat or sugar - studies suggest 29% of children are at risk of being overweight, half of whom are at risk of obesity.
"Sue Lowden gave Harry Reid's campaigns a thousand dollars in five different elections, helping his Senate dreams come true."	Even Pruitt’s own staff had begun to sour on him, with many worrying that their future career prospects would be damaged by their association with Pruitt’s tenure. Each scandal seemed more damning than the last. Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.
A gay man who survived #orlando hate crime can STILL show up to work in FL tomorrow and have his boss fire him simply because he is gay.	No one was ever arrested for the blaze, although Fieseler writes about how investigators keyed into one main suspect in the fire — a disgruntled bar patron who'd been kicked out earlier in the day and had been heard threatening to burn the place down. It wasn't until 2003 that a plaque commemorating the fire's victims was laid. New Orleans was a conflicted place for the gay community at the time of the fire, Fieseler says. In some ways, the city was a haven for the gay community where people could be themselves. But there were also raids on gay bars, harassment, and discrimination: "An individual who was quiet and who was closeted gay, could find companionship, could find love and joy, could have a job, could have a house, so long as this individual never spoke the dreaded H.

Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, one of the most powerful conservatives in Congress, has denied reports that he ignored the alleged sexual abuse of athletes while he worked as an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University more than 20 years ago. Allegations that Jordan was aware of sexual misconduct and explicitly was informed of specific incidents of alleged assault by the wrestling team's doctor, first surfaced in an NBC news story on Tuesday. But Jordan — who was an assistant coach from 1987 until 1995, when he was elected to the state legislature — has refuted the claims. "Congressman Jordan never saw any abuse, never heard about any abuse, and never had any abuse reported to him during his time as a coach at Ohio State," Ian Fury, Jordan's spokesman, said in a statement. "He has not been contacted by investigators about the matter but will assist them in any way they ask, because if what is alleged is true, the victims deserve a full investigation and justice."Rep.

Portland Schools spend $500K to deem PBJ sandwiches racist.	PORTLAND, Ore. -- Two opposing protest groups -- Patriot Prayer and antifa -- clashed in downtown Portland Saturday, CBS Portland affiliate KOIN reports. Portland police said failure to leave the area could leave to arrests, calling the demonstration a riot. More than 100 members of Patriot Prayer group gathered at Terry Schrunk Plaza for a "freedom rally," while more than 100 counter protesters with an antifa group gathered across the street at Chapman Square for rallies before a march. Police revoked Patriot Prayer's permit for the rally after the two groups began to clash. People were lighting firecrackers and smoke bombs in the crowd while police used flash bangs in an effort to disperse the clashing protesters.
"Says these Jersey Shore folks, theyre from New York."	Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.

His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections.

"Historically, the Social Security tax has been assessed on about 90% of U.S. income. Now it captures 83% because theres been such a growth of income among the highest earners."	Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop.

"While in the Illinois Senate, Barack Obama passed legislation moving people ""from welfare to jobs."""	Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) tweeted a still more vague yet somehow more expansive vision Tuesday, calling for “restructuring the agencies that enforce our immigration laws, including ICE.”
Such aspirationalism allows establishment Democrats to harness the power behind the idea of abolishing ICE without taking a meaningful position on the underlying goal that animates that movement ― to radically undercut the government’s deportation efforts.
Gov. Terry McAuliffe has made several statements that he would love to be in a Cabinet secretary position with the Clinton administration.	He initially explained that the meeting was held to discuss Russian adoptions, which were suspended after the US announced sanctions on Russia in 2012. But emails showed that he decided to attend the meeting after being offered damaging information about Hillary Clinton. He and President Trump have since described the meeting as "opposition research" that any politician would engage in. Eric Trump

Fox News again dominated for the second quarter of 2018 not only in cable news, but in all of cable, while CNN landed in last place by a country mile. For the eighth straight quarter, Fox was the most-watched network in all of cable. With an average of 1.409 million total day viewers, Fox attracted nearly as many eyeballs as MSNBC and CNN combined. MSNBC averaged just 930,000 viewers, while CNN nosedived with an average of just 658,000. During primetime, Fox snagged an average of 2.447 million viewers, compared to MSNBC’s 1.736 million.
Says the U.S. Department of Homeland Security must report to about 100 congressional committees and subcommittees.	Despite the ban, police allowed the organizers to read a press statement. “We do not recognize this ban,” the group said in the statement read out loud by a volunteer, calling the prohibition imposed by Istanbul’s governor “comical.”
Police told the crowd to disperse after the statement, warning “otherwise, we will intervene.” Officers patrolled with dogs and had water cannons stationed nearby. They fired tear gas on groups in some areas and were seen elsewhere pushing and shouting at participants who were too slow to scatter. March organizers said Friday that the governor had prohibited the march in violation of the right to freedom of assembly. The governor has cited security reasons and public “sensitivities” as grounds for barring LGBTI marches since 2015.
"Every American now is $51,000 in debt. Thats money I owe, thats money my children owe before they even go to kindergarten, thats their check to the federal government right now."	The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.
The Republican candidate [John Loughlin] has talked about privatizing Social Security ... so we know where he stands on the issue.	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”

"Says cuts by Gov. Rick Perrys administration left 12,000 teachers without a job."	Hamilton, the Republican state lawmaker who beat the incumbent Karnes, won with a mix of support from teachers and other unions. While Karnes sparred with teachers during the strike, Hamilton took a moderate position. He aligned with teachers unions by opposing state right-to-work legislation and the proposed repeal of prevailing wage laws for public construction projects. The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.

Independent groups behind ads attacking Democratic candidates are front groups for foreign-controlled companies.	Corporate America couldn’t hire Republican lobbyists fast enough after President Donald Trump’s election gave the GOP unified control of Washington. Now there are signs that Democrats are back in demand. Companies and trade groups are trying to hire congressional staffers with ties to influential House Democrats four months ahead of the midterm elections, in which Democrats are expected to pick up seats and potentially retake control of the House. Lobbyists are helping their clients meet with the Democrats who would become committee chairs if the party does win back the chamber. And trade groups are talking to members about what to expect from a Democratic takeover.
Says Donald Trump supports an agenda out there to privatize the Veterans Affairshealth care system.	Watts was transported to a nearby hospital, where 85 to 90 percent of his body was found to have been burned, Georgia State Patrol told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Authorities said Watts, upset with the federal agency designated to aid veterans, attached a homemade incendiary device and fireworks to his body before pouring liquid on himself. He then ignited the fluid. VETERAN PROTESTING TREATMENT BY VA SETS HIMSELF ON FIRE NEAR GEORGIA STATE CAPITOL, POLICE SAY

Each scandal seemed more damning than the last. Pruitt faced criticism last year for his extensive first-class travel on the taxpayer dime and security expenses including a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office. Then news this spring that Pruitt had secured a $50-a-night Capitol Hill condo lease from the wife of a lobbyist kicked off several months of damaging headlines on a nearly daily basis. His staff talked of getting him a $100,000-a-month private jet lease.

In its statement, Delancey said it remained committed to ensuring the continued maintenance of the centre but added that it was over 50 years old, “and as is often the way with older buildings, some elements do unfortunately fail”. The delay in repairing the escalator was because it was so old, spare parts were no longer made and had to be specially manufactured, the spokeswoman said. The shopping centre has long attracted scorn and been dismissed as an eyesore – not least because of its “manky, hot-pink” exterior, as Time Out once put it – but some see that as part of its charm, with the Guardian’s property section once describing it approvingly as the “anti-Westfield”.

Dean chuckled along as Leyonhjelm said Hanson-Young “has the right to shag as many men as she likes”. This show appears designed to be unfair and ugly and angry. It has nothing to do with “basic human decency”, so it is far easier to scapegoat a junior producer than admit the program was working entirely as planned. A day later, the hosts issued an on-air apology, saying the senator had crossed a line and seeking to disassociate themselves from “unverified rumour and innuendo” about Hanson-Young’s private life.

XI ASSERTS TERRITORIAL CLAIMS IN MEETING WITH US DEFENSE SECRETARY
Chinese President Xi Jinping strongly asserted China's determination to defend territory it claims, including in the South China Sea, in a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. While the tone of Mattis' visit to Beijing was largely upbeat, Xi made sure to reinforce his reputation as a fervent nationalist when it comes to issues of sovereignty. Though Xi gave no specifics in his statement, he was largely seen as indicating the South China Sea as well as self-governing Taiwan. China also claims territory held by India and uninhabited East China Sea islands controlled by Japan.

Says the mandate is 71 times that a childs body will be injected with a disease for immunizations.	Any amount of prescription opioid use was correlated with greater involvement. Among people with prescription opioid use disorder, nearly 20 percent had criminal justice involvement. For heroin users, it was 40 percent. "People who use opioids, including heroin, were up to 13 times more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system," says Winkelman. The study shows the complexity of the the opioid crisis, according to Josiah Rich, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Brown University, who wasn't involved in the research.

“The same sort of thing is true for a place like New York,” Frey added. “There has always been huge movement going from New York to Florida, but during the Great Recession period that slowed up quite a bit, and now it is picking up again.”
Frey added that the reasons behind the decline in population in cities like Los Angeles and New York -- overcrowding and high prices -- are very different than the reasons for decreases in other cities on this list, notably Rust Belt cities like Flint, Michigan; Toledo, Ohio; and Rockford, Illinois; and even larger cities like St. Louis, Cleveland, and Milwaukee. These cities have been losing domestic migrants for decades due to stagnating economic conditions stemming from the decline of American manufacturing. Methodology
To identify America’s Fastest Declining Cities, 24/7 Wall Street reviewed the annual estimates of resident population and the estimates of the components of residential population change from April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2017, provided by the American Community Survey.

"Under Gov. Scott Walker, Wisconsin projected a $1 billion (budget) surplus and it turns out to be a deficit of $2.2 billion."	Economists have warned the import tariffs could disrupt the supply chain, undermine business investment and raise prices for consumers, and wipe out the stimulus from a $1.5 trillion tax cut package that came into effect in January. “As with the manufacturing report released on Tuesday, there was plenty of anecdotal evidence that tariffs were beginning to have an impact, but with the prices balance falling in June and new export orders rising, there is little sign that this is affecting the economy yet,” said Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York. TRUCK DRIVER SHORTAGE
Services industries also complained about difficulties finding qualified workers, especially truck drivers, which some said was “getting worse each month.” There are a record 6.7 million unfilled jobs. The ISM survey’s measure of service industry employment slipped in June, but continued to show growth. Some industries said they “need to hire more people,” and others noted that “employee retention is getting much more competitive.”
Separately, the ADP National Employment Report showed private employers hired 177,000 workers in June, less than market expectations for a 190,000 gain.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

"Never once did they (House Republicans) actually cut spending or reduce the state budget. Even when they cut taxes in 2005, they increased spending. They never paid for their tax cuts."	'We’re going to run different'
His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.

A senior Pentagon official during the Obama administration, Denmark worries that with President Trump's suspension of a major military exercise with South Korea next month, North Korea's already gotten a lot and given up very little. "Kim Jong Un did not make any new commitments in Singapore, and so the secretary of state is now forced to go into Pyongyang, trying to secure something that the president was not able to," says Denmark. "The real question is whether Kim Jong Un is genuinely interested in denuclearization." Trump, for one, apparently thinks he is. "I made a deal with him.

The fallout from the teacher protests is even reaching deep-red Arizona. One hundred fourteen Democrats will compete in the Aug. 28 primary for legislative seats — the most on record, according to the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. Teachers are also running a ballot measure campaign that would tax the highest income earners for an additional $690 million to spend on schools. “Regardless of political parties, we need people to make a decision about what’s happening in the classroom,” said Marisol Garcia, vice president of the Arizona Education Association. “To limit ourselves and to say ‘only these people are going to support us’ is just not true.”

Jeff Burke, APS director of resources planning, says customers would see 6 to 14 percent per year increases on their bills if the company is forced to ratchet up renewable use ahead of schedule. "We continue to add renewables to our system, but they have to make sense," Burke said. "It's not really about a target, it's about what makes sense for our customers' usage and what makes rates affordable and what keeps our system reliable." Thirty-two states with renewable standards didn't have, on average, a correlated rate increase, according to Wesley Hersche, an associate director of research with Arizona State University's Global Security Initiative. "These issues involve a complex interaction of factors, and we should be careful not to oversimplify things," Hersche wrote in April.
The Nordic countries are some of the few countries that meet development aid goals.	In the lead-up to the upcoming NATO summit in Brussels, President Donald Trump has reportedly sent “sharply worded letters” to the leaders of several NATO allies, escalating his long-simmering feud with the military alliance. The New York Times reported Monday that the letters, sent last month to leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Prime Minister Charles Michel of Belgium, rebuked NATO allies for not spending enough on their own defense ― a criticism that Trump has repeatedly leveled against other alliance members. The president also suggested in the letters that the U.S. would consider reducing its military commitment globally if its allies don’t ramp up spending, reported the Times. In his letter to Merkel, Trump reportedly wrote: “There is growing frustration in the United States that some allies have not stepped up as promised. The United States continues to devote more resources to the defense of Europe when the Continent’s economy, including Germany’s, are doing well and security challenges abound.
"Tells David Cicilline, 94 percent of the carbon emissions which you so want to get rid of are caused by nature."	Abbott said on Tuesday night he never conceived of climate change as a moral challenge. “It was an issue, that’s all, and – at least on the actual changes we’ve so far seen – not a very significant one compared to man’s inhumanity to man; maintaining and improving living standards; and even to many other environmental issues such as degraded bush and waterways, particulate pollution, water quality in the third world, deforestation and urban overcrowding.”
He contended that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide from roughly 300 to 400 parts per million over the last century had not triggered “dramatic consequences”. Play Video 0:32 Andrew Probyn calls Tony Abbott 'destructive' in ABC report – video
“Storms are not more severe; droughts are not more prolonged; floods are not greater; and fires are not more intense than a century ago – despite hyperventilating reportage and over-the-top claims from Green politicians,” he said. “Sea levels have hardly risen and temperatures are still below those of the medieval warm period. Over time, temperature change seems to correlate rather more with sun spot activity than with carbon dioxide levels.
Sen. Barbara Boxer voted against immigration reform to permit (Hispanic immigrants) people to come here legally to work.	Despite the current growth prospects and inflation finally reaching the Fed's goal of 2 percent annual gains in prices, the minutes noted a number of "risks and uncertainties" facing the economy. Officials said that the risks associated with trade policy had "intensified," with the uncertainty potentially hurting business sentiment and investment spending." The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and has also threatened to impose tariffs on billions of dollars in other Chinese products including tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese goods which are scheduled to take effect on Friday. Beijing has promised to retaliate with tariffs on U.S. goods, including farm products such as soybeans. Trump has staked out a tougher approach on trade in an effort to achieve his goal of dramatically shrinking America's huge trade deficits, which he has blamed for the loss of millions of U.S. factory jobs.
Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate.	That's more than all but three Democratic senators (Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana), all of whom are from red states and facing re-election this fall. "I think he's terrific," Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., who also faces a tough re-election fight, said in an interview. "It's harder work when you're not interested in voting the party line. You've got to look at every issue from all sides." "I really have been pleasantly surprised how willing he is to tell Chuck Schumer to go fly a kite," she added, referring to the Senate minority leader.

When Shyaira Dineen was in first grade, a teacher of hers told her to mark her race as African-American on a standardized test. Dineen remembers that day clearly because she says it confused her. She has a black mother and a white father. "I didn't argue with her," says the 23-year-old, but she did think it was weird. "Why do I feel like I only have to choose one?
The only growth sector that weve had in the last two years in America is government growth.	The services sector, where most Americans are employed, has now expanded for 101 consecutive months, or more than eight years. The gain was better than many economists had been expecting and depicts an overall economy that appears to be regaining momentum after a slowdown in the winter.
Who will raising the minimum wage actually help? More than half work full-time. The average worker is 35 years old.	San Francisco became the first California city to implement a $15 minimum wage ordinance for all businesses on July 1. The union-backed “Fight for $15” claimed Seattle as the first city to pass a $15 minimum wage ordinance in June 2014. The movement created a groundswell, and 17 percent of Americans will live in a metropolitan area or a state with a $15 minimum wage by 2023, including the State of California. Bay Area Labor Council union leaders, elected officials, and social justice activists that worked to pass Proposition J in 2014 with the support of 77 percent of voters celebrated in a Friday afternoon rally at City Hall. There were lots of speeches claiming that the “Fight for $15’”movement has economically and socially benefited 142,000 workers.
Fifty percent of the graduating class of the year 2012 will have smoked marijuana or have done illegal drugs.	Any amount of prescription opioid use was correlated with greater involvement. Among people with prescription opioid use disorder, nearly 20 percent had criminal justice involvement. For heroin users, it was 40 percent. "People who use opioids, including heroin, were up to 13 times more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system," says Winkelman. The study shows the complexity of the the opioid crisis, according to Josiah Rich, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Brown University, who wasn't involved in the research.

"As has been noted by many observers, including Bill Clinton's former secretary of labor, my plan does more than anybody to reduce costs."	In “Go for Growth, Fellow Dems” (op-ed, June 29), Tony James urges Democrats to embrace many Republican positions. He likes tax cuts, sensible regulation, supporting businesses, and addressing the unequal tariffs between the U.S. and our trading partners. Alas, he is wasting his time trying to shift the views of the Democratic Party, which has become ever more left-wing, if not outright socialist. I think it is time for Mr. James to become a Republican. Guy Randolph

It’s shocking that Mr. James is surprised by the positive economic results of less regulation and lower taxes.
The public option is not funded with public money. It's funded with private insurance premiums.	But, unlike the wind industry which has settled on a three-blade design, underwater designers are also testing four and six-bladed versions too. OpenHydro, already deployed in Canada’s Bay of Fundy, use giant 16m hoops with inward-pointing blades that resemble the mouth of a giant lamprey fish. Its makers opened the world’s first tidal turbine manufacturing plant in Cherbourg last week. There are also vertical turbines that spin like a fairground carousel, such as Hydroquest in France and LHD in China, and one company is even making an undulating membrane inspired by swimming fish. Capturing wave power is even more challenging than tapping the tides – “survivability” is the key term in this sector.
"Thirty-eight states -- Georgia not included -- have appointed, rather than elected, state school superintendents."	There never was a rational reason for creating a “buffer zone.” This attendance status allowed enrollment at either Central or South high schools. Hinsdale High School District 86 history shows that buffer zone residents chose Central attendance at a 9 to 1 ratio compared to the choice for South. Yes, it is a fact that buffer zone status did increase property values.The two board members voting not to eliminate buffer zone status live within those attendance boundaries. This June 1, a discrimination complaint was filed against District 86 with the United States Office of Civil Rights. The complaint cites (1) unlawful discrimination due to fixing unlawful attendance boundaries, (2) continued expansion of those boundaries, as well as (3) curricular disparity between the two high schools.

Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. LONDON — Over the past century American and British troops have fought side-by-side in two World Wars, Korea and the conflicts in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan. But some lawmakers and experts in the United Kingdom are warning that the British military could soon be seen as irrelevant by the United States unless it receives a colossal funding boost. "There is a concern that the U.K. is falling ever further behind and becoming even more useless from a U.S. point of view," said Andrew Dorman, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a think tank in London.

In his first loss — by a mere 0.56 percent to conservative Felipe Calderon in 2006 — his supporters held months-long protests in Mexico City and he referred to himself as "the legitimate president." His allies are warning even before Sunday's presidential vote that there better not be any funny business. "They shouldn't dare commit a fraud, because if they do they will meet the devil," said Yeidckol Polevnsky, president of Lopez Obrador's Morena party. "We will not accept it." Still, the voting Sunday was by and large peaceful, apart from the usual complaints about some volunteer-staffed polling places opening late.

"Says food stamp growth, while high, lagged the rise in unemployment."	The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) spent a total of $4 billion on improper food stamp payments to those receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the USDA confirmed with Breitbart News on Friday. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service announced this week that improper payments made up 6.3 percent of SNAP money in the fiscal year (FY) 2017—the latest data available from the agency. Breitbart News analyzed the USDA’s data on food stamp spending and found that $4,007,026,532 of the $63,603,595,754 the agency spent on SNAP in FY 2017 went to improper payments. The USDA told Breitbart News that “it is important to note that improper payments include both overpayments and underpayments,” meaning that households on SNAP that received less than what they were supposed to receive for the month are also included in the percentage rate. Brandon Lipps, the Acting Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services at the agency, said that most improper payments are due to “human errors”—either because of state agencies miscalculating benefits or benefit recipients giving state agencies the wrong information.The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) spent a total of $4 billion on improper food stamp payments to those receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the USDA confirmed with Breitbart News on Friday.

From Friday afternoon to early Monday, 21 people were wounded and two people were killed, including a 14-year-old boy who was shot early Saturday while walking in the Washington Park neighborhood, according to police. About nine hours earlier, another 14-year-old boy was shot in the Loop. He was coming up stairs at the corner of Wabash Avenue and Wacker Drive when he was shot in the leg Friday evening, police said. Late Sunday night, three girls ages 5, 14 and 15 were shot while sitting in a parked car with their mother in the East Garfield Park neighborhood, police said.

Democrats by 20-1 agree that “the American economy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful.” Republicans narrowly agree. Republicans by 20-1 agree that “the mainstream media is more interested in making money than telling the truth.” Democrats agree with the statement, too, though by a narrower 5-3.

"Women in Oregon are paid 79 cents for every dollar paid to men.

We look at other parts of the world, where women are not allowed to vote, or dance, and we see ourselves as modern and liberated. But all our “freedoms” are fairly recent, from being able to get a mortgage to being protected from rape in marriage. The narrative of progress is one that too many liberals imbibe, but it is untrue. In many of the areas to which we turn when we measure gender equality, we have not moved forward for the past 10 years – income, political engagement, education.

Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods.

In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.

"For anybody whos trying to cross the street and has seen those signs that say you have to stop when pedestrians are in the crosswalk, that was a bill that I passed."	And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday. “I can’t predict anything right now, but we’re taking a page from the civil rights movement. When nothing else was working, civil disobedience is what eventually made authorities and the government listen.”
Law enforcement officials have asked Pfleger to reconsider, saying the protesters are putting their lives on the line by walking onto a busy expressway. In fact, Illinois State police troopers, who have jurisdiction over Chicago expressways, will try to stop protesters from getting on the Dan Ryan — and arrests will be made, if necessary.

Despite no signs of North Korea abandoning its nuclear weapons any time soon, South Korea is literally bouncing ahead this week with peace efforts with its rival, which was threatening war just months ago. Two days of friendly basketball games winding up Thursday in Pyongyang were the latest in a slew of goodwill gestures between the Koreas in recent months. The women's and men's matches came just ahead of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's arrival in North Korea on Friday for two days of talks over the future of the North's nuclear program. A capacity crowd of 12,000 applauded as the teams — dressed in white jerseys that read "Peace" and green jerseys that read "Prosperity" — marched onto the court holding hands. Players from the North and South were mixed into teams for Wednesday's games.

“This was probably the best term that conservatives had in the supreme court maybe in my lifetime,” he said. The term might provide only “a very, very modest preview” of waves of conservative rulings to come, however, because a locked-down conservative majority would likely inspire rightwing activists to bring increasingly aggressive cases, said Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. “It’s not just that justice Kennedy’s successor is likely going to move the court to the right,” Vladeck said.

Scott Pruitt is out but his impact on the environment will be felt for years
Scott Pruitt, who has finally stepped down as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency after a long-rumbling corruption scandal, rose to public prominence on the back of a series of increasingly outlandish ethical controversies. Scott Pruitt resigns: Trump's scandal-ridden EPA chief steps down Read more
From lobbying fast food company Chick-fil-A on behalf of his wife, to demanding his staff acquire a mattress from a Trump Hotel – not to mention the millions of taxpayer dollars spent on security, first-class travel and soundproof booths – Pruitt’s behavior clashed spectacularly with any pretense of Trump’s pledge to “drain the swamp” in Washington. But the lasting legacy of the former Oklahoma attorney general – who was picked by Trump after crusading against what he called the EPA’s “activist agenda” – is likely to be felt in the systematic weakening of environmental regulations. While not as eye-catching as, for example, his demand that his official vehicle use sirens so he could reach a French restaurant on time, Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left behind a demoralized agency where staff fret that their ability to protect public health has been diminished. A staunch ally of oil and gas companies, Pruitt stacked EPA advisory boards with industry representatives and sought to set aside whole troves of research that link pollution to various illnesses.

Says Ron Wyden spent $2 million to study exotic ants.	The liberal high school teacher ousted a 24-year incumbent who served as House majority leader in 2016. Now, the state party has endorsed a professor at a Catholic University who signed a letter supporting Ireland's abortion ban, which was recently overturned. "Quite frankly, they are not used to women of color, black women, standing up," Ranglin-Vassell said. Democratic state Rep. Teresa Tanzi, standing, talks with Democratic Rep. Marcia Ranglin-Vassell during the legislative session In Providence, Rhode Island, on Jan. 9, 2018.

"Its just been announced that the residents of Florida are going to experience a massive, double-digit premium hike."	Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.
"For a young man or woman who is entering the ninth grade in Newark this year, they have a 29 percent graduation rate."	"We don't underestimate the impact that the deaths of these young people will be having in the community and we would ask that people focus on supporting each other and supporting the police investigation."
Van Jones signed a petition indicating he thinks the Bush administration blew up the World Trade Center and covered it up.	Abbott said on Tuesday night he never conceived of climate change as a moral challenge. “It was an issue, that’s all, and – at least on the actual changes we’ve so far seen – not a very significant one compared to man’s inhumanity to man; maintaining and improving living standards; and even to many other environmental issues such as degraded bush and waterways, particulate pollution, water quality in the third world, deforestation and urban overcrowding.”
He contended that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide from roughly 300 to 400 parts per million over the last century had not triggered “dramatic consequences”. Play Video 0:32 Andrew Probyn calls Tony Abbott 'destructive' in ABC report – video
“Storms are not more severe; droughts are not more prolonged; floods are not greater; and fires are not more intense than a century ago – despite hyperventilating reportage and over-the-top claims from Green politicians,” he said. “Sea levels have hardly risen and temperatures are still below those of the medieval warm period. Over time, temperature change seems to correlate rather more with sun spot activity than with carbon dioxide levels.
"The federal government owns 30 percent of the land in the 50 states, or about 650 million acres."	A look at recent developments in the South China Sea, where China is pitted against smaller neighbors in multiple disputes over islands, coral reefs and lagoons in waters crucial for global commerce and rich in fish and potential oil and gas reserves:

EDITOR'S NOTE: This is a weekly look at the latest developments in the South China Sea, the location of several territorial conflicts that have raised tensions in the region. ———
XI ASSERTS TERRITORIAL CLAIMS IN MEETING WITH US DEFENSE SECRETARY
Chinese President Xi Jinping strongly asserted China's determination to defend territory it claims, including in the South China Sea, in a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. While the tone of Mattis' visit to Beijing was largely upbeat, Xi made sure to reinforce his reputation as a fervent nationalist when it comes to issues of sovereignty. Though Xi gave no specifics in his statement, he was largely seen as indicating the South China Sea as well as self-governing Taiwan. China also claims territory held by India and uninhabited East China Sea islands controlled by Japan.
Says Bernie Sanders was against the auto bailout and voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry.	President Donald Trump is not responsible for the killing of journalists in Annapolis last week. His belittling of the press — his “enemy of the American people” taunts, his promises to roll back libel laws, his fomenting rage toward specific journalists at rallies — is worth mentioning within the context of the murders, because it speaks to a larger concern that last Thursday’s attack on The Capital Gazette won’t be an isolated incident. Journalists, many of whom already risk their lives covering war and violence, many of whom receive death threats regularly, feel understandable jitters about a leader who tries to turn the American public against us, particularly when we watch a member of that public shoot up a newsroom and end five lives. It’s reckless and inaccurate, though, to pin the shootings on Trump. The suspect swore an oath to kill a Capital writer who wrote about him in 2011.
"Because the EPA closed a lead smelter in Missouri, all lead for bullets will have to come from overseas!"	Those factories are the core of an American operation that employs about 136,000 people, but they're also dependent on components sourced overseas for reasons of cost or availability. About 70 percent of the parts in a U.S.-built Camry, the country's best-selling car, come from domestic suppliers. Toyota on June 27 said that Trump's threatened 25 percent tariff on automotive imports would add $1,800 to the price of each sedan. The carmaker's warning of the dangers of tit-for-tat tariffs was just one of many. German lighting manufacturer Osram Licht's shares plunged 22 percent Thursday after it announced a weaker outlook due to trade tensions.
"Ken Hodges badly botched this investigation and, as a result, justice wasnt done in this case."	The court documents detail the accounts of four unnamed women, identified as Jane Does 1, 2, 3, and 4. Local reports cited depositions that Large took before his death wherein he reportedly admitted to suggesting some of the women participate in "catfight videos" for money, but he denied the claims of sexual assault. Now his five of his former supervisors, police department, and Horry County officials are facing claims from two of the victims, Jane Does 3 and 4, for allegedly failing to prevent years of egregious abuse. Large died in January, 16 months after he was indicted. On Monday, a judge rejected a motion for summary judgment from the defendants and decided the case would move forward with a trial against the Horry County Police Department and Horry County.
"Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have the identical position on health care, which is they want to put the government in charge of you and your doctor."	“They’ve twisted American values,” she said in a follow-up phone interview. “A lot of them are anti-God, anti-religion and anti-military.”
In the survey, most say they are proud to be Americans, although Republicans feel that way more strongly (90 percent) than Democrats (61 percent). There is no consensus when asked about the country’s current course, though: 71 percent of Republicans but just 22 percent of Democrats said they are proud of America right now. “Overwhelming majorities of those in both parties and independents agree that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.”” USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll
The USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll of 1,004 adults, taken online June 26-27, has a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The survey is one of a year-long series on American values.
The minimum wage is lower right now than it was when Ronald Reagan took office.	About four years ago, Dais had lined up a Chinese company to help develop its business in nanotechnology that helps produce clean water. Tangredi said the Chinese company persuaded a long-time Dais employee to defect with trade secrets. "They just stole it, and they are using it against us," he said. Tangredi said he hopes the threat of a trade war will force China to rethink its practices: "You've got to do something to get their attention."
"In our community college system (state) cuts have reduced funding per student by $1,908."	The University of Missouri is still facing enrollment and budgetary problems, including a $49 million budget shortfall, as a result of the 2015 social justice protests that caught national media attention. Many people remember the high-pitched yell of former University of Missouri professor Melissa Click. Click found herself at the center of weeks of unrest at the University of Missouri in 2015 and 2016. Click rose to infamy after a video of her calling for a student photojournalist to be physically removed from campus simply because he was documenting the protests. The protests involved accusations by students that the administration had mishandled several alleged racial issues on campus.
The Atlanta Braves are the oldest continuously operating professional sports franchise in America.	As they were looking around, they noticed a moose at the pond and they both said how amazing it would be if that was the backdrop to their wedding photos. Sure enough, just before the couple’s first kiss as husband and wife, they heard something behind them. ‘I start seeing guests kind of looking that way and I’m just wondering what the commotion is and I look over and I see people kind of moving really fast and I see a moose right there.’ Shandy said the moose seemed more curious than aggressive, but everyone, including the pastor, made sure to be cautious of their surroundings.”
AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…
“Yes, I know that the world is going to pieces and that the prowess of three gifted players doesn’t amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. But I remind you that FDR wanted baseball to continue during World War II. I make no claim that elegance and grace on any field will ward off the apocalypse.
"After they bought GST Steel, Mitt Romney and his partners loaded it with debt, closed the Kansas City plant and walked away with a healthy profit, leaving hundreds of employees out of work with their pensions in jeopardy."	Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.
"You have 200,000 to 400,000 military veterans on the street in this country on any given day."	Pentagon Questioned Over Blackout On War Zone Troop Numbers
Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images
For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.
The New York Times writes this long story about Donald Trumps tax returns but didnt point out there was no wrongdoing until paragraph 18.	No one was ever arrested for the blaze, although Fieseler writes about how investigators keyed into one main suspect in the fire — a disgruntled bar patron who'd been kicked out earlier in the day and had been heard threatening to burn the place down. It wasn't until 2003 that a plaque commemorating the fire's victims was laid. New Orleans was a conflicted place for the gay community at the time of the fire, Fieseler says. In some ways, the city was a haven for the gay community where people could be themselves. But there were also raids on gay bars, harassment, and discrimination: "An individual who was quiet and who was closeted gay, could find companionship, could find love and joy, could have a job, could have a house, so long as this individual never spoke the dreaded H.
"In renewable and advanced energy manufacturing projects, Ohio now ranks first among the 50 states."	Nuclear wouldn't count toward the 50 percent mandate, and APS says its Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station is the largest electricity producer in the U.S.
Jeff Burke, APS director of resources planning, says customers would see 6 to 14 percent per year increases on their bills if the company is forced to ratchet up renewable use ahead of schedule. "We continue to add renewables to our system, but they have to make sense," Burke said. "It's not really about a target, it's about what makes sense for our customers' usage and what makes rates affordable and what keeps our system reliable." Thirty-two states with renewable standards didn't have, on average, a correlated rate increase, according to Wesley Hersche, an associate director of research with Arizona State University's Global Security Initiative. "These issues involve a complex interaction of factors, and we should be careful not to oversimplify things," Hersche wrote in April.

The academic achievements of our student-athletes are mentioned in the same breath and spirit as Notre Dame and Stanford.	Maryanne Trump Barry, the president's sister, served with him until her retirement. He drove a taxi to get through law school, and his degrees from Notre Dame and Georgetown give him a non-Ivy League appeal. Minuses: His star appears to be fading. A limited paper trail on the appeals court worries some conservatives. He is not known as a great legal theorist like Kavanaugh, nor is he a "feeder judge" whose law clerks are snapped up by Supreme Court justices.
Because of Barack Obama 32 million new people will have healthcare.	There have been numerous reports of concern among ICE agents. “Even the cops don’t like us anymore because they’re listening to the news also,” one ICE agent, who did not want his name used, told the Los Angeles Times. In California, many police departments have a longstanding policy against working with ICE to arrest people on immigration charges. The backlash against ICE has become so heated that senior officials in the agency’s criminal investigative division sent a letter to DHS Secretary Nielsen last month urging an organizational split of ICE. The letter, signed by the majority of special agents in charge of ICE’s Homeland Security Investigative Division (HSI), argued that the Homeland Security Investigative Division and ICE’s other division, Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), should be two separate organizations.
"Right now, we only keep 50 percent of Georgia Techs graduates."	“After all, it’s just a computer algorithm that’s just spitting all this out to begin with, based on so-called comparable sales.”
Most funding for tuberculosis research (is) provided by the U.S. National Institutes for Health.	Liberated in March from immigration detention, where disease and threats were allegedly rife, he had been sent to a city ravaged by decades of civil war and terror. He told me his story but asked for his real name to be withheld as he feared being targeted by the Islamist al-Shabab group because of his work warning young people in the US about the dangers of recruitment by Somali militants. 'TB contracted in detention'
Six months earlier, in a small town in Minnesota - which is home to the largest population of Somalis living in the US - it was dawn when Ahmed was driving his daughter to nursery. He noticed a large vehicle with tinted windows beginning to follow him. It seems officers from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) had been watching him closely and, after getting him to pull over, he was shackled and taken into custody.
"An amazing 5,400 jobs were lost in the first 12 months of the (smoking) bans implementation in Ohios hospitality industry alone."	"For a good few years we did see a decrease in the number of young people reportedly taking substances. "But over the last 12 to 18 months we have seen a slight increase."
"Says Mexico doesnt have birthright citizenship, and Americans are the only ones to have it."	Just hours after his historic election victory sent thousands of supporters pouring on to the streets, the 64-year-old leftist tweeted that he had received a call from Donald Trump. “I proposed that we explore an integral agreement of development projects, which generate jobs in Mexico and with that reduce migration and improve security. There was respectful treatment and our representatives will speak more.”
In an interview with the Televisa news network, López Obrador emphasized the need for mutual respect and cooperation between the two neighbors. “We are conscious of the need to maintain good relations with the United States. We have a border of more than 3,000 kilometers, more than 12 million Mexicans live in the United States.
After Massachusetts passed a mandatory health insurance law their mortality rate went down...it saved lives.	Kinner was being held without bail at the Ada County jail on 15 charges, including six of injury to a child and nine of aggravated battery, jail records showed. There was no lawyer listed for Kinner in the records. Kinner may have wanted to “extract vengeance” for being kicked out by a tenant who took him in, Police Chief Bill Bones said at a press conference on Sunday. The woman who took Kinner in was not harmed and was not at the residence at the time of the attack. Kinner assaulted the children at the party after he was unable to find the woman, police said, adding his motive was still under investigation.
"The Orange County, Florida, school board voted to make it impossible for a student to receive a grade below 50."	There never was a rational reason for creating a “buffer zone.” This attendance status allowed enrollment at either Central or South high schools. Hinsdale High School District 86 history shows that buffer zone residents chose Central attendance at a 9 to 1 ratio compared to the choice for South. Yes, it is a fact that buffer zone status did increase property values.The two board members voting not to eliminate buffer zone status live within those attendance boundaries. This June 1, a discrimination complaint was filed against District 86 with the United States Office of Civil Rights. The complaint cites (1) unlawful discrimination due to fixing unlawful attendance boundaries, (2) continued expansion of those boundaries, as well as (3) curricular disparity between the two high schools.
Richmond is the most vegan-friendly city.	Yet those people were served. And since it is in Virginia, was Sanders even the first member of the Trump administration to eat there? Maybe others less recognizable had already come and gone. As for “compassion,” what compassion are you showing for someone who, for all you know, may struggle with certain elements of her job herself? What compassion are you showing in a country where the Supreme Court just ruled on gay customers being denied services in a cake shop, yet your gay staff members want you to refuse service to someone they don’t like?
"In 2012, Connie Mack missed 178 votes, one of the worst voting records in Congress."	He aligned himself with most of his Democratic colleagues against Gina Haspel, Trump's pick for CIA director, arguing that her record on enhanced interrogation techniques was unacceptable. And instead of focusing on a politically safe issue in his maiden Senate floor speech, Jones struck a nerve by calling for a dialogue on gun violence after the mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida. In addition, during the campaign, Jones made no secret of his desire to protect LGBTQ rights and to support a woman's right to abortion. It's those kinds of positions that have made him a darling of Alabama's progressive minority — and somewhat of a public enemy among the state's conservative majority. Jones has introduced four pieces of legislation — none of any huge significance — since he arrived on Capitol Hill, including two agriculture bills, one that would expand access to capital for rural job creators and the last seeking to mandate an annual Medicaid expansion review.
"Senator Obama's relatives and friends say he has been talking about running for president for at least the last 15 years, a campaign spokesman said."	He said he supports the project and wants to see it succeed “more than anybody.”
Moore said he knows Obama dating back to the former president’s days as an Illinois state senator running for Congress, driving with him to community meetings and even going as a surrogate for him once or twice.

Durbin’s advocacy for mass-migration and for younger ‘dreamer’ illegals has caused the Democrats much political pain. He pushed for the abortive budget-shutdown in January 2018, and for the “Gang of Eight” amnesty bill in 2013 which helped the Democrats lose nine seats in 2014. The Democrats’ top leader in the Senate, Sen. Chuck Schumer, is keeping his distance from the “Abolish ICE” campaign. He is instead using his Twitter account to tout Democrats’ promises on healthcare, guns, gay status, and claims that President Donald Trump is tied to Russian President Vladimir Putin. On the Abolish ICE campaign, Schumer is instead calling for a “czar” to focus media attention on “reunifying families.” That topic polls better for Democrats than ending immigration enforcement.
Wendy Davis opposes any limits on abortion.	The president told Fox News that he believes his nominee will get some support from Democrats. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, an abortion rights supporter, is considered one of the key votes on a nominee. She said she wouldn't vote for someone who would overturn Roe v. Wade. "A candidate who would overturn Roe would not be acceptable," she said Sunday on ABC's This Week. Collins, who has previously bucked party lines on other key issues such as health care, said she plans to have an in-depth conversation with the nominee.
"Thats legal: If you find out about somebody elses salary even if youre doing exactly the same job, you can be retaliated against, including being fired, in most places."	“I will not be a punching bag as part of anyone’s defense strategy,” he said emphatically. “I am not a villain of this story, and I will not allow others to try to depict me that way.”

“I respect the prosecutors.
The United States has experienced 40 straight months of unemployment at 8 percent or higher.	The services sector, where most Americans are employed, has now expanded for 101 consecutive months, or more than eight years. The gain was better than many economists had been expecting and depicts an overall economy that appears to be regaining momentum after a slowdown in the winter.
The president released all of the oil from the Strategic Oil Reserve.	The most-active Brent LCOc1 futures contract for September delivery settled up 48 cents at $78.24 per barrel. U.S. crude futures CLc1 were up 19 cents at $74.33 a barrel, within sight of Tuesday’s 3-1/2-year high above $75 a barrel. The U.S. market will not have a settlement price due to the U.S. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani appeared on Tuesday to threaten to disrupt oil shipments from neighboring states if Washington continued to press all countries to stop buying Iranian oil.
91% of suspected terrorists who attempted to buy guns in America walked away with the weapon they wanted.	But that no-deportations policy would allow many companies to hire illegals instead of Americans. That subsequent rush of migrants would force down wages for Americans and for legal immigrants, force up rents and housing prices, and also overcrowd public K-12 schools. Polls show that no-deportations policy is radioactive among swing voters and ut congressional actions show it is quietly supported by many GOP and Democratic politicians . B
Trump’s campaign to limit legal and illegal immigration is driving up wages and salaries for Americans in various locations and careers around the country.
"If President Obama signs the Copenhagen climate change treaty, he ""will sign your freedom, your democracy, and your prosperity away forever and neither you nor any subsequent government you may elect would have any power whatsoever to take it back again."""	While not as eye-catching as, for example, his demand that his official vehicle use sirens so he could reach a French restaurant on time, Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left behind a demoralized agency where staff fret that their ability to protect public health has been diminished. A staunch ally of oil and gas companies, Pruitt stacked EPA advisory boards with industry representatives and sought to set aside whole troves of research that link pollution to various illnesses. He oversaw the delay or destruction of dozens of clean air and water rules, sparking legal battles with states and environmental groups. The EPA’s record in court under Pruitt was patchy but his deregulatory zeal was enough to impress Trump, who said Pruitt was doing a “fantastic job” even as scandals that sparked more than a dozen different investigations swirled around him. Pruitt became a trusted advisor to Trump, helping convince the president the US should withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.
"If Congress fails to act, the Obama administration intends to give away control of the internet to an international body akin to the United Nations."	China Mobile has reportedly been censoring content banned by the Chinese government’s “great firewall,” even when Chinese citizens are in the United States — prompting the FCC to debate its license. According to the Washington Post, on Monday, the U.S. Department of Commerce “recommended the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) deny a license to China Mobile, the state-run company that is the world’s largest phone network by subscribers.”
“The Commerce Department suggested the move because of the national security risk China Mobile poses,” they explained, adding that China Mobile is an “arm of the Chinese state,” and that “those with China Mobile as their carrier are often unable to access American websites and apps that are banned in China.”
One Chinese journalist was reportedly unable to access Facebook, the New York Times, and Google Maps from their phone while in the United States. Another user, Shanghai analyst May Sun, warned that the “Great Firewall” doesn’t stop when you enter the United States as a Chinese citizen. “[It] is exactly the same as when you surf on the Internet at home,” May Sun declared. “You still don’t have access to what is blocked by the Great Firewall.”
In a statement, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) called China Mobile an “unacceptable risk.”
“Granting the authorization poses an unacceptable risk to U.S. national security and law enforcement,” NTIA proclaimed.
Labor union president Andy Stern is the most frequent visitor at the White House.	So let’s be clear - you have no shared plans,no tourist business consultation and no agreement with the Scottish Gov. — Fiona Hyslop (@FionaHyslop) July 4, 2018 Report
On Wednesday, Mr McVey said the council had "engaged pretty consistently" with the government, adding: "Fiona Hyslop said any scheme would require engagement with the industry and that's exactly what we're doing. "We have taken a far more robust and professional approach and I've noticed a huge amount of openness to the idea in some quarters that were fairly dismissive of our previous attempts as a local authority." The Scottish Conservatives - who oppose having a tourist tax scheme - said the exchange was "an embarrassing split right at the top of the SNP", with Ms Hyslop "slapping down" Mr McVey "in full public view".
The U.S. has over $62 trillion in unfunded liabilities.	That will allow Trump to argue that his tough approach to trade is paying off. There are reasons why the US economy is currently strong, but none of them have anything to do with tariffs on imports. In part, it is the lagged effect of a buoyant global economy in 2017; in part it is explained by tax cuts and the stimulus still being provided by only gently rising interest rates. Mickey Levy, chief US economist for Berenberg, says Trump’s deregulation agenda has been a factor in boosting America’s underlying growth rate. Evidence from Barack Obama’s presidency shows how protectionist policies can backfire.
We now do have evidence that Donald Trump is being used as a recruiting tool for terrorists.	POLITICO Playbook: Michael Cohen speaks
NEW YORK, NY - MAY 30: Michael Cohen, (C) former personal lawyer and confidante for President Donald Trump, exits the United States District Court Southern District of New York on May 30, 2018 in New York City.

BREAKING ... ABC NEWS' GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS SPOKE TO MICHAEL COHEN: "Michael Cohen says family and country, not President Trump, is his 'first loyalty'": "When I asked Cohen directly what he would do if prosecutors forced him to choose between protecting the president and protecting his family, he said his family is 'my first priority.' "Cohen added: 'Once I understand what charges might be filed against me, if any at all, I will defer to my new counsel, Guy Petrillo, for guidance.' Story Continued Below
"But when I pointed out to Cohen that he wasn’t repeating past vows to 'take a bullet' and 'do anything' to protect the president, the longtime Trump loyalist left little doubt about where he stands now, saying simply: 'To be crystal clear, my wife, my daughter and my son, and this country have my first loyalty.'
... study after study has shown that the death penalty deters murders.	In addition, five women experienced excessive pain and two had excessive bleeding. Cindy Farquhar, postgraduate professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Auckland and senior author of the research, told the Guardian clinics should stop offering women endometrial scratches. “I think it is unreasonable for clinics to ask for patients to pay for something when there is now clear evidence that there is no added benefit,” she said. “I would hope that it will disappear from the list of add-ons that many clinics have both in the UK and in New Zealand and Australia.”
Stuart Lavery, a consultant gynaecologist at Hammersmith Hospital who was not involved in the study, said women who have recurrent implantation failure are hard to treat. “This mini-trauma offered a real potentially exciting way forward and it has become very widely adopted in international practice and in UK practice,” he said.

Many people remember the high-pitched yell of former University of Missouri professor Melissa Click. Click found herself at the center of weeks of unrest at the University of Missouri in 2015 and 2016. Click rose to infamy after a video of her calling for a student photojournalist to be physically removed from campus simply because he was documenting the protests. The protests involved accusations by students that the administration had mishandled several alleged racial issues on campus.
An attack on a healthy 22-year-old homosexual man would be more protected under the law than an attack on an eight-year-old child.	Cult activities escalated after the defeat of Aum members in the 1990 parliamentary election. During their bizarre election campaign, Asahara and his top disciples sang and danced to the guru's songs. In June 1994, the cult spread sarin gas in Matsumoto in central Japan, killing eight people and injuring more than 140 others, in an attack targeting residents who were protesting the cult's presence in their neighborhood and court officials handling their legal disputes. Nakagawa and key members produced sarin at a cult compound and sprayed it from a van, in what was later regarded as an experiment for the subsequent subway gassing. Under intensifying scrutiny from the government, the cult plotted the larger sarin attack on the subways in Tokyo on March 20, 1995.

In response to Mr Javid's comments, Russia said the British government was subjecting them "to hell". Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova urged police not to be led by the "dirty political game" and said she was confident London would have to apologise to Russia.

"By voting for Obamacare, Sen. Kay Hagan voted to kill the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs."	In one case, Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting opinion that illegal immigrants do not have the same bargaining rights as American citizens and legal workers. “… an illegal immigrant worker is not an ’employee’ under the NLRA for the simple reason that, ever since 1986, an illegal immigrant worker is not a lawful ’employee’ in the United States,” Kavanaugh wrote. In another case, Kavanaugh noted that American multi-national corporations do not have the right to import foreign workers. The Circuit judge explained, “Under the provision of the immigration laws at issue here, mere economic expediency does not authorize an employer to displace American workers for foreign workers.”
Prominent conservative Ann Coulter has also called for Trump to nominate Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, arguing that other judges such as Thomas Hardiman and Raymond Kethledge “are open borders zealots.”

"The Keystone oil pipeline would employ 20,000 people in the United States."	"The cost that implies is just not realistic." Trump's singular focus on reviving manufacturing is, in some ways, at a right angle to the true nature of the U.S. economy. Service industries employ more than 10 times as many Americans -- about 125 million -- as manufacturing does, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The figure includes about 19 million jobs in healthcare and social assistance, almost 16 million in leisure and hospitality and 16 million in retail. Services include most of America's corporate stars, from Alphabet Inc. to Goldman Sachs, and are unquestionably globally competitive: the country exported about $255 billion more in services than it imported last year.

"Barack Obama, right now, No. 1, over seven years has dramatically degraded our military."	Pentagon Questioned Over Blackout On War Zone Troop Numbers
Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images
For more than a decade, if you wanted to know how many U.S. troops there were in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, you could readily find that information at a public Pentagon website that's updated every three months. But since late last year, the Pentagon's stopped posting those numbers for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. That public information blackout, along with the recent suspension of Pentagon reports on airstrikes and collateral damage in Afghanistan, has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill raising red flags. "What's your view on the detail of the information that should be released?," Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed asked Lt. Gen. Scott Miller at his June 19 confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Miller assured Reed, the Senate Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, that if confirmed, he would be "very transparent" about what's going on in Afghanistan during appearances before Reed's oversight panel.
"Says the Club for Growth tries to defeat Republicans, and that its president called Nancy Pelosi the person I respect the most in Washington."	The list of Democrats expressing frustration with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has been growing longer in recent weeks, but don’t expect to see former President Barack Obama’s name on it. At a party fundraising event Friday afternoon in Northern California, Obama spoke highly of Pelosi – and even predicted that she will return to the job of House speaker after November’s midterm elections. “I think everybody knows how much I love Nancy Pelosi,” Obama told the gathering at a home in affluent Atherton, Politico reported. "Nancy, I believe, is one of the greatest speakers we ever had, and will once again be one of the greatest speakers we ever have after we get through this cycle," he continued. “And there's not much I could have gotten done without having Nancy there alongside of me every step of the way.”

"Says if you are on your bike in a crosswalk, all you have to do is dip your wheel into the road and cars must legally stop."	On this much police and activist South Side priest Michael Pfleger can agree: Saturday morning’s anti-violence march on the Dan Ryan Expressway is all about danger. Pfleger — and perhaps hundreds of others — plan to shut down traffic on the expressway to send a message: Elected leaders must fix neighborhood schools and create better job prospects to supplant the violence plaguing some pockets of the city. In 2016, gun violence reached levels that had not been seen in 20 years, according to data kept by the Tribune. And while the number of shootings victims has decreased since then, it’s still higher than 2015 and 2014. “We’re still on target to go,” Pfleger told the Tribune Thursday.

Two-thirds of the top-rated hospitals in Florida were our hospitals.	Straight-A students are being turned away from British medical schools and forced to pay for training in Eastern Europe, while the National Health Service (NHS) plunders the Third World for already-trained doctors instead. The Daily Mail spoke to a number of star students who earned top A-levels and supplemented their CVs with spells volunteering at local GP surgeries, overseas clinics, hospices, and pharmacies — and even earned degrees in related fields such as Biomedical Science — who were turned away from British medical schools, despite the NHS facing a shortfall of some 10,000 doctors. Department of Health and Social Care figures show that only 6,000 of 18,000 medical school applicants were awarded places last year — with many of the 6,000 likely going to foreign applicants, who have often been favoured over British applicants. In fact, the Mail found that so many talented would-be medical students were being rejected that a cottage industry of English-language medical schools in countries such as Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Armenia, and Georgia have sprung up to cater to them — but even this option is not available to youngsters who cannot afford the fees.

Says Donald Trump says organized crime runs wild on reservations.	Nearly 600 more retail jobs are to go in the UK as the Jacques Vert, Windsmoor and Precis department store brands are wound down by administrators. Administrators said they had failed to find a buyer for Calvetron Brands, which had been restructured following a rescue deal last summer. The business entered administration in May and had already shed more than 400 jobs before Wednesday’s announcement. The latest retail job losses come as more than 30,000 jobs are at risk in the UK following mass closure announcements by major chains including House of Fraser, New Look and Marks & Spencer. Retailers are suffering from rising costs and the switch to online shopping just as hard-pressed consumers rein in spending.

Split those revenues, with 35 percent going to K-12 education, 35 percent to roads, 15 percent to the communities that allow marijuana businesses in their communities and 15 percent to counties where marijuana business are located.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.
A proposed immigration bill will bankrupt Georgia if passed.	Multiple proposed travel bans were stayed by federal courts. Congress has passed various immigration laws; some have been interpreted to allow the executive to restrict immigration the way Trump has, while other interpretations suggest that he cannot.

That does not mean Trump will be nice about it; it does not mean the absence of absurd, scurrilous and misleading tweets. It simply means that the legal process will be obeyed.

Community banks are being destroyed by Dodd-Frank.	Among those reported to be among the top of President Donald Trump’s short list is Judge Brett Kavanaugh on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The prospect of a Justice Kavanaugh worries some consumer advocates, who say he has taken an activist position against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the regulator implemented in the wake of the Great Recession in the hopes of thwarting future financial meltdowns. “Kavanaugh’s track record has shown tremendous sympathy to political rhetoric, more so than to established precedent as it relates to the Bureau,” said Aaron Klein, director of the Center on Regulation and Markets at the Brookings Institution. “His ruling was closer to congressional talking points than legal precedent.”
Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center, said that the center doesn’t weigh in on potential judicial appointees, but that open hostility to the agency’s mission would be cause for concern. “Obviously, it would be concerning if there was a justice that was inclined to invalidate the CFPB,” she said.

Murphy, who served as former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Germany, wants to take New Jersey in a more liberal direction after eight years of Republican Gov. He’s for higher taxes on the wealthy, free community college, rehabilitating New Jersey‘s beleaguered transit agency and continued generous benefits for public workers. Sweeney had a working relationship with Christie that proved beneficial to his power base in South Jersey. And while he supported virtually all of the programs Murphy proposed, his message — which he’s taken to Fox News and Fox Business Network — was about eventually reducing New Jersey’s taxes, among the highest in the nation.

KTVA: “Saturday afternoon, Alan and Shandy Cuellar held their fairytale wedding at the Bayshore Clubhouse in south Anchorage in front of nearly 100 of their family and friends -- and a curious moose. Just days before the wedding, Shandy went to the venue to meet with her wedding coordinator to go over the setup. As they were looking around, they noticed a moose at the pond and they both said how amazing it would be if that was the backdrop to their wedding photos. Sure enough, just before the couple’s first kiss as husband and wife, they heard something behind them.
Theres no correlation between primary turnout and wins in the fall in the last 11 elections.	The first table shows that over the last decade there has been a clear correlation between the primary vote of governments and their leader. But conversely, the second table shows virtually no correlation between the fortunes of oppositions and their leaders. The implication is clear, people only really pass judgment on leaders when they are actually leading; the mythology of Kevin 07 aside, governments are removed when they cease to deliver for the Australian people. Think about it and it makes sense. Labor won in 2007 because John Howard had overreached on industrial relations and generally outlived his welcome.
The last time Republicans held hostage a resolution to ensure that our countrys bills were paid cost us more than $1 billion in added interest and slowed the economic recovery.	EU-US trade in goods and services is worth more than €1 trillion euros ($1.2 trillion) each year. The European Union said earlier this week that America's trading partners could retaliate against nearly $300 billion of US exports if the Trump administration decides to penalize automobile imports from around the world. Related: EU warns Trump's car tariffs threaten $300 billion of US exports
In May, the US government launched an investigation into imports of automobiles, including SUVs, light trucks and auto parts. The type of investigation, known as Section 232, is meant to determine whether the imports are hurting US national security. It's the same approach the Trump administration used before it slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum imports earlier this year.
Africa is spending the highest percentage of their GDP on education of any part of the world.	Delivering a speech in Newcastle on Thursday, he said: “At the moment, protectionism is largely just talk (and tweets). But what if rhetoric becomes reality?”
Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.
Recent studies have confirmed that any academic benefits of government funded preschool disappear by the fourth grade.	Teddy Roosevelt hopped on whistle stop tour after whistle stop tour where he was able to drop into rural and suburban communities alike to deliver short, pre-packaged speeches that local papers would usually print verbatim. (He left them short on purpose for that very reason.) Franklin Roosevelt revolutionized and heightened the stature of the office with his fireside chats, that brought his message over the heads of the pesky press corps and directly into the living rooms of the American people. But, though it would have been seen as a scoop, even the reporters covering Lyndon B. Johnson had the good sense not to report on every turd he dropped in their presence. While the founders envisioned a government that moved slowly and methodically, today’s Wi-Fi-enabled political discourse is demanding the opposite.
"The top 1 percent of income earners pay 40 percent of all state income taxes, and those at the bottom pay little or nothing."	The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago. “My mortgage (payment) jumped when they did the last assessment because the taxes were going up,” said Lawrence, who works as a Tribune finance manager. She called the new assessment a “disappointment, because I think during the prior years I was being over-taxed.” In areas where reassessments have gone up, many a taxpayer is nervous about what will come in 2019, when tax bills will be based on the new assessments. Given the assessor’s track record, many homeowners aren’t convinced Berrios got it right.
"The Federal Register - which houses all Washington regulations - is 34,000 pages in length and weighs in at more than 340 pounds."	Over the fireplace at Mingo Creek Craft Distillers, a whiskey purveyor in the small town of Washington, Pennsylvania, a portrait of Alexander Hamilton hangs upside down. With snowy hair and a black velvet jacket, Hamilton wears an impassive look that might be described as hauteur. In 1791, to pay off debts the newly formed United States incurred during the revolutionary war, Hamilton imposed the first federal tax on the people of the region. By taxing their most lucrative product, whiskey, he became what he is here today: a villain representing the excesses of the federal government. The town of Washington is only a six-hour drive from Manhattan, but it’s a world away from the Broadway stage where Hamilton, clad in snug white knickers, enjoys a better reputation.

The number of African-American men in prison has increased fivefold since he left office.	Roger Swindells, from the prison's Independent Monitoring Board, cited a number of problems within the jail, including overcrowding, with inmates in the Victorian cells facing cramped conditions with cockroaches and rat infestations. Image caption HMP Birmingham, formerly known as Winson Green Prison, has been run by G4S since 2011
He said there was also a high sickness rate among officers and problems with staff retention. G4S, which currently runs five of the 14 privately-run jails in the UK, took over the management of the prison in 2011. It promised to "continue to invest" in Birmingham, which holds more than 1,400 inmates. Image caption Carl Brookes and Ross Queen were both cleared of prison mutiny but admitted taking a selfie during the riot
But Stuart Weddell, who worked at the jail from 1995 until October of last year, said staffing numbers, including among the most experienced staff, had been cut to unsafe levels since the firm took over.
"Says at the state level were spending more on tax expenditures than we are on public safety, health care and education combined."	'We’re going to run different'
His theory is that by having "real" conversations about the pervasive issues in Oklahoma and the ones that have touched his own home — and listening to both sides — voters will show up to the polls. As Oklahoma made the most dramatic cuts to education funding since the 2008 recession — decreasing funding per student by 23.6 percent, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, at the same, the state also ranked second in the nation for overall incarceration in 2016, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. For Crowley, these issues are first and foremost. He said he sees too often the cycle of incarceration breaking up families, even his own, and he’s plagued with anxiety over his brother’s future.
We have more hospitals that are childrens hospitals than any other state in the union. 	"His exact words were, 'There's definitely a glitch in the system and we have to fix it,'" Tackett said. The "glitch" has resulted in some bizarre outcomes at his dental practice, Tackett said. In one case a mother, who is disabled, brought in three of her children, all previously covered by Medicaid. But when Tackett checked their eligibility through the state Medicaid computer system available to health providers, he found only one of children had retained dental benefits. The mother and two other children had been cut off though all should have been covered, Tackett said.
"In head-to-head polls for the general election, I beat Hillary Clinton by more than anybody, by 11 points."	"No president in history will ever have campaigned for a midterm like this one," Bannon said.

And Trump's recent record gives him a lot to talk about, Bannon said. "Four percent growth, record low unemployment, China confronted and peace in Korea," Bannon said of what Trump may be able to run on in 2020.
Says former U.S. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter refused to host town hall meetings during her time in Congress.	Yet those people were served. And since it is in Virginia, was Sanders even the first member of the Trump administration to eat there? Maybe others less recognizable had already come and gone. As for “compassion,” what compassion are you showing for someone who, for all you know, may struggle with certain elements of her job herself? What compassion are you showing in a country where the Supreme Court just ruled on gay customers being denied services in a cake shop, yet your gay staff members want you to refuse service to someone they don’t like?
In Malaysia many of the workers are indentured servants because their passports are taken away when they come into this country and are working in slave-like conditions.	Key to Trump’s election was the issue of mass illegal and legal immigration, wherein the United States admits more than 1.5 million immigrants every year. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of white Americans say immigration to the U.S. has made life in America “worse.”
The Reuters poll also comes as the Democratic Party is increasingly built on a platform of open borders in the hopes of diversifying the American electorate to dramatically change the direction of the country. Overall, the U.S. is on track to bring in about 15 million new foreign born voters in the next 20 years, as the country continues admitting more than one million legal immigrants every year, as Breitbart News noted. This booming foreign born population is likely to hand electoral dominance over to Democrats.
On calling Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor a racist.	Once the Supreme Court nominee is confirmed by the Senate, the president must issue a written commission to his nominee. Afterward, the nominee needs to be sworn in – taking two oaths of office – before assuming his official position on the nation's highest court. Fox News’ Judson Berger, John Roberts and The Associated Press have contributed to this report.
Ninety six percent of employers in the Granite State are considered small businesses.	The proposal would:
Legalize the possession and sale of up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana for personal, recreational use for people over the age of 21. A person could keep up to 10 ounces of marijuana at home. Tax marijuana sales with a 10 percent excise tax at the retail level as well as the state's 6 percent sales tax. Split those revenues, with 35 percent going to K-12 education, 35 percent to roads, 15 percent to the communities that allow marijuana businesses in their communities and 15 percent to counties where marijuana business are located. Allow communities to decide whether they’ll allow marijuana businesses in their towns.
"Amiddle-class family donates $1 to charity, they get 15 cents off their income tax. Bill Gates donates $1 to charity, he takes 35 cents off his income tax."	Contrast that with Hyde Park Township, which encompasses a large swath of the South Side, where home sales prices have varied significantly in a mix of differing neighborhoods. Overall, the median home assessment was down by about a third of 1 percent, but with great fluctuations that ranged from a nearly 19 percent increase in the Hyde Park neighborhood to a nearly 19 percent decrease in the 7th Ward’s East Side neighborhood. In middle-class Chatham, the median assessment is down nearly 10 percent. The reassessment notice on Lawrence’s home showed a 12-percent drop. The 37-year-old mother of a young girl said she believes her new $126,000 assessment is in keeping with what her 1,100-square-foot house is truly worth, though she paid tens of thousands dollars more for it less than three years ago.
On the use of presidentially appointed commissions.	In what ways should these concerns shape congressional expectations about transparency of the nominee vetting process and the standards for recusal in cases involving President Trump’s legal affairs? Consider first the not-unlikely prospect of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who has developed a robust view of presidential immunity from legal process fully consistent with some of the more aggressive positions of the president and his legal team. Kavanaugh has written that:
Congress might consider a law exempting a President—while in office—from criminal prosecution and investigation, including from questioning by criminal prosecutors or defense counsel. Criminal investigations targeted at or revolving around a President are inevitably politicized by both their supporters and critics. As I have written before, “no Attorney General or special counsel will have the necessary credibility to avoid the inevitable charges that he is politically motivated—whether in favor of the President or against him, depending on the individual leading the investigation and its results.” The indictment and trial of a sitting President, moreover, would cripple the federal government, rendering it unable to function with credibility in either the international or domestic arenas.
"Marco Rubio is a ""Miami lobbyist."""	“He beat all 15 of those candidates that he faced (crushed many).”

Collins, who has previously bucked party lines on other key issues such as health care, said she plans to have an in-depth conversation with the nominee. She emphasized that there were certain people on Trump's candidate list that she wouldn't vote for, though she didn't specify who those people were. She said she believed it would be inappropriate to ask a nominee how they would vote on a future case. But she emphasized that they had to talk about precedent.
Mitchell International Airport is the the third busiest airport in the world and the number one busiest in the country.	“That was the last photo we took of her,” she says.

She showed Trump a photo of Megumi and her family, which she said he looked on frowning. “This is unacceptable and this must not be forgiven,” Yokota says Trump told her.
"Georgia is one of seven states to lose jobs in 2011 and has lost 8,200 jobs so far."	Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) trashed the June jobs report — even though it showed rapid job growth, rising wages, and low unemployment. The report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that employers created 213,000 new jobs in June — 22,000 more than economists had expected. Manufacturing jobs in particular rose by 36,000. The unemployment rate rose slightly, from 3.8% to 4.0% — but that was partly because so many people are entering (or re-entering) the labor force. Hispanic unemployment hit an all-time low of 4.6%, while black unemployment was at its second-lowest level ever, at 6.5%.

I never considered myself a maverick.	I maintained an infrequent presence in local gyms, even though none of the muscle I packed on put a dent in my self-hatred.

It never helped my self-image. It only made me despise myself more and more.
Mitt Romney says the Arizona immigration law should be a model for the nation.	I look very much forward to working with him. There is much to be done that will benefit both the United States and Mexico! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 2, 2018
“I think he’s gonna try and help us with border,” Trump told the reporters. He described “unbelievably bad border laws, immigration laws” in the United States, calling them “the weakest in the world, laughed at by everybody in the world.” He contrasted the U.S. immigration laws with “Mexico’s very strong immigration laws.”
Trump suggested that Mexico can help the United States “until we straighten out our immigration laws, which have been bad for many, many years, decades.” He further assured, “We’re gonna have them taken care of.”

“The same sort of thing is true for a place like New York,” Frey added. “There has always been huge movement going from New York to Florida, but during the Great Recession period that slowed up quite a bit, and now it is picking up again.”
Frey added that the reasons behind the decline in population in cities like Los Angeles and New York -- overcrowding and high prices -- are very different than the reasons for decreases in other cities on this list, notably Rust Belt cities like Flint, Michigan; Toledo, Ohio; and Rockford, Illinois; and even larger cities like St. Louis, Cleveland, and Milwaukee.

Do this research watch how much crime picks up if you take away [football].	The justice department said in the report that while it recognises strip searches are an “intrusive” practice, it is considering alternatives, including reducing the number of searches. Glass also found it “troubling” that prison numbers and the cost to the public are at record highs, with each prisoner now costing the state an average of $127,000 a year. The prison population has soared by 20% since the 2015 report. Almost half of all prisoners released reoffend and return to prison within two years. “As the government tightens sentencing and bail conditions, and builds more prisons, there is no indication that these trends are likely to change,” Glass said.
The five Guantanamo detainees swapped for Bowe Bergdahl are back on the battlefield.	Ethiopia's government has fired five prison officials as it confronts allegations of torture and other abuses of inmates as part of a wave of reforms. Among those fired is the federal prison chief who until recently defended the treatment of inmates as "fair." The firings came ahead of a new Human Rights Watch report released Thursday that documents widespread arbitrary detention, torture, rape and humiliation over several years in Ethiopia's eastern Somali region. It urges new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to investigate the "horrific" situation. Abiy has admitted that security forces have tortured people but has yet to "tackle Ethiopia's culture of impunity and ensure accountability," said Felix Horne, senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch.
(After the auto bailout) General Motors is back on top as the worlds No. 1 automaker.

About 70 percent of the parts in a U.S.-built Camry, the country's best-selling car, come from domestic suppliers. Toyota on June 27 said that Trump's threatened 25 percent tariff on automotive imports would add $1,800 to the price of each sedan. The carmaker's warning of the dangers of tit-for-tat tariffs was just one of many. German lighting manufacturer Osram Licht's shares plunged 22 percent Thursday after it announced a weaker outlook due to trade tensions.
Martin Luther King Jr. was a Republican.	It's difficult to imagine Old Hickory, as he was known, excusing himself from military duty on the grounds that he could not march long distances, as Mr Trump did during the Vietnam War, citing bone spurs. The parallels between the 45th president and the 13th - unlucky for some - are arguably more compelling. Fillmore launched his career in the 1820s with the Anti-Masonic Party, hawking a paranoid rumour that ruling Freemasons were murdering whistleblowers. Mr Trump paved the way for his White House bid by peddling a conspiracy theory, too - that President Barack Obama was not a US citizen.

"Every single day in this country, 1,000 people are deported and the vast majority of those people that are deported arent criminals."	These numbers are similar to those from a February Quinnipiac poll, where 49 percent of voters said Trump was racist and 46 percent said he was not. Forty-four percent of voters said they think “racist beliefs” were a motive in Trump’s immigration policy, while 50 percent said Trump has “a sincere interest in controlling our borders.” Sixty percent said the policy of separating children from their parents at the border was a violation of human rights. Since enacting the policy, Trump and his associates have repeatedly pushed false, racist narratives to garner support, often associating immigration with high crime rates despite no evidence to support claims that immigrants commit more crime than U.S. citizens. While only 11 percent of Republican voters in the Quinnipiac poll said they think Trump is a racist, 22 percent said they believe Trump has emboldened racist people to express their beliefs publicly. The number of hate crimes rose the year Trump was elected ― the first increase in over a decade.

There are fewer than 450 North Atlantic right whales left in the world, and Canada is under international pressure to step up protection of the species, after 12 of the animals were killed last year in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence – many of them in collisions with ships and some after becoming tangled in fishing gear. Scientists believe climate change is causing the species to shift its feeding grounds into the Gulf, putting it on a collision course with the shipping and fishing industries. US lawmakers, meanwhile, say Canada isn’t doing enough to protect the whales and are threatening to block Canadian fishermen from selling lobster into the American market.

Fox News again dominated for the second quarter of 2018 not only in cable news, but in all of cable, while CNN landed in last place by a country mile. For the eighth straight quarter, Fox was the most-watched network in all of cable. With an average of 1.409 million total day viewers, Fox attracted nearly as many eyeballs as MSNBC and CNN combined. MSNBC averaged just 930,000 viewers, while CNN nosedived with an average of just 658,000. During primetime, Fox snagged an average of 2.447 million viewers, compared to MSNBC’s 1.736 million.

Every (personhood) bill Ive ever support has either had language that says were conforming to the constitutional rulings of the Supreme Court or something to that effect.	Referendum to remove ‘outdated’ clause encouraging mothers to choose domestic duties over paid employment to be held by November
Ireland to vote over constitution clause on women's role in the home
Ireland will hold a referendum to remove a clause in the constitution marking the importance of a woman’s “life within the home” and encouraging mothers to shun paid employment to fulfil domestic duties, the government has announced. The move unveiled on Thursday is the latest to update Ireland’s socially conservative 1937 constitution to reflect a more secular and socially liberal population. Ireland was long one of Europe’s most socially conservative countries, but opinions have changed rapidly in recent decades as the power of the Roman Catholic church has waned. A 2015 referendum introduced gay marriage into the constitution and a vote earlier this year allowed access to abortion. The constitution, which includes a number of references to the country’s traditional Christian ethos, currently contains a clause that “recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the state a support without which the common good cannot be achieved”.
Says Scott Brown voted to give oil companies big tax breaks.	President Trump had suggested lifting the prohibition, which environmentalists charge would raise levels of ground ozone during warmer months, during his campaign for the White House. Following the news of Mr. Pruitt’s resignation, Mr. Dinneen wrote that there was a “collective sigh of relief coming from the Midwest,” calling the 2019 ethanol quotas “the straw that broke the camel’s back.”
While it is too early to say how the handling of waivers or the treatment of E15 may change under new leadership, one indicator was small losses in affected refiners in early Friday trading and gains in most ethanol producers. CVR Refining, Andeavor and Delek U.S. Holdings , all of which benefited from waivers granted by the EPA, had rallied by 136%, 40% and 92% in the year ended Thursday, respectively. Ethanol companies Pacific Ethanol and Green Plains had fallen by 60% and 14%, respectively. Agricultural lobbyists often portray any easing of the rules as a sop to “big oil,” but that isn’t accurate.

A recent study by the Center for Union Facts revealed that, from 2010 to 2017, labor unions in general sent some $1.3 billion in member dues to progressive groups aligned with the Democratic Party without obtaining the approval of their members. The data showed, for example, that America Votes received $15.1 million from union member dues, while the Democratic Governors Association was the recipient of $14.5 million. Abortion vendor Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.2 million from union members through their union dues. As the Washington Post reported following the 2016 presidential election, some 40 percent of union household members vote Republican, and likely would not approve of their union dues being donated by union leadership to left-wing groups.

Analysts say tariffs are not the most effective way of putting pressure on China, which the US accuses of unfair trade practices and stealing intellectual property from US companies. Syracuse University economics professor Mary Lovely and researcher Yang Liang found 87% of electronics products to be levied by US tariffs came from multinationals and joint ventures rather than Chinese firms. China’s economy is no longer as dependent on exports. Domestic consumption now accounts for more than half of the country’s GDP. Exports to the US account for only 19% of all of China’s exports.

Revealing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street, the governor said the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario – akin to a full-scale trade war – would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. “There is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,” he said.
Odd fact for odd draft: No. 2 overall pick will earn more than the No. 1 pick due to no state tax in Florida. So 2 not so bad.	Economists have warned the import tariffs could disrupt the supply chain, undermine business investment and raise prices for consumers, and wipe out the stimulus from a $1.5 trillion tax cut package that came into effect in January. “As with the manufacturing report released on Tuesday, there was plenty of anecdotal evidence that tariffs were beginning to have an impact, but with the prices balance falling in June and new export orders rising, there is little sign that this is affecting the economy yet,” said Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York. TRUCK DRIVER SHORTAGE
Services industries also complained about difficulties finding qualified workers, especially truck drivers, which some said was “getting worse each month.” There are a record 6.7 million unfilled jobs. The ISM survey’s measure of service industry employment slipped in June, but continued to show growth. Some industries said they “need to hire more people,” and others noted that “employee retention is getting much more competitive.”
Separately, the ADP National Employment Report showed private employers hired 177,000 workers in June, less than market expectations for a 190,000 gain.
"One industry in America has increased its employment base in the last four years by 176,000 people: the United States government."

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Sunday that President Donald Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court should not seek to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that enshrined abortion rights in the United States. “Roe v. Wade is a constitutional right that is well-established,” Collins said on “State of the Union” on CNN. “And no less an authority than Chief Justice [John] Roberts said that repeatedly at his confirmation hearing.“

Trump last week said he wouldn’t ask potential Supreme Court nominees about abortion rights — a departure from his stance on the campaign trail, when he said he would only nominate justices to the Supreme Court who oppose abortion. “I think what he said as the candidate may not have been informed by the legal advice that he now has,” Collins told Jake Tapper.

Scott Pruitt, who has finally stepped down as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency after a long-rumbling corruption scandal, rose to public prominence on the back of a series of increasingly outlandish ethical controversies. Scott Pruitt resigns: Trump's scandal-ridden EPA chief steps down Read more
From lobbying fast food company Chick-fil-A on behalf of his wife, to demanding his staff acquire a mattress from a Trump Hotel – not to mention the millions of taxpayer dollars spent on security, first-class travel and soundproof booths – Pruitt’s behavior clashed spectacularly with any pretense of Trump’s pledge to “drain the swamp” in Washington. But the lasting legacy of the former Oklahoma attorney general – who was picked by Trump after crusading against what he called the EPA’s “activist agenda” – is likely to be felt in the systematic weakening of environmental regulations. While not as eye-catching as, for example, his demand that his official vehicle use sirens so he could reach a French restaurant on time, Pruitt’s actions at the EPA have left behind a demoralized agency where staff fret that their ability to protect public health has been diminished. A staunch ally of oil and gas companies, Pruitt stacked EPA advisory boards with industry representatives and sought to set aside whole troves of research that link pollution to various illnesses.

For much of America’s railroad era, travelers to and from New York had to get off their trains and take ferries across the Hudson River. But in 1910—when William Howard Taft was president, the Titanic was under construction and America’s fastest car was powered by steam—the Pennsylvania Railroad bored two single-track tunnels through the rock beneath the river, an achievement that finally allowed train travel straight from New Jersey to the majestic new Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. That same year, the railroad eased another bottleneck on the same line a few miles west by building a double-track bridge over the Hackensack River, with a detachable section that rotated open whenever boats needed to pass. Today, American transportation is radically different.

Says North Carolina Republican Senate candidate Thom Tillis called Obamacare a great idea.	The first, Antonio Halili, was the mayor of the much larger Tanauan City, south of Manila. Unlike Bote, Halili had developed both a reputation for having a heavy hand against drug traffickers and negotiating with them. Halili appeared on a more recent Duterte list of elected officials with ties to drug trafficking in 2017. Shortly after Halili’s assassination, Duterte told reporters, “I don’t know who killed him, but I told you don’t [engage in illegal drugs]. … His procession of drug suspects was just a front.”
Prior to this accusation, however, Halili had established a “walk of shame” program where he paraded drug suspects around his city for the public to jeer, leading others in the government to suggest he was killed by drug traffickers in revenge for humiliating their peers.

Began his career in environmental law at the EPA, as a special assistant in the agency's toxics office during President George H.W. Spent years playing various roles on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, which oversees the EPA, drafting regulations on chemical safety, air and water pollution and climate change — generally seeking to reduce government regulations on industries that generate greenhouse gases. Served as longtime aide to Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., whom you may recall from the 2015 floor speech in which he rebutted climate change science with a snowball. After leaving Congress, worked for years as a lobbyist for some of the largest coal, chemical and uranium companies in the U.S. — including the uranium mining firm that pushed for the reduction of Bears Ears National Monument, which is near one of its processing facilities.

The basic deal is well understood by policymakers in both countries, with U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly emphasizing his great personal relationship with the Saudi king and crown prince.

"The Republican budget plan says that 10 years from now, if youre a 65-year-old whos eligible for Medicare, you should have to pay nearly $6,400 more than you would today."	“That was a very sad day for the country when that vote was cast,” Trump said in June. But Republican lawmakers dispute arguments suggesting their efforts to undo ObamaCare have been totally fruitless. “We eliminated the individual mandate that said that people had to buy government-approved insurance,” said Sen.

"According to a recent Congressional Budget Office report, under Obamacare, 7 million people will lose their employer-sponsored insurance."	As the landscape for the midterm elections takes shape, Democrats are hoping to find success in 2018 by pledging to protect a law that was signed eight years ago. The same law former Vice President Joe Biden declared was a “big f---ing deal,” ObamaCare. Democratic candidates already have flooded airwaves with 9,600 advertisements expressing support for the Affordable Care Act, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Now, party leaders are framing the upcoming battle over President Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee as one that’s really about President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. “He’s looking for someone on the court who will make sure that they rule that the Affordable Care Act’s protection of those with pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said on “Fox News Sunday.” “That’ll mean thousands, if not millions, of Americans will lose their health insurance.”

An interactive online HIV prevention program has reduced the sexually transmitted infection rates of gonorrhea and chlamydia by 40 percent among young gay and bisexual men, the first such approach to show an impact on sexual health, a new study found. The program, “Keep It Up!,” challenges traditional sexual education models and seeks to “keep up” HIV negative test results and educate racially and ethnically diverse at-risk gay and bisexual youth through soap operas, interactive games and real-world simulations. The program targets men 18 to 29 who have sex with men, a group that is disproportionately affected by HIV infections in the U.S. While this group represents only 2 percent of all young people, it accounts for 70 percent of HIV diagnoses according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Keep It Up!” is made up of different modules involving interactive games, exercises, a simulation at a bar and a soap opera.

The USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll of 1,004 adults, taken online June 26-27, has a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The survey is one of a year-long series on American values.
"Today, about 40 percent of guns are purchased without a background check."	"For a good few years we did see a decrease in the number of young people reportedly taking substances. "But over the last 12 to 18 months we have seen a slight increase."
"The Democrats have over 20 field agents to our zero."""	Corporate America couldn’t hire Republican lobbyists fast enough after President Donald Trump’s election gave the GOP unified control of Washington. Now there are signs that Democrats are back in demand. Companies and trade groups are trying to hire congressional staffers with ties to influential House Democrats four months ahead of the midterm elections, in which Democrats are expected to pick up seats and potentially retake control of the House. Lobbyists are helping their clients meet with the Democrats who would become committee chairs if the party does win back the chamber. And trade groups are talking to members about what to expect from a Democratic takeover.
Social Security is a Ponzi scheme.	The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) spent a total of $4 billion on improper food stamp payments to those receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the USDA confirmed with Breitbart News on Friday. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service announced this week that improper payments made up 6.3 percent of SNAP money in the fiscal year (FY) 2017—the latest data available from the agency. Breitbart News analyzed the USDA’s data on food stamp spending and found that $4,007,026,532 of the $63,603,595,754 the agency spent on SNAP in FY 2017 went to improper payments. The USDA told Breitbart News that “it is important to note that improper payments include both overpayments and underpayments,” meaning that households on SNAP that received less than what they were supposed to receive for the month are also included in the percentage rate. Brandon Lipps, the Acting Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services at the agency, said that most improper payments are due to “human errors”—either because of state agencies miscalculating benefits or benefit recipients giving state agencies the wrong information.
Says Nick Rahall voted with Obama 94 percent of the time.	A limited paper trail on the appeals court worries some conservatives. He is not known as a great legal theorist like Kavanaugh, nor is he a "feeder judge" whose law clerks are snapped up by Supreme Court justices. While Kavanaugh has sent 41 clerks there, Hardiman has sent none. Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2IPavRg
"In 2011, texting surpassed alcohol as the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths."	That doesn’t require a smartphone in every hand. Many schools are already doing this as they see the benefits and have simply created their own policy that delivers the same effect. I think heads can be persuaded that such policies would fit and benefit all schools. Carolyn Roberts

I wonder if there’s a school anywhere that allows unfettered access to phones all day every day? I don’t impose a blanket ban, but we do have rules.
"The vast majority of (Syrian) refugees are young, able-bodied men looking for work."	We saw babies who had been born within weeks before. It is overwhelmingly young men, but there's certainly young women. MARTIN: Do we have a sense of where most of the migrants were coming from to begin with?
The Republican leader of the Senate said his main goal after this election is simply to win the next one.	The current medical staffer went to the shooting range to practice this weekend. “I think rioting or hurting staff unfortunately could be just around the corner,” the staffer told HuffPost.
Rick Scott increased tuition at our state colleges and universities by double digits.	It was no surprise to read that the very first lesson you suggest could be learned from overseas (Five things the NHS could do to improve service, 3 July) is the establishment of integrated health and social care, as has happened in New Zealand. The achievements of the Attlee government are at the heart of my socialist beliefs but the compromises which led then to the split between free NHS care and means-tested social care remain the achilles heel as the NHS celebrates 70 years. It is utterly ludicrous to have separate systems which imply distinct and neat boundaries between health and care, with rather a lot of people making a good living arguing on which side of the fence some poor demented soul belongs. Disputes around the funding of continuing care have become a major industry. The recent NHS funding announcement, making no reference whatsoever to social care, evidenced the fact that the government still hasn’t the least idea of how the two are umbilically linked.
Our men and women of the Guard have been forced to contact food banks to feed themselves.	Millions are near famine and aid delivery is often blocked in one of the world's most dangerous countries for humanitarian workers. Both sides have been accused of abuses including gang-rapes, sometimes along ethnic lines. ———

Says Scott Walkers views on abortion are more restrictive than any Republican president in recent times.	ZURICH, July 2 (Reuters) - Swiss asset manager GAM Holding told employees it was preparing for a “worst case” Brexit scenario in which Britain gives up full access to the single market and customs union with the European Union, the Financial Times reported on Monday, citing an internal company email. “We are basing our contingency planning on the worst case,” the email said. Zurich-headquartered GAM later told the Financial Times it was “well placed to respond to any potential outcome of Brexit negotiations” with its operations across the EU, including most of its funds which are based in Ireland or Luxembourg, in response to questions about the email.
